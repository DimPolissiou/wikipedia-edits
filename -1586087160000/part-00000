It was located in southwest [[Caria]] on a picturesque, advantageous site on the [[Gulf of G\u00f6kova|Ceramic Gulf]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Halicarnassus |volume=12 |pages=837\u2013838} |first=David George |last=Hogarth |inline=1}}</ref> The city was famous for the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], also known simply as the Tomb of [[Mausolus]], whose name provided the origin of the word \"[[mausoleum]]\". The mausoleum, built from 353 to 350&nbsp;BC, ranked as one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]].\n\nHalicarnassus' history was special on two interlinked issues. Halicarnassus retained a monarchical system of government at a time when most other Greek city states had long since rid themselves of their kings. And secondly, while their Ionian neighbours rebelled against Persian rule, Halicarnassus remained loyal to the Persians and formed part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] until [[Alexander the Great]] captured it at the [[siege of Halicarnassus]] in 334&nbsp;BC.\n\nHalicarnassus originally occupied only a small island near to the shore called Zephyria, which was the original name of the settlement and the present site of the great [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of St. Peter]] built by the [[Knights of Rhodes]] in 1404. However, in the course of time, the island united with the mainland, and the city was extended to incorporate [[Salmacis (Caria)|Salmacis]], an older town of the [[Leleges]] and [[Carians]]<ref name=EB1911/> and site of the later citadel.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe suffix -\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 (-assos) of Greek \u1f09\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 is indicative of a [[Pre-Greek substrate | substrate]] toponym, meaning that an original non-Greek name influenced, or established the place's name. (Compare [[Parnassus]].)

According to Turkish archaeologist Yusuf Boysal, the Muskebi material, dating from the end of the fifteenth century BC to ca. 1200 BC, provides evidence of the presence, in this region, of a Mycenaean settlement.<ref name=Yusuf>Yusuf Boysal, [http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/14/701/8862.pdf New Excavations in Caria (PDF)], Anadolu, (1967), 32\u201356.</ref>\n\nMore than forty burial places dating back to that time have been discovered. A rich collection of artifacts found in these tombs is now housed in the [[Bodrum Castle]].\n\nThese finds cast some light on the problem of determining the territories of ancient [[Arzawa]] and [[Achaeans (Homer)|Ahhiyawa]].<ref name =Yusuf />\n\n===Early history===\n\n[[Image:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Herodotus]] (Greek: \u1f29\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) is honored with a statue in his home of Halicarnassus (modern [[Bodrum]]).]]\n\nThe founding of Halicarnassus is debated among various traditions; but they agree in the main point as to its being a [[Dorians|Dorian]] colony, and the figures on its coins, such as the head of [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]], [[Athena]] or [[Poseidon]], or the trident, support the statement that the mother cities were [[Troezen]] and [[Argos]]. The inhabitants appear to have accepted Anthes, a son of Poseidon, as their legendary founder, as mentioned by [[Strabo]], and were proud of the title of ''Antheadae''.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAt an early period Halicarnassus was a member of the [[Doric Hexapolis]], which included [[Kos]], [[Cnidus]], [[Lindos]], [[Kameiros]] and [[Ialysus]]; but it was expelled from the league when one of its citizens, Agasicles, took home the prize tripod which he had won in the Triopian games, instead of dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian Apollo. In the early 5th century Halicarnassus was under the sway of [[Artemisia I of Caria]] (also known as Artemesia of Halicarnassus), who made herself famous as a naval commander at the [[battle of Salamis]]. Of Pisindalis, her son and successor, little is known. Artemisia's grandson [[Lygdamis II of Halicarnassus]], is notorious for having put to death the poet [[Panyasis]] and causing [[Herodotus]], possibly the best known Halicarnassian, to leave his native city (c. 457&nbsp;BC).<ref>{{cite book|title=Suda|chapter=Herodotus|chapter-url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&search_method=QUERY&login=guest&enlogin=guest&user_list=LIST&page_num=1&searchstr=herodotus&field=hw_eng|title-link=Suda}} At the Suda On Line Project.</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Hekatomnid dynasty===\n[[Hecatomnus]] became king of Caria, at that time part of the Persian Empire, ruling from 404&nbsp;BC to 358&nbsp;BC and establishing the Hekatomnid dynasty. He left three sons, Mausolus, [[Idrieus]] and [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]]\u2014all of whom\u2014in their turn, succeeded him in the sovereignty; and two daughters, [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]] and [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who were married to their brothers Mausolus and Idrieus.\n\n[[File:Mausoleum at Halicarnassus at the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], at the [[Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology]].]]\n[[File:Persian sphinx at Halicarnassus.jpg|thumb|upright|Persian [[sphinx]] from Halicarnassus, 355 BC.]]\nMausolus moved his capital from [[Mylasa]] to Halicarnassus.

And on one side of the harbor they built a massive fortified palace for Mausolus, positioned to have clear views out to sea and inland to the hills\u2014places from where enemies could attack. On land, the workmen also built walls and [[watchtower]]s, a [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek]]&ndash;style theatre and a [[Greek temple|temple]] to [[Ares]]\u2014the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[God (male deity)|god]] of war.\n\nArtemisia and Mausolus spent huge amounts of tax money to embellish the city. They commissioned statues, temples and buildings of gleaming [[marble]]. When he died in 353&nbsp;BC, his wife, sister and successor, [[Artemisia II of Caria]], began construction of a magnificent tomb for him and herself on a hill overlooking the city. She died in 351 BC (of grief, according to Cicero, ''Tusculan Disputations'' 3.31). According to [[Pliny the Elder]] the craftsmen continued to work on the tomb after the death of their patron, \"considering that it was at once a memorial of his own fame and of the sculptor's art,\" finishing it in 350&nbsp;BC. This tomb of Mausolus came to be known as the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus|Mausoleum]], one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]].\n\nArtemisia was succeeded by her brother Idrieus, who, in turn, was succeeded by his wife and sister Ada when he died in 344&nbsp;BC. However, Ada was usurped by her brother Pixodarus in 340&nbsp;BC. On the death of Pixodarus in 335&nbsp;BC his son-in-law, a Persian named [[Orontobates]], received the satrapy of Caria from [[Darius III of Persia]].\n\n===Alexander the Great and Ada of Caria===\n{{Main article|Siege of Halicarnassus}}\n[[File:The siege and capture of Halicarnassus under Alexander the Great.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The siege and capture of Halicarnassus under Alexander the Great.]]\nWhen [[Alexander the Great]] entered Caria in 334&nbsp;BC, [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who was in possession of the fortress of [[Alinda]], surrendered the fortress to him. After taking Halicarnassus, Alexander handed back the government of Caria to her; she, in turn, formally adopted Alexander as her son, ensuring that the rule of Caria passed unconditionally to him upon her eventual death. During the [[siege of Halicarnassus]] the city was fired by the retreating Persians. As he was not able to reduce the citadel, Alexander was forced to leave it blockaded.<ref name=EB1911/> The ruins of this citadel and moat are now a tourist attraction in Bodrum.\n\n===Later history===\nNot long afterwards the citizens received the present of a gymnasium from [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and built in his honour a ''stoa'' or portico.<ref name=EB1911/> Under Egyptian hegemony, around 268 BC, a citizen named [[Hermias of Halicarnassus|Hermias]] became [[Nesiarch]] of the [[Nesiotic League]] in the [[Cyclades]].<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/1600370/Identity_and_resistance_the_Islanders_League_the_Aegean_islands_and_the_Hellenistic_kings C.

The building consisted of five parts\u2014a basement or podium, a pteron or enclosure of columns, a pyramid, a pedestal and a chariot group. The basement, covering an area of 114 feet by 92, was built of blocks of greenstone, cased with marble and covered in carvings of cows. Round the base of it were probably disposed groups of statuary. The pteron consisted (according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]) of thirty-six columns of the [[Ionic order]], enclosing a square cella. Between the columns probably stood single statues. From the portions that have been recovered, it appears that the principal frieze of the pteron represented combats of Greeks and [[Amazons]]. In addition, there are also many life-size fragments of animals, horsemen, etc., belonging probably to pedimental sculptures, but formerly supposed to be parts of minor friezes. Above the pteron rose the pyramid, mounting by 24 steps to an apex or pedestal.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nOn this apex stood the chariot with the figure of Mausolus himself and an attendant. The height of the statue of Mausolus in the [[British Museum]] is 9'9\" without the plinth. The hair falls from the forehead in thick waves on each side of the face and descends nearly to the shoulder; the beard is short and close, the face square and massive, the eyes deep set under overhanging brows, the mouth well formed with settled calm about the lips. The drapery is grandly composed. All sorts of restorations of this famous monument have been proposed. The original one, made by Newton and Pullan, is obviously in error in many respects; and that of Oldfield, though to be preferred for its lightness (the mausoleum was said anciently to be \"suspended in mid-air\"), does not satisfy the conditions postulated by the remains. The best on the whole is that of the veteran German architect, F. Adler, published in 1900; but fresh studies have since been made (see below).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Notable people ==\n*[[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia I]] ([[floruit|fl]]. 480 BC), Queen of Halicarnassus, who participated in the [[Battle of Salamis]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrVZAAAAYAAJ&q=Artemisia+I+born+in+Halicarnassus&dq=Artemisia+I+born+in+Halicarnassus |title=Great Lives from History: Aaron-Lysippus |first=Christina A. |last=Salowey |first2=Frank Northen |last2=Magill |publisher=Salem Press |year=2004 |page=109 |isbn=9781587651533}}</ref>\n*[[Herodotus]] (c. 484&nbsp;\u2013 c. 425 BC), Greek historian<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHqsBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA62 |title=Lifelines in World History: The Ancient World, The Medieval World, The Early Modern World, The Modern World |first=Ase |last=Berit |first2=Rolf |last2=Strandskogen |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=26 May 2015 |page=62 |isbn=9781317466048}}</ref>\n*[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] ({{circa|60}} \u2013 8 BC), historian and teacher of rhetoric<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmH697Ke7wQC&pg=PA291 |title=Readings from Classical Rhetoric |first=Patricia P. |last=Matsen |first2=Philip B. |last2=Rollinson |first3=Marion |last3=Sousa |publisher=[[SIU Press]] |year=1990 |page=291 |isbn=9780809315932}}</ref>\n* [[Pigres of Halicarnassus]] - Greek poet\n*[[Aelius Dionysius]] (fl. 2nd century), Greek rhetorician and musician\n* Heraclitus of Halicarnassus - Greek [[Elegiac]] Poet<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg7000.tlg001.perseus-grc2:7.80 Greek Anthology Book 7, 7.80]</ref>\n* [[Hegesippus of Halicarnassus]] - a naval commander of [[Antigonus Monophthalmus]]\n* Scylax of Halicarnassus - ancient [[Ancient Greek astronomy|astronomer]]<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione2.shtml#88 Cicero, On Divination, 2.88]</ref><ref>[https://topostext.org/work/562#2.88 Cicero, On Divination, 2.88 in english]</ref>\n* Cleon of Halicarnassus - ancient orator<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/266#2.212 Plutarch, Laconic Apophthegms, Moralia, 2.212]</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg044.perseus-grc1:20 Plutarch, Life of Agesilaus, 20]</ref>\n* Phormio of Halicarnassus - ancient boxer who was a [[List of ancient Olympic victors|victor]] at the boxing in the 97 [[Ancient Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.21.3 Pausanias, Description of Greece, 5.21.3]</ref>\n* Asiaticus of Halicarnassus - ancient victor at the [[Stadion (running race)|Stadion]] in the 197 Ancient Olympic Games<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/531#79 Eusebius, Chronography, 79]</ref>\n* Julian of Halicarnassus - bishop of Halicarnassus and a leader of the [[Monophysites]] in the 6th century<ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/iota/436 Suda Encyclopedia iota,436]</ref><ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/sigma/271 Suda Encyclopedia, si.271]</ref>\n\n==Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Cook, B.

The mausoleum, built from 353 to 350&nbsp;BC, ranked as one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]].\n\nHalicarnassus' history was special on two interlinked issues. Halicarnassus retained a monarchical system of government at a time when most other Greek city states had long since rid themselves of their kings. And secondly, while their Ionian neighbours rebelled against Persian rule, Halicarnassus remained loyal to the Persians and formed part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] until [[Alexander the Great]] captured it at the [[siege of Halicarnassus]] in 334&nbsp;BC.\n\nHalicarnassus originally occupied only a small island near to the shore called Zephyria, which was the original name of the settlement and the present site of the great [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of St. Peter]] built by the [[Knights of Rhodes]] in 1404. However, in the course of time, the island united with the mainland, and the city was extended to incorporate [[Salmacis (Caria)|Salmacis]], an older town of the [[Leleges]] and [[Carians]]<ref name=EB1911/> and site of the later citadel.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe suffix -\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 (-assos) of Greek \u1f09\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 is indicative of a [[Pre-Greek substrate | substrate]] toponym, meaning that an original non-Greek name influenced, or established the place's name. (Compare [[Parnassus]].) It has been recently proposed that the element -\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 is [[cognate]] with [[Luwian language |Luwian]] (CASTRUM)ha+ra/i-na-s\u00e0 / (CASTRUM)ha+ra/i-ni-s\u00e0 'fortress'.<ref>\nIlya Yakubovich. \"Phoenician and Luwian in Early Age Cilicia\".

According to Turkish archaeologist Yusuf Boysal, the Muskebi material, dating from the end of the fifteenth century BC to ca. 1200 BC, provides evidence of the presence, in this region, of a Mycenaean settlement.<ref name=Yusuf>Yusuf Boysal, [http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/14/701/8862.pdf New Excavations in Caria (PDF)], Anadolu, (1967), 32\u201356.</ref>\n\nMore than forty burial places dating back to that time have been discovered. A rich collection of artifacts found in these tombs is now housed in the [[Bodrum Castle]].\n\nThese finds cast some light on the problem of determining the territories of ancient [[Arzawa]] and [[Achaeans (Homer)|Ahhiyawa]].<ref name =Yusuf />\n\n===Early history===\n\n[[Image:herodotusstatue.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Herodotus]] (Greek: \u1f29\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) is honored with a statue in his home of Halicarnassus (modern [[Bodrum]]).]]\n\nThe founding of Halicarnassus is debated among various traditions; but they agree in the main point as to its being a [[Dorians|Dorian]] colony, and the figures on its coins, such as the head of [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]], [[Athena]] or [[Poseidon]], or the trident, support the statement that the mother cities were [[Troezen]] and [[Argos]]. The inhabitants appear to have accepted Anthes, a son of Poseidon, as their legendary founder, as mentioned by [[Strabo]], and were proud of the title of ''Antheadae''.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAt an early period Halicarnassus was a member of the [[Doric Hexapolis]], which included [[Kos]], [[Cnidus]], [[Lindos]], [[Kameiros]] and [[Ialysus]]; but it was expelled from the league when one of its citizens, Agasicles, took home the prize tripod which he had won in the Triopian games, instead of dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian Apollo. In the early 5th century Halicarnassus was under the sway of [[Artemisia I of Caria]] (also known as Artemesia of Halicarnassus), who made herself famous as a naval commander at the [[battle of Salamis]]. Of Pisindalis, her son and successor, little is known. Artemisia's grandson [[Lygdamis II of Halicarnassus]], is notorious for having put to death the poet [[Panyasis]] and causing [[Herodotus]], possibly the best known Halicarnassian, to leave his native city (c. 457&nbsp;BC).<ref>{{cite book|title=Suda|chapter=Herodotus|chapter-url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&search_method=QUERY&login=guest&enlogin=guest&user_list=LIST&page_num=1&searchstr=herodotus&field=hw_eng|title-link=Suda}} At the Suda On Line Project.</ref><ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Hekatomnid dynasty===\n[[Hecatomnus]] became king of Caria, at that time part of the Persian Empire, ruling from 404&nbsp;BC to 358&nbsp;BC and establishing the Hekatomnid dynasty. He left three sons, Mausolus, [[Idrieus]] and [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]]\u2014all of whom\u2014in their turn, succeeded him in the sovereignty; and two daughters, [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]] and [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who were married to their brothers Mausolus and Idrieus.\n\n[[File:Mausoleum at Halicarnassus at the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], at the [[Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology]].]]\n[[File:Persian sphinx at Halicarnassus.jpg|thumb|upright|Persian [[sphinx]] from Halicarnassus, 355 BC.]]\nMausolus moved his capital from [[Mylasa]] to Halicarnassus.

And on one side of the harbor they built a massive fortified palace for Mausolus, positioned to have clear views out to sea and inland to the hills\u2014places from where enemies could attack. On land, the workmen also built walls and [[watchtower]]s, a [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek]]&ndash;style theatre and a [[Greek temple|temple]] to [[Ares]]\u2014the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[God (male deity)|god]] of war.\n\nArtemisia and Mausolus spent huge amounts of tax money to embellish the city. They commissioned statues, temples and buildings of gleaming [[marble]]. When he died in 353&nbsp;BC, his wife, sister and successor, [[Artemisia II of Caria]], began construction of a magnificent tomb for him and herself on a hill overlooking the city. She died in 351 BC (of grief, according to Cicero, ''Tusculan Disputations'' 3.31). According to [[Pliny the Elder]] the craftsmen continued to work on the tomb after the death of their patron, \"considering that it was at once a memorial of his own fame and of the sculptor's art,\" finishing it in 350&nbsp;BC. This tomb of Mausolus came to be known as the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus|Mausoleum]], one of the [[seven wonders of the ancient world]].\n\nArtemisia was succeeded by her brother Idrieus, who, in turn, was succeeded by his wife and sister Ada when he died in 344&nbsp;BC. However, Ada was usurped by her brother Pixodarus in 340&nbsp;BC. On the death of Pixodarus in 335&nbsp;BC his son-in-law, a Persian named [[Orontobates]], received the satrapy of Caria from [[Darius III of Persia]].\n\n===Alexander the Great and Ada of Caria===\n{{Main article|Siege of Halicarnassus}}\n[[File:The siege and capture of Halicarnassus under Alexander the Great.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The siege and capture of Halicarnassus under Alexander the Great.]]\nWhen [[Alexander the Great]] entered Caria in 334&nbsp;BC, [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who was in possession of the fortress of [[Alinda]], surrendered the fortress to him. After taking Halicarnassus, Alexander handed back the government of Caria to her; she, in turn, formally adopted Alexander as her son, ensuring that the rule of Caria passed unconditionally to him upon her eventual death. During the [[siege of Halicarnassus]] the city was fired by the retreating Persians. As he was not able to reduce the citadel, Alexander was forced to leave it blockaded.<ref name=EB1911/> The ruins of this citadel and moat are now a tourist attraction in Bodrum.\n\n===Later history===\nNot long afterwards the citizens received the present of a gymnasium from [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and built in his honour a ''stoa'' or portico.<ref name=EB1911/> Under Egyptian hegemony, around 268 BC, a citizen named [[Hermias of Halicarnassus|Hermias]] became [[Nesiarch]] of the [[Nesiotic League]] in the [[Cyclades]].<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/1600370/Identity_and_resistance_the_Islanders_League_the_Aegean_islands_and_the_Hellenistic_kings C.

The building consisted of five parts\u2014a basement or podium, a pteron or enclosure of columns, a pyramid, a pedestal and a chariot group. The basement, covering an area of 114 feet by 92, was built of blocks of greenstone, cased with marble and covered in carvings of cows. Round the base of it were probably disposed groups of statuary. The pteron consisted (according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]) of thirty-six columns of the [[Ionic order]], enclosing a square cella. Between the columns probably stood single statues. From the portions that have been recovered, it appears that the principal frieze of the pteron represented combats of Greeks and [[Amazons]]. In addition, there are also many life-size fragments of animals, horsemen, etc., belonging probably to pedimental sculptures, but formerly supposed to be parts of minor friezes. Above the pteron rose the pyramid, mounting by 24 steps to an apex or pedestal.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nOn this apex stood the chariot with the figure of Mausolus himself and an attendant. The height of the statue of Mausolus in the [[British Museum]] is 9'9\" without the plinth. The hair falls from the forehead in thick waves on each side of the face and descends nearly to the shoulder; the beard is short and close, the face square and massive, the eyes deep set under overhanging brows, the mouth well formed with settled calm about the lips. The drapery is grandly composed. All sorts of restorations of this famous monument have been proposed. The original one, made by Newton and Pullan, is obviously in error in many respects; and that of Oldfield, though to be preferred for its lightness (the mausoleum was said anciently to be \"suspended in mid-air\"), does not satisfy the conditions postulated by the remains. The best on the whole is that of the veteran German architect, F. Adler, published in 1900; but fresh studies have since been made (see below).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n== Notable people ==\n*[[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia I]] ([[floruit|fl]]. 480 BC), Queen of Halicarnassus, who participated in the [[Battle of Salamis]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrVZAAAAYAAJ&q=Artemisia+I+born+in+Halicarnassus&dq=Artemisia+I+born+in+Halicarnassus |title=Great Lives from History: Aaron-Lysippus |first=Christina A. |last=Salowey |first2=Frank Northen |last2=Magill |publisher=Salem Press |year=2004 |page=109 |isbn=9781587651533}}</ref>\n*[[Herodotus]] (c. 484&nbsp;\u2013 c. 425 BC), Greek historian<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHqsBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA62 |title=Lifelines in World History: The Ancient World, The Medieval World, The Early Modern World, The Modern World |first=Ase |last=Berit |first2=Rolf |last2=Strandskogen |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=26 May 2015 |page=62 |isbn=9781317466048}}</ref>\n*[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] ({{circa|60}} \u2013 8 BC), historian and teacher of rhetoric<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmH697Ke7wQC&pg=PA291 |title=Readings from Classical Rhetoric |first=Patricia P. |last=Matsen |first2=Philip B. |last2=Rollinson |first3=Marion |last3=Sousa |publisher=[[SIU Press]] |year=1990 |page=291 |isbn=9780809315932}}</ref>\n* [[Pigres of Halicarnassus]] - Greek poet\n*[[Aelius Dionysius]] (fl. 2nd century), Greek rhetorician and musician\n* Heraclitus of Halicarnassus - Greek [[Elegiac]] Poet<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg7000.tlg001.perseus-grc2:7.80 Greek Anthology Book 7, 7.80]</ref>\n* [[Hegesippus of Halicarnassus]] - a naval commander of [[Antigonus Monophthalmus]]\n* Scylax of Halicarnassus - ancient [[Ancient Greek astronomy|astronomer]]<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione2.shtml#88 Cicero, On Divination, 2.88]</ref><ref>[https://topostext.org/work/562#2.88 Cicero, On Divination, 2.88 in english]</ref>\n* Cleon of Halicarnassus - ancient orator<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/266#2.212 Plutarch, Laconic Apophthegms, Moralia, 2.212]</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg044.perseus-grc1:20 Plutarch, Life of Agesilaus, 20]</ref>\n* Phormio of Halicarnassus - ancient boxer who was a [[List of ancient Olympic victors|victor]] at the boxing in the 97 [[Ancient Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.21.3 Pausanias, Description of Greece, 5.21.3]</ref>\n* Asiaticus of Halicarnassus - ancient victor at the [[Stadion (running race)|Stadion]] in the 197 Ancient Olympic Games<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/531#79 Eusebius, Chronography, 79]</ref>\n* Julian of Halicarnassus - bishop of Halicarnassus and a leader of the [[Monophysites]] in the 6th century<ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/iota/436 Suda Encyclopedia iota,436]</ref><ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/sigma/271 Suda Encyclopedia, si.271]</ref>\n\n==Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Cook, B.

He embedded four times in Iraq and Afghanistan. His research and reporting from Ramadi, was praised by Gen.

Fumento has lectured throughout the world.<ref name=\"fumento.com\"/>\n\nFumento has been outspoken in his support of adult [[stem cell]] research and critical of embryonic stem cell research, criticizing what he regards as a liberal and corporate bias in favor of the latter.\n\nFor ''Science Under Siege'' he received two awards, including the [[American Council on Science and Health]]'s Distinguished Science Journalist of 1993.\n\n===Debunking crises===\nFumento argues that many reports of threats to society are based on [[junk science|bad science]] and misused statistics. In addition to [[AIDS]], Fumento's writing on science covered such topics as [[global warming]], [[ADHD]], [[obesity]], the health dangers of [[breast implants]], teen drug use, and [[agrarian utopianism]]. He has been highly critical of what he considers extreme [[alarmism]] over such diseases as [[SARS]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/disease/nrosars.html |title=Michael Fumento: Hysteria, Thy Name is SARS<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309003411/http://www.fumento.com/disease/nrosars.html |archive-date=2007-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the potential of a human [[avian flu]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/disease/flu2006.html |title=Michael Fumento: The Chicken Littles Were Wrong |publisher=Fumento.com |accessdate=2012-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327114452/http://www.fumento.com/disease/flu2006.html |archive-date=2013-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA common theme is his claim that many liberal [[environmental groups]] have a hysterical response to most artificial chemicals. He writes that naturally occurring food chemicals are often as toxic as artificial compounds and that there is no scientific reason to view natural compounds as inherently safer. Environmental groups, he holds, willingly accept claims that man-made compounds cause cancer, but gloss over the fact that the toxicity tests often involve quantities millions of times larger than any human being would ever ingest.\n\nSeveral articles deal with the agricultural chemical [[Alar]], banned as a [[carcinogen]] in the United States; Fumento notes that the dosages in one Alar study were the equivalent of almost 30 thousand apples a day for life.<ref>Michael Fumento, \"[http://www.fumento.com/alar1.html The Politics of Cancer Testing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016213053/http://www.fumento.com/alar1.html |date=2005-10-16 }}\", ''[[The American Spectator]]'', August 1990.</ref> In his view, it is impossible to test megadoses of chemicals on mice or rats and extrapolate the results to conclusions about small doses on humans. The statistical nature of these studies, often analyzed by non-statisticians, leaves them vulnerable to extrapolation error. Researchers remain divided on the utility of such tests and on the safety of Alar in particular.\n\nHe has been a frequent critic of activist [[Erin Brockovich]] since her eponymous movie first appeared in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/erinwsj.html |title=Bestselling author and syndicated columnist Michael Fumento reports: \"'Erin Brockovich,' Exposed.\"<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416031457/http://www.fumento.com/erinwsj.html |archive-date=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFumento describes himself as a political conservative.<ref>Michael Fumento, \"[http://www.fumento.com/weblog/archives/2005/07/conservatives_a.html Conservatives and Governments admonitions on Obesity]\", Michael Fumento's weblog, July 15, 2005.</ref> He has drawn criticism from liberal and veterans' activist groups for his views on [[Gulf War Syndrome]], (His ''Reason'' article \"Gulf Lore Syndrome\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/biggulf.html |title=Michael Fumento: Gulf Lore Syndrome<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303054137/http://www.fumento.com/biggulf.html |archive-date=2007-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was a National Magazine Award finalist in 1998<ref>[https://archive.is/20070824210500/http://archives.cjr.org/year/98/nma-1998.asp CJR - 1998 Pulitzer Prize Winners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) and for his writings since 1987<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/comment.html |title=Michael Fumento: AIDS - Are Heterosexuals at Risk?<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302200448/http://www.fumento.com/comment.html |archive-date=2007-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which stated that the threat of [[AIDS]] to the heterosexual population was greatly overstated. He promotes a position of \"[[skepticism]]\" toward claims that man-made chemicals cause cancer in humans.\n\n===Heterosexual AIDS===\nFumento is perhaps best known for his [[epidemiology]] work, especially [[infectious disease]] outbreaks. He argues that the perception of such outbreaks becomes exaggerated or otherwise distorted by those who exploit them to serve various agendas. In November 1987 he published a landmark article, \"AIDS: Are Heterosexuals at Risk?\"<ref>Michael Fumento, \"[http://fumento.com/comment.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901221503/http://www.fumento.com/comment.html |date=2009-09-01 }}\"</ref> in [[Commentary (magazine)|''Commentary'']] that in 1990 became the basis of a controversial book, ''The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS: How a Tragedy Has Been Distorted by the Media and Partisan Politics''.<ref>Michael Fumento, \"[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0895267292 The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS: How a Tragedy Has Been Distorted by the Media and Partisan Politics]\"</ref> He wrote dozens of subsequent pieces on the subject.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/suaids.html |title=Michael Fumento confronts the issues regarding AIDS |publisher=Fumento.com |accessdate=2012-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124025838/http://www.fumento.com/suaids.html |archive-date=2010-01-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In ''Commentary'', he challenged the presumption that, as ''Life'' magazine's July 1985 cover declared in bold red letters, \"Now No One Is Safe from AIDS.\"<ref>Life, July 1985, cover.</ref>\n\nBy 1987 the theme had become common.

In addition to [[AIDS]], Fumento's writing on science covered such topics as [[global warming]], [[ADHD]], [[obesity]], the health dangers of [[breast implants]], teen drug use, and [[agrarian utopianism]]. He has been highly critical of what he considers extreme [[alarmism]] over such diseases as [[SARS]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/disease/nrosars.html |title=Michael Fumento: Hysteria, Thy Name is SARS<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309003411/http://www.fumento.com/disease/nrosars.html |archive-date=2007-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the potential of a human [[avian flu]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/disease/flu2006.html |title=Michael Fumento: The Chicken Littles Were Wrong |publisher=Fumento.com |accessdate=2012-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327114452/http://www.fumento.com/disease/flu2006.html |archive-date=2013-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA common theme is his claim that many liberal [[environmental groups]] have a hysterical response to most artificial chemicals. He writes that naturally occurring food chemicals are often as toxic as artificial compounds and that there is no scientific reason to view natural compounds as inherently safer. Environmental groups, he holds, willingly accept claims that man-made compounds cause cancer, but gloss over the fact that the toxicity tests often involve quantities millions of times larger than any human being would ever ingest.\n\nSeveral articles deal with the agricultural chemical [[Alar]], banned as a [[carcinogen]] in the United States; Fumento notes that the dosages in one Alar study were the equivalent of almost 30 thousand apples a day for life.<ref>Michael Fumento, \"[http://www.fumento.com/alar1.html The Politics of Cancer Testing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016213053/http://www.fumento.com/alar1.html |date=2005-10-16 }}\", ''[[The American Spectator]]'', August 1990.</ref> In his view, it is impossible to test megadoses of chemicals on mice or rats and extrapolate the results to conclusions about small doses on humans. The statistical nature of these studies, often analyzed by non-statisticians, leaves them vulnerable to extrapolation error. Researchers remain divided on the utility of such tests and on the safety of Alar in particular.\n\nHe has been a frequent critic of activist [[Erin Brockovich]] since her eponymous movie first appeared in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/erinwsj.html |title=Bestselling author and syndicated columnist Michael Fumento reports: \"'Erin Brockovich,' Exposed.\"<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416031457/http://www.fumento.com/erinwsj.html |archive-date=2007-04-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFumento describes himself as a political conservative.<ref>Michael Fumento, \"[http://www.fumento.com/weblog/archives/2005/07/conservatives_a.html Conservatives and Governments admonitions on Obesity]\", Michael Fumento's weblog, July 15, 2005.</ref> He has drawn criticism from liberal and veterans' activist groups for his views on [[Gulf War Syndrome]], (His ''Reason'' article \"Gulf Lore Syndrome\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/biggulf.html |title=Michael Fumento: Gulf Lore Syndrome<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303054137/http://www.fumento.com/biggulf.html |archive-date=2007-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was a National Magazine Award finalist in 1998<ref>[https://archive.is/20070824210500/http://archives.cjr.org/year/98/nma-1998.asp CJR - 1998 Pulitzer Prize Winners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) and for his writings since 1987<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fumento.com/comment.html |title=Michael Fumento: AIDS - Are Heterosexuals at Risk?<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302200448/http://www.fumento.com/comment.html |archive-date=2007-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which stated that the threat of [[AIDS]] to the heterosexual population was greatly overstated. He promotes a position of \"[[skepticism]]\" toward claims that man-made chemicals cause cancer in humans.\n\n===Heterosexual AIDS===\nFumento is perhaps best known for his [[epidemiology]] work, especially [[infectious disease]] outbreaks. He argues that the perception of such outbreaks becomes exaggerated or otherwise distorted by those who exploit them to serve various agendas.

He gave the example of [[The Heartland Institute]] billboards, comparing believers in global warming to [[Ted Kaczynski]]. This, Fumento said, was the same kind of \"mass hysteria\" that he rejected in the claims for a heterosexual AIDS epidemic and a swine flu pandemic. \"The last thing hysteria promoters want is calm, reasoned argument backed by facts. And I'm horrified that these people have co-opted the name 'conservative' to scream their messages of hate and anger,\" Fumento said.<ref name=\"Salon\">[http://www.salon.com/2012/05/24/my_break_with_the_extreme_right/ My break with the extreme right: I worked for Reagan and wrote for National Review.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned to team with [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania''. However, Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs - a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half-empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned to team with [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania''. However, Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs - a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half-empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critic and audience reception was mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout!

The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

Since August 2019<!--(or: \u201cas of September 2019\u201d?)-->, only the latter archival method is available.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Browsable legacy Twitter archive format ====\nIn December 2012, Twitter introduced a \u201cTweet archival\u201d feature,<ref name=\"archive2012\">[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/a/2012/your-twitter-archive.html Blog.Twitter.com article ''\u201cYour Twitter archive\u201d'']</ref> which created a [[ZIP file]] that contains an offline-browsable archive of all tweets.\n\nThose exported tweets could be browsed and searched offline by using the bundled user-interface accessible through an [[Internet browser]], which used [[Pagination#In web browsers|client-side, JavaScript-powered pagination]].<ref name=\"archivebrowser\">[https://searchengineland.com/finally-you-can-search-all-your-tweets-via-twitter-142985 2012 SearchEngineLand article on browsing tweets offline.]</ref>\n\nThe user interface of the tweet archive browser had a design similar to Twitter's 2010\u20132014 desktop user interface, even until the feature's removal.\n\nThe tweet text contents, ID's, time data and source labels are located in the file called \u201c<code>tweets.csv</code>\u201d.\n\nThe ability to export this type of tweet archive, which never existed on [[#Twitter Lite|the new layout]], has been removed entirely in August 2019<sup>[when exactly?]</sup>, after co-existing with the new 2018 data archival method.\nEven when accessing the legacy Twitter desktop website layout using the user-agent of an older browser version, the option has disappeared from the account settings.\n\nIt was possible to request at least 1 archive per day{{please verify|date=September 2019}}<!--how much exactly?-->.\n\n==== New machine-readable archive format ====\nDue to the [[european law|legal]] [[GDPR]] \u00a720 obligation (effective since May 2018) to provide [[data portability]], social media services had to introduce advanced data export <!-- download, backup --> capabilities and utilities.\n\nThe original browsable tweet archives did lack a lot of metadata, especially about the account itself, which the new machine-readable archival feature does contain:\n* Account ID and creation date\n* Direct messages\n* List of:\n** Following users + count\n** Followed users + count\n** Blocked user IDs\n** Muted user IDs\n** Liked tweets\n* Twitter ''Moments''\n* Information about ''[[Periscope]]'' account\n* Saved searches\n* Screen name changes\n* Associated mobile phone number\n* Various account settings\n* Users in created ''Twitter Lists''\n* Member of which ''Twitter Lists''\n* Advanced tweet [[metadata]] (e.g. ''tweet source tag'')\n* More\u2026\n<!-- Are image descriptions also included? -->\n<!-- Pending follow requests to private accounts? -->\n\nThe tweet contents are located in the file called \u201c<code>tweet.js</code>\u201d.\n\nHowever, this new archival format contains all uploaded multimedia in the highest resolution, which makes its [[file size]] usually multiple times as large.\n\nAdditionally, the integrated tweet browser from the legacy archival feature is not bundled.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that one can '''only generate one of these archives per 30 days.'''\nAfter obtaining this archive, one has to wait 30 days until requesting the next archive is possible. During that timespan, the previous archive remains downloadable from the account settings.\n\nThis feature co-existed with the original browsable tweet archival feature since early 2018, until the latter was removed in August 2019.\n\n==Usage==\nIn mid-September 2019, Twitter was ranked the 32nd most visited website globally by [[Alexa Internet|Alexa's]] [[web traffic]] analysis, down from twelfth in March 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitter.com|title=Twitter.com|last=|first=|date=March 23, 2018|website=|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>Alexa topsites.

The study also looked at the media response to the tweets during the election.

Since August 2019<!--(or: \u201cas of September 2019\u201d?)-->, only the latter archival method is available.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Browsable legacy Twitter archive format ====\nIn December 2012, Twitter introduced a \u201cTweet archival\u201d feature,<ref name=\"archive2012\">[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/a/2012/your-twitter-archive.html Blog.Twitter.com article ''\u201cYour Twitter archive\u201d'']</ref> which created a [[ZIP file]] that contains an offline-browsable archive of all tweets.\n\nThose exported tweets could be browsed and searched offline by using the bundled user-interface accessible through an [[Internet browser]], which used [[Pagination#In web browsers|client-side, JavaScript-powered pagination]].<ref name=\"archivebrowser\">[https://searchengineland.com/finally-you-can-search-all-your-tweets-via-twitter-142985 2012 SearchEngineLand article on browsing tweets offline.]</ref>\n\nThe user interface of the tweet archive browser had a design similar to Twitter's 2010\u20132014 desktop user interface, even until the feature's removal.\n\nThe tweet text contents, ID's, time data and source labels are located in the file called \u201c<code>tweets.csv</code>\u201d.\n\nThe ability to export this type of tweet archive, which never existed on [[#Twitter Lite|the new layout]], has been removed entirely in August 2019<sup>[when exactly?]</sup>, after co-existing with the new 2018 data archival method.\nEven when accessing the legacy Twitter desktop website layout using the user-agent of an older browser version, the option has disappeared from the account settings.\n\nIt was possible to request at least 1 archive per day{{please verify|date=September 2019}}<!--how much exactly?-->.\n\n==== New machine-readable archive format ====\nDue to the [[european law|legal]] [[GDPR]] \u00a720 obligation (effective since May 2018) to provide [[data portability]], social media services had to introduce advanced data export <!-- download, backup --> capabilities and utilities.\n\nThe original browsable tweet archives did lack a lot of metadata, especially about the account itself, which the new machine-readable archival feature does contain:\n* Account ID and creation date\n* Direct messages\n* List of:\n** Following users + count\n** Followed users + count\n** Blocked user IDs\n** Muted user IDs\n** Liked tweets\n* Twitter ''Moments''\n* Information about ''[[Periscope]]'' account\n* Saved searches\n* Screen name changes\n* Associated mobile phone number\n* Various account settings\n* Users in created ''Twitter Lists''\n* Member of which ''Twitter Lists''\n* Advanced tweet [[metadata]] (e.g. ''tweet source tag'')\n* More\u2026\n<!-- Are image descriptions also included? -->\n<!-- Pending follow requests to private accounts? -->\n\nThe tweet contents are located in the file called \u201c<code>tweet.js</code>\u201d.\n\nHowever, this new archival format contains all uploaded multimedia in the highest resolution, which makes its [[file size]] usually multiple times as large.\n\nAdditionally, the integrated tweet browser from the legacy archival feature is not bundled.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that one can '''only generate one of these archives per 30 days.'''\nAfter obtaining this archive, one has to wait 30 days until requesting the next archive is possible. During that timespan, the previous archive remains downloadable from the account settings.\n\nThis feature co-existed with the original browsable tweet archival feature since early 2018, until the latter was removed in August 2019.\n\n==Usage==\nIn mid-September 2019, Twitter was ranked the 32nd most visited website globally by [[Alexa Internet|Alexa's]] [[web traffic]] analysis, down from twelfth in March 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitter.com|title=Twitter.com|last=|first=|date=March 23, 2018|website=|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>Alexa topsites.

The study also looked at the media response to the tweets during the election.

Although in theory the result should be unambiguous, in practice given the large number of languages there are numerous disagreements, with various scholars differing significantly on the number and nature of the phonemes in Proto-Austronesian.  In the past, some disagreements concerned whether certain correspondence sets were real or represent sporadic developments in particular languages.  For the currently remaining disagreements, however, scholars generally accept the validity of the correspondence sets but disagree on the extent to which the distinctions in these sets can be projected back to proto-Austronesian or represent innovations in particular sets of daughter languages.\n\n===Blust's reconstruction===\nBelow are Proto-Austronesian [[phoneme]]s reconstructed by [[Robert Blust]], a professor of linguistics at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].<ref name=\"Blust09\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Blust|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Blust|author2=Australian National University.

There is some disagreement about the postvelars (q \u0294 h) and the velars g j, and about whether there are any more diphthongs; however, in these respects, Ross and Blust are in agreement. The major disagreement concerns the system of [[coronal consonant]]s.  The following discussion is based on Ross (1992).<ref name=\"ross\"/>\n\n[[Otto Dempwolff]]'s reconstruction of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian from the 1930s included:\n*Dental t d n l\n*Retroflex \u1e6d \u1e0d \u1e37\n*Palatal t' d' n'\n*Palatal k' g'\n\nDyen (1963), including data from the Formosan languages, expanded Dempwolff's set of coronal consonants: \n*t split into t and C\n*n split into n and L/N\n*d' split and renotated as z and Z\n*t' split into s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub>\n*\u1e37 \u1e6d \u1e0d n' k' g' h renotated as r T D \u00f1 c j q\n\nTsuchida (1976), building on Dyen's system:\n*Further split d into D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> D<sub>4</sub>. He also believed that Dyen's c (Dempwolff's k') could not be reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian (he also split Dyen's w into w W and q into q Q, which were not accepted by later scholars.)\n\n[[Otto Christian Dahl|Dahl]] reduced Tsuchida's consonants into:\n*D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> D<sub>4</sub> into d<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>3</sub> (with the new d<sub>3</sub> reflecting the combination of the old D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>4</sub>) and combined Dyen's S X x into a single phoneme S.  He did accept Dyen's c but did not accept his T D. (He also renotated a number of phonemes in ways that were not generally accepted by later scholars.)\n\nBlust based his system on a combination of Dyen, Tsuchida and Dahl, and attempted to reduce the total number of phonemes. He accepted Dahl's reduction of Dyen's S X x into S but did not accept either Tsuchida's or Dahl's split of Dyen's d; in addition, he reduced Dyen's s<sub>1</sub> s<sub>2</sub> to a single phoneme s. While accepting Dyen's c, he was hesitant about T and D (more recently, Blust appears to have accepted D but rejected T, and also rejected Z).\n\nRoss likewise attempted to reduce the number of phonemes, but in a different way:\n*He accepts Dahl's d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> and also Z (eventually rejected by Blust).  He notes that the distinction between d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> is only reconstructable for the Formosan language groups [[Amis language|Amis]], Proto-Puyuma and Proto-Paiwan, and only Proto-Paiwan has a three-way distinction among d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub>; contrarily the distinction between Z and d<sub>1</sub> is reconstructable only for Proto-Rukai and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, but not any of the previous three groups.  However, he still believes (contra Blust) that the distinction among these phonemes is an inheritance from Proto-Austronesian rather than an innovation in the respective groups.\n*He notes that d<sub>1</sub> occurs only morpheme-initially, while r occurs only morpheme-non-initially, and as a result combines the two.\n*He does not accept the phonemes c z \u00f1 in Proto-Austronesian, and asserts that none of them are \"readily reconstructable\" outside of [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]]. Furthermore, while he believes that \u00f1 was a general innovation in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, c and z \"are reflected differently from PMP [Proto-Malayo-Polynesian] *s and *d only in a fairly limited area of western Indo-Malaysia and appear to be the results of local developments\".\n*He also reconstructs the coronals somewhat differently. He believes that C S l d<sub>3</sub> were all retroflex (respectively, {{IPA|/t\u0282/; /\u0282/ or /\u0283/; /\u026d/ or /\u027d/; /\u0256/}}), and s and L (Blust's N) were dental /s/ and /l/, as opposed to Blust's reconstruction as dental and palatal, respectively. According to Ross, this is based on their outcomes in the [[Formosan languages]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]; although their outcomes as dental/palatal is geographically more distributed, it occurs only in [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], which represent a single clade with respect to the Formosan languages.\n\n==Sound changes==\n{{see also|Formosan languages#Sound changes}}\nAs Proto-Austronesian transitioned to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], and [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]], the phonemic inventories were continually reduced by merging formerly distinct sounds into one sound. Three mergers were observed in the Proto-Austronesian to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian transition, while nine were observed for the Proto-Oceanic to Proto-Polynesian transition. Thus, Proto-Austronesian has the most elaborate sound system, while Proto-Polynesian has the fewest phonemes. For instance, the [[Hawaiian language]] is famous for having only eight consonants, while [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] has only ten consonants. This is a sharp reduction from the 25 consonants of the Proto-Austronesian language that was originally spoken near Taiwan or [[Kinmen]].\n\nBlust also observed the following mergers and sound changes between Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian.<ref name=\"Blust09\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Proto-Austronesian and<br>Proto-Malayo-Polynesian Sound Changes\n!c=02| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=03| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=02| *C/t\n|c=03| *t\n|-\n|c=02| *N/n\n|c=03| *n\n|-\n|c=02| *S/h\n|c=03| *h\n|-\n|c=02| *eS<ref>Technically this is still part of the *S > *h sound change.

[[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]], or verb-final, word order is considered to be typologically unusual for Austronesian languages, and is only found in various Austronesian languages of [[New Guinea]] and to a more limited extent, the [[Solomon Islands]]. This is because SOV word order is very common in the non-Austronesian [[Papuan languages]].\n\n===Voice system===\nThe Austronesian languages of [[Taiwan]], [[Borneo]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Philippines]] are also well known for their unusual [[morphosyntactic alignment]], which is known as the [[Austronesian alignment]]. This alignment was also present in the Proto-Austronesian language. Unlike Proto-Austronesian, however, Proto-Oceanic syntax does not make use of the focus morphology present in Austronesian-aligned languages such as the [[Philippine languages]]. In the [[Polynesian languages]], verbal morphology is relatively simple, while the main unit in a sentence is the phrase rather than the word.\n\nBelow is a table of John Wolff's Proto-Austronesian voice system from Blust (2009:433).

For instance, *pa- was used for non-stative (i.e., dynamic) causatives, while *pa-ka was used for stative causatives (Blust 2009:282). Blust also noted a p/m pairing phenomenon in which many affixes have both ''p-'' and ''m-'' forms. This system is especially elaborate in the [[Thao language]] of Taiwan.<ref name=\"Blust09\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto:\" width=\"50%\"\n|+Proto-Austronesian Affixes\n!c=01| Affix\n!c=02| Gloss\n|-\n|c=01| *ka-\n|c=02| [[inchoative]] (Formosan only), [[stative]], past time, accompanied action/person, abstract noun formative, manner in which an action is carried out, past participle\n|-\n|c=01| *ma-\n|c=02| stative\n|-\n|c=01| *maka-\n|c=02| abilitative/aptative\n|-\n|c=01| *maki/paki\n|c=02| petitive (petitioning for something)<ref>Only found in the central and southern Philippines as well as some parts of Borneo and Sulawesi.</ref>\n|-\n|c=01| *ma\u014b\n|c=02| actor voice\n|-\n|c=01| *pa\u014b\n|c=02| instrumental voice\n|-\n|c=01| *ma\u0280-\n|c=02| actor voice\n|-\n|c=01| *pa\u0280-\n|c=02| instrumental noun\n|-\n|c=01| *mu-\n|c=02| movement<ref>Found in the Formosan languages and possibly also in Cebuano.</ref>\n|-\n|c=01| *pa(-ka-)\n|c=02| causative\n|-\n|c=01| *pa\u0280i-\n|c=02| reciprocal/collective action<ref>Often found in [[Oceanic languages]].</ref>\n|-\n|c=01| *qali/kali-\n|c=02| sensitive connection with the spirit world<ref>Used with insects, rainbows, storm/natural phenomena, various plant/animal names, etc.</ref>\n|-\n|c=01| *Sa-\n|c=02| instrumental voice\n|-\n|c=01| *Si-\n|c=02| instrumental voice\n|-\n|c=01| *-an\n|c=02| instrumental voice: imperative\n|-\n|c=01| *Sika-\n|c=02| ordinal numeral\n|-\n|c=01| *ta(\u0280-)\n|c=02| sudden, unexpected, or accidental action\n|-\n|c=01| *-um-\n|c=02| actor voice: transitivity, etc.\n|-\n|c=01| *-in-\n|c=02| perfective, nominalizer\n|-\n|c=01| *-ar-\n|c=02| plural\n|-\n|c=01| *-an\n|c=02| locative voice\n|-\n|c=01| *-i\n|c=02| locative voice: imperative\n|-\n|c=01| *-en\n|c=02| patient voice\n|-\n|c=01| *-a\n|c=02| patient voice: imperative\n|-\n|c=01| *-ay\n|c=02| future\n|-\n|c=01| *ka- -an\n|c=02| adversative passive, abstract nouns\n|}\n\n===Reduplication===\nCV (consonant + vowel) [[reduplication]] is very common among the Austronesian languages. In Proto-Austronesian, Ca-reduplicated (consonant + /a/) numbers were used to count humans, while the non-reduplicated sets were used to count non-human and inanimate objects. CV-reduplication was also used to nominalize verbs in Proto-Austronesian. In Ilocano, CV-reduplication is used to pluralize nouns.\n\n[[Reduplication]] patterns include (Blust 2009):\n\n*Full reduplication\n*Full reduplication plus affixation\n*Full reduplication minus the coda\n*Full reduplication minus the last vowel\n*Full reduplication with vocalic or consonantal change, or both\n*Full reduplication with consecutive identical syllables\n*Prefixal foot reduplication/leftward reduplication\n*Suffixal foot reduplication/rightward reduplication\n*CVC-reduplication\n*CV-reduplication (marks durative aspect, collectivity, or intensity in Bunun; future in Tagalog)\n*CV-reduplication plus affixation\n*Ca-reduplication (used to derive human-counting numerals and deverbal instrumental nouns in Thao and Puyuma)\n*Extensions of fixed segmentism\n*Reduplicative infixes\n*Suffixal syllable reduplication\n\nOther less common patterns are (Blust 2009):\n*Vacuous reduplication (occurs in Paamese)\n*Full reduplication minus the initial (occurs in Anejom of southern Vanuatu)\n*Full reduplication plus an initial glide (occurs in Kosraean)\n*Partial reduplication minus initial glottal stop (occurs in Rennellese)\n*True CV-reduplication (occurs in Pangasinan)\n*Rightward trisyllabic reduplication (occurs in the [[Manam language]])\n*Double reduplication (occurs in Woleaian)\n*Triplication (only in the [[Thao language]])\n*Serial reduplication (only in the [[Thao language]])\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n===Pronouns===\n{{See also|Austronesian personal pronouns}}\nThe Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian [[personal pronoun]]s below were reconstructed by [[Robert Blust]].<ref name=\"Blust09\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian Pronouns\n!c=01| Type of Pronoun\n!c=02| English\n!c=03| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=04| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=01| 1s.\n|c=02| \"I\"\n|c=03| *i-aku\n|c=04| *i-aku\n|-\n|c=01| 2s.\n|c=02| \"you/thou\"\n|c=03| *i-(ka)Su\n|c=04| *i-kahu\n|-\n|c=01| 3s.\n|c=02| \"he/she/it\"\n|c=03| *si-ia\n|c=04| *si-ia\n|-\n|c=01| 1p.

The cardinal directions of north, south, east, and west developed among the Austronesian languages only after contact with the Europeans. For the land-sea axis, upstream/uphill and inland, as well as downstream/downhill and seaward, are synonym pairs. This has been proposed as evidence that Proto-Austronesians used to live on a mainland, since the sea would be visible from all angles on small islands.<ref name=\"Blust09\"/>\n\n* *daya: inland (also upstream/uphill)\n* *lahud: seaward (also downstream/downhill)\n* *SabaRat: west monsoon\n* *timuR: east monsoon\n* *qamiS: north wind\n\nIn Kavalan, Amis, and Tagalog, the reflexes of *timuR mean \"south\" or \"south wind,\" while in the languages of the southern Philippines and Indonesia it means \"east\" or \"east wind.\"\n\nIn [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], {{lang|ilo|d\u00e1ya}} and {{lang|ilo|l\u00e1ud}} respectively mean \"east\" and \"west,\" while in [[Puyuma language|Puyuma]], {{lang|pyu|\u0256aya}} and {{lang|pyu|\u026dau\u0256}} respectively mean \"west\" and \"east.\"<ref>Cauquelin, Josiane. 1991.

Among the Bontok, Kankanaey, and Ifugaw languages of northern Luzon, the reflexes of *daya mean \"sky\" due to the fact that they already live in some of the highest elevations in the Philippines (Blust 2009:301).\n\nAlso, the [[Malay language|Malay]] reflex of *lahud is {{lang|ms|laut}}, which means \"sea\", used as directions {{lang|ms|timur laut}} (means \"northeast\", ''timur'' = \"east\") and {{lang|ms|barat laut}} (means \"northwest\", ''barat'' = \"west\"). Meanwhile, *daya only performs in {{lang|ms|barat daya}}, which means \"southwest\".\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] reflex of *lahud, {{lang|jv|lor}}, means \"north\" since the [[Java Sea]] is located to the north of the island of [[Java]].\n\n===Numerals===\nBelow are reconstructed Proto-Austronesian, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, Proto-Oceanic, and Proto-Polynesian numbers from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database.<ref>[http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/ Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Numerals\n!c=01| Number\n!c=02| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=03| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n!c=04| Proto-Oceanic\n!c=05| Proto-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=01| one\n|c=02| *esa, *isa\n|c=03| *esa, *isa\n|c=04| *sa-kai, *ta-sa, *tai, *kai\n|c=05| *taha\n|-\n|c=01| two\n|c=02| *duSa\n|c=03| *duha\n|c=04| *rua\n|c=05| *rua\n|-\n|c=01| three\n|c=02| *telu\n|c=03| *telu\n|c=04| *tolu\n|c=05| *tolu\n|-\n|c=01| four\n|c=02| *Sepat\n|c=03| *epat\n|c=04| *pat, *pati, *pani\n|c=05| *faa\n|-\n|c=01| five\n|c=02| *lima\n|c=03| *lima\n|c=04| *lima\n|c=05| *lima\n|}\n\nThe Proto-Austronesian language had different sets of numerals for non-humans (\"set A\") and humans (\"set B\") (Blust 2009:279). Cardinal numerals for counting humans are derived from the non-human numerals through Ca-reduplication. This bipartite numeral system is found in Thao, Puyuma, Yami, Chamorro, and various other languages (however, Paiwan uses {{lang|pwn|ma-}} and {{lang|pwn|man\u0259-}} to derive human numerals). In many Philippine languages such as Tagalog, the two numeral systems are merged (Blust 2009:280-281).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Basic numerals vs. human numerals\n!c=01| Number\n!c=02| Set A\n!c=03| Set B\n!c=04| Tagalog\n|-\n|c=01| one\n|c=02| *isa\n|c=03| *?\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|isa}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| two\n|c=02| *duSa\n|c=03| *da-duSa\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|dalawa}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| three\n|c=02| *telu\n|c=03| *ta-telu\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|tatlo}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| four\n|c=02| *Sepat\n|c=03| *Sa-Sepat\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|apat}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| five\n|c=02| *lima\n|c=03| *la-lima\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|lima}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| six\n|c=02| *enem\n|c=03| *a-enem\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|anim}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| seven\n|c=02| *pitu\n|c=03| *pa-pitu\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|pito}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| eight\n|c=02| *walu\n|c=03| *wa-walu\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|walo}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| nine\n|c=02| *Siwa\n|c=03| *Sa-Siwa\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|(siyam)}}\n|-\n|c=01| ten\n|c=02| *sa-puluq\n|c=03| *?\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|sampu}}\n|}\n\nProto-Austronesian also used *Sika- to derive [[ordinal numerals]] (Blust 2009:281).\n\n===Verbs===\nBelow are reconstructed Proto-Austronesian, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, Proto-Oceanic, and Proto-Polynesian verbs from the [http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/ Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Verbs\n!c=01| Verb\n!c=02| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=03| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n!c=04| Proto-Oceanic\n!c=05| Proto-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=01| to walk\n|c=02| *Nakaw\n|c=03| *lakaw, paNaw\n|c=04| *lako, pano\n|c=05| *fano\n|-\n|c=01| to swim\n|c=02| *Na\u014buy\n|c=03| *na\u014buy\n|c=04| *kakaRu\n|c=05| *kaukau\n|-\n|c=01| to know\n|c=02| *bajaq\n|c=03| *taqu\n|c=04| *taqu\n|c=05| *qiloa\n|-\n|c=01| to think\n|c=02| *nemnem\n|c=03| *demdem\n|c=04| *rodrom\n|c=05| *manatu\n|-\n|c=01| to sleep\n|c=02| *tuduR\n|c=03| *tuduR\n|c=04| *turuR\n|c=05| *mohe\n|-\n|c=01| to stand\n|c=02| *diRi\n|c=03| *diRi, *tuqud\n|c=04| *tuqur\n|c=05| *tuqu\n|-\n|c=01| to sew\n|c=02| *taSiq\n|c=03| *tahiq, *zaqit\n|c=04| *saqit, *turi\n|c=05| *tui\n|-\n|c=01| to die, be dead\n|c=02| *m-aCay\n|c=03| *m-atay\n|c=04| *mate\n|c=05| *mate\n|-\n|c=01| to choose\n|c=02| *piliq\n|c=03| *piliq\n|c=04| *piliq\n|c=05| *fili\n|-\n|c=01| to fly\n|c=02| *layap\n|c=03| *layap, Rebek\n|c=04| *Ropok\n|c=05| *lele\n|}\n\n==Monosyllabic roots==\nThe following are monosyllabic Proto-Austronesian roots reconstructed by John Wolff (Wolff 1999).<ref>Wolff, John. 1999. \"The monosyllabic roots of Proto-Austronesian.\" In Elizabeth Zeitoun and Paul Jen-kuei Li, eds. 1999.

Although in theory the result should be unambiguous, in practice given the large number of languages there are numerous disagreements, with various scholars differing significantly on the number and nature of the phonemes in Proto-Austronesian.  In the past, some disagreements concerned whether certain correspondence sets were real or represent sporadic developments in particular languages.

There is some disagreement about the postvelars (q \u0294 h) and the velars g j, and about whether there are any more diphthongs; however, in these respects, Ross and Blust are in agreement. The major disagreement concerns the system of [[coronal consonant]]s.  The following discussion is based on Ross (1992).<ref name=\"ross\"/>\n\n[[Otto Dempwolff]]'s reconstruction of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian from the 1930s included:\n*Dental t d n l\n*Retroflex \u1e6d \u1e0d \u1e37\n*Palatal t' d' n'\n*Palatal k' g'\n\nDyen (1963), including data from the Formosan languages, expanded Dempwolff's set of coronal consonants: \n*t split into t and C\n*n split into n and L/N\n*d' split and renotated as z and Z\n*t' split into s<sub>1</sub> and s<sub>2</sub>\n*\u1e37 \u1e6d \u1e0d n' k' g' h renotated as r T D \u00f1 c j q\n\nTsuchida (1976), building on Dyen's system:\n*Further split d into D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> D<sub>4</sub>. He also believed that Dyen's c (Dempwolff's k') could not be reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian (he also split Dyen's w into w W and q into q Q, which were not accepted by later scholars.)\n\n[[Otto Christian Dahl|Dahl]] reduced Tsuchida's consonants into:\n*D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> D<sub>4</sub> into d<sub>3</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>3</sub> (with the new d<sub>3</sub> reflecting the combination of the old D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>4</sub>) and combined Dyen's S X x into a single phoneme S.  He did accept Dyen's c but did not accept his T D. (He also renotated a number of phonemes in ways that were not generally accepted by later scholars.)\n\nBlust based his system on a combination of Dyen, Tsuchida and Dahl, and attempted to reduce the total number of phonemes. He accepted Dahl's reduction of Dyen's S X x into S but did not accept either Tsuchida's or Dahl's split of Dyen's d; in addition, he reduced Dyen's s<sub>1</sub> s<sub>2</sub> to a single phoneme s. While accepting Dyen's c, he was hesitant about T and D (more recently, Blust appears to have accepted D but rejected T, and also rejected Z).\n\nRoss likewise attempted to reduce the number of phonemes, but in a different way:\n*He accepts Dahl's d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> and also Z (eventually rejected by Blust).  He notes that the distinction between d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> is only reconstructable for the Formosan language groups [[Amis language|Amis]], Proto-Puyuma and Proto-Paiwan, and only Proto-Paiwan has a three-way distinction among d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub>; contrarily the distinction between Z and d<sub>1</sub> is reconstructable only for Proto-Rukai and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, but not any of the previous three groups.  However, he still believes (contra Blust) that the distinction among these phonemes is an inheritance from Proto-Austronesian rather than an innovation in the respective groups.\n*He notes that d<sub>1</sub> occurs only morpheme-initially, while r occurs only morpheme-non-initially, and as a result combines the two.\n*He does not accept the phonemes c z \u00f1 in Proto-Austronesian, and asserts that none of them are \"readily reconstructable\" outside of [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]]. Furthermore, while he believes that \u00f1 was a general innovation in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, c and z \"are reflected differently from PMP [Proto-Malayo-Polynesian] *s and *d only in a fairly limited area of western Indo-Malaysia and appear to be the results of local developments\".\n*He also reconstructs the coronals somewhat differently. He believes that C S l d<sub>3</sub> were all retroflex (respectively, {{IPA|/t\u0282/; /\u0282/ or /\u0283/; /\u026d/ or /\u027d/; /\u0256/}}), and s and L (Blust's N) were dental /s/ and /l/, as opposed to Blust's reconstruction as dental and palatal, respectively. According to Ross, this is based on their outcomes in the [[Formosan languages]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]; although their outcomes as dental/palatal is geographically more distributed, it occurs only in [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], which represent a single clade with respect to the Formosan languages.\n\n==Sound changes==\n{{see also|Formosan languages#Sound changes}}\nAs Proto-Austronesian transitioned to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], and [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]], the phonemic inventories were continually reduced by merging formerly distinct sounds into one sound. Three mergers were observed in the Proto-Austronesian to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian transition, while nine were observed for the Proto-Oceanic to Proto-Polynesian transition. Thus, Proto-Austronesian has the most elaborate sound system, while Proto-Polynesian has the fewest phonemes. For instance, the [[Hawaiian language]] is famous for having only eight consonants, while [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] has only ten consonants. This is a sharp reduction from the 25 consonants of the Proto-Austronesian language that was originally spoken near Taiwan or [[Kinmen]].\n\nBlust also observed the following mergers and sound changes between Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian.<ref name=\"Blust09\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Proto-Austronesian and<br>Proto-Malayo-Polynesian Sound Changes\n!c=02| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=03| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=02| *C/t\n|c=03| *t\n|-\n|c=02| *N/n\n|c=03| *n\n|-\n|c=02| *S/h\n|c=03| *h\n|-\n|c=02| *eS<ref>Technically this is still part of the *S > *h sound change.

[[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]], or verb-final, word order is considered to be typologically unusual for Austronesian languages, and is only found in various Austronesian languages of [[New Guinea]] and to a more limited extent, the [[Solomon Islands]]. This is because SOV word order is very common in the non-Austronesian [[Papuan languages]].\n\n===Voice system===\nThe Austronesian languages of [[Taiwan]], [[Borneo]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Philippines]] are also well known for their unusual [[morphosyntactic alignment]], which is known as the [[Austronesian alignment]]. This alignment was also present in the Proto-Austronesian language. Unlike Proto-Austronesian, however, Proto-Oceanic syntax does not make use of the focus morphology present in Austronesian-aligned languages such as the [[Philippine languages]]. In the [[Polynesian languages]], verbal morphology is relatively simple, while the main unit in a sentence is the phrase rather than the word.\n\nBelow is a table of John Wolff's Proto-Austronesian voice system from Blust (2009:433).

For instance, *pa- was used for non-stative (i.e., dynamic) causatives, while *pa-ka was used for stative causatives (Blust 2009:282). Blust also noted a p/m pairing phenomenon in which many affixes have both ''p-'' and ''m-'' forms.

In Proto-Austronesian, Ca-reduplicated (consonant + /a/) numbers were used to count humans, while the non-reduplicated sets were used to count non-human and inanimate objects. CV-reduplication was also used to nominalize verbs in Proto-Austronesian. In Ilocano, CV-reduplication is used to pluralize nouns.\n\n[[Reduplication]] patterns include (Blust 2009):\n\n*Full reduplication\n*Full reduplication plus affixation\n*Full reduplication minus the coda\n*Full reduplication minus the last vowel\n*Full reduplication with vocalic or consonantal change, or both\n*Full reduplication with consecutive identical syllables\n*Prefixal foot reduplication/leftward reduplication\n*Suffixal foot reduplication/rightward reduplication\n*CVC-reduplication\n*CV-reduplication (marks durative aspect, collectivity, or intensity in Bunun; future in Tagalog)\n*CV-reduplication plus affixation\n*Ca-reduplication (used to derive human-counting numerals and deverbal instrumental nouns in Thao and Puyuma)\n*Extensions of fixed segmentism\n*Reduplicative infixes\n*Suffixal syllable reduplication\n\nOther less common patterns are (Blust 2009):\n*Vacuous reduplication (occurs in Paamese)\n*Full reduplication minus the initial (occurs in Anejom of southern Vanuatu)\n*Full reduplication plus an initial glide (occurs in Kosraean)\n*Partial reduplication minus initial glottal stop (occurs in Rennellese)\n*True CV-reduplication (occurs in Pangasinan)\n*Rightward trisyllabic reduplication (occurs in the [[Manam language]])\n*Double reduplication (occurs in Woleaian)\n*Triplication (only in the [[Thao language]])\n*Serial reduplication (only in the [[Thao language]])\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n===Pronouns===\n{{See also|Austronesian personal pronouns}}\nThe Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian [[personal pronoun]]s below were reconstructed by [[Robert Blust]].<ref name=\"Blust09\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian Pronouns\n!c=01| Type of Pronoun\n!c=02| English\n!c=03| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=04| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=01| 1s.\n|c=02| \"I\"\n|c=03| *i-aku\n|c=04| *i-aku\n|-\n|c=01| 2s.\n|c=02| \"you/thou\"\n|c=03| *i-(ka)Su\n|c=04| *i-kahu\n|-\n|c=01| 3s.\n|c=02| \"he/she/it\"\n|c=03| *si-ia\n|c=04| *si-ia\n|-\n|c=01| 1p.

The cardinal directions of north, south, east, and west developed among the Austronesian languages only after contact with the Europeans. For the land-sea axis, upstream/uphill and inland, as well as downstream/downhill and seaward, are synonym pairs. This has been proposed as evidence that Proto-Austronesians used to live on a mainland, since the sea would be visible from all angles on small islands.<ref name=\"Blust09\"/>\n\n* *daya: inland (also upstream/uphill)\n* *lahud: seaward (also downstream/downhill)\n* *SabaRat: west monsoon\n* *timuR: east monsoon\n* *qamiS: north wind\n\nIn Kavalan, Amis, and Tagalog, the reflexes of *timuR mean \"south\" or \"south wind,\" while in the languages of the southern Philippines and Indonesia it means \"east\" or \"east wind.\"\n\nIn [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], {{lang|ilo|d\u00e1ya}} and {{lang|ilo|l\u00e1ud}} respectively mean \"east\" and \"west,\" while in [[Puyuma language|Puyuma]], {{lang|pyu|\u0256aya}} and {{lang|pyu|\u026dau\u0256}} respectively mean \"west\" and \"east.\"<ref>Cauquelin, Josiane. 1991.

Among the Bontok, Kankanaey, and Ifugaw languages of northern Luzon, the reflexes of *daya mean \"sky\" due to the fact that they already live in some of the highest elevations in the Philippines (Blust 2009:301).\n\nAlso, the [[Malay language|Malay]] reflex of *lahud is {{lang|ms|laut}}, which means \"sea\", used as directions {{lang|ms|timur laut}} (means \"northeast\", ''timur'' = \"east\") and {{lang|ms|barat laut}} (means \"northwest\", ''barat'' = \"west\"). Meanwhile, *daya only performs in {{lang|ms|barat daya}}, which means \"southwest\".\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] reflex of *lahud, {{lang|jv|lor}}, means \"north\" since the [[Java Sea]] is located to the north of the island of [[Java]].\n\n===Numerals===\nBelow are reconstructed Proto-Austronesian, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, Proto-Oceanic, and Proto-Polynesian numbers from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database.<ref>[http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/ Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Numerals\n!c=01| Number\n!c=02| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=03| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n!c=04| Proto-Oceanic\n!c=05| Proto-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=01| one\n|c=02| *esa, *isa\n|c=03| *esa, *isa\n|c=04| *sa-kai, *ta-sa, *tai, *kai\n|c=05| *taha\n|-\n|c=01| two\n|c=02| *duSa\n|c=03| *duha\n|c=04| *rua\n|c=05| *rua\n|-\n|c=01| three\n|c=02| *telu\n|c=03| *telu\n|c=04| *tolu\n|c=05| *tolu\n|-\n|c=01| four\n|c=02| *Sepat\n|c=03| *epat\n|c=04| *pat, *pati, *pani\n|c=05| *faa\n|-\n|c=01| five\n|c=02| *lima\n|c=03| *lima\n|c=04| *lima\n|c=05| *lima\n|}\n\nThe Proto-Austronesian language had different sets of numerals for non-humans (\"set A\") and humans (\"set B\") (Blust 2009:279). Cardinal numerals for counting humans are derived from the non-human numerals through Ca-reduplication. This bipartite numeral system is found in Thao, Puyuma, Yami, Chamorro, and various other languages (however, Paiwan uses {{lang|pwn|ma-}} and {{lang|pwn|man\u0259-}} to derive human numerals). In many Philippine languages such as Tagalog, the two numeral systems are merged (Blust 2009:280-281).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Basic numerals vs. human numerals\n!c=01| Number\n!c=02| Set A\n!c=03| Set B\n!c=04| Tagalog\n|-\n|c=01| one\n|c=02| *isa\n|c=03| *?\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|isa}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| two\n|c=02| *duSa\n|c=03| *da-duSa\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|dalawa}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| three\n|c=02| *telu\n|c=03| *ta-telu\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|tatlo}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| four\n|c=02| *Sepat\n|c=03| *Sa-Sepat\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|apat}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| five\n|c=02| *lima\n|c=03| *la-lima\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|lima}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| six\n|c=02| *enem\n|c=03| *a-enem\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|anim}} (B)\n|-\n|c=01| seven\n|c=02| *pitu\n|c=03| *pa-pitu\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|pito}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| eight\n|c=02| *walu\n|c=03| *wa-walu\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|walo}} (A)\n|-\n|c=01| nine\n|c=02| *Siwa\n|c=03| *Sa-Siwa\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|(siyam)}}\n|-\n|c=01| ten\n|c=02| *sa-puluq\n|c=03| *?\n|c=04| {{lang|tl|sampu}}\n|}\n\nProto-Austronesian also used *Sika- to derive [[ordinal numerals]] (Blust 2009:281).\n\n===Verbs===\nBelow are reconstructed Proto-Austronesian, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, Proto-Oceanic, and Proto-Polynesian verbs from the [http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/ Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Verbs\n!c=01| Verb\n!c=02| Proto-Austronesian\n!c=03| Proto-Malayo-Polynesian\n!c=04| Proto-Oceanic\n!c=05| Proto-Polynesian\n|-\n|c=01| to walk\n|c=02| *Nakaw\n|c=03| *lakaw, paNaw\n|c=04| *lako, pano\n|c=05| *fano\n|-\n|c=01| to swim\n|c=02| *Na\u014buy\n|c=03| *na\u014buy\n|c=04| *kakaRu\n|c=05| *kaukau\n|-\n|c=01| to know\n|c=02| *bajaq\n|c=03| *taqu\n|c=04| *taqu\n|c=05| *qiloa\n|-\n|c=01| to think\n|c=02| *nemnem\n|c=03| *demdem\n|c=04| *rodrom\n|c=05| *manatu\n|-\n|c=01| to sleep\n|c=02| *tuduR\n|c=03| *tuduR\n|c=04| *turuR\n|c=05| *mohe\n|-\n|c=01| to stand\n|c=02| *diRi\n|c=03| *diRi, *tuqud\n|c=04| *tuqur\n|c=05| *tuqu\n|-\n|c=01| to sew\n|c=02| *taSiq\n|c=03| *tahiq, *zaqit\n|c=04| *saqit, *turi\n|c=05| *tui\n|-\n|c=01| to die, be dead\n|c=02| *m-aCay\n|c=03| *m-atay\n|c=04| *mate\n|c=05| *mate\n|-\n|c=01| to choose\n|c=02| *piliq\n|c=03| *piliq\n|c=04| *piliq\n|c=05| *fili\n|-\n|c=01| to fly\n|c=02| *layap\n|c=03| *layap, Rebek\n|c=04| *Ropok\n|c=05| *lele\n|}\n\n==Monosyllabic roots==\nThe following are monosyllabic Proto-Austronesian roots reconstructed by John Wolff (Wolff 1999).<ref>Wolff, John. 1999. \"The monosyllabic roots of Proto-Austronesian.\" In Elizabeth Zeitoun and Paul Jen-kuei Li, eds. 1999.

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|[[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau]], ''Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien'']]\nRavaisson's chief philosophical works are: \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893).

A. Knopf (1947), p. 148</ref> Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow.  He studied many fields while in school, including law and economics.  Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the [[Vologda]] region north of Moscow. In ''Looks on the Past'', he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them, he felt that he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), was reflected in much of his early work.  A few years later he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing, \"Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul\".<ref name=\"Sadler2004\">{{cite book|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|others=translated by Michael T. H.

That same year, before leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''; this, to him, had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves. Later, he would write about this experience:\n\n{{quote|That it was a haystack the catalogue informed me. I could not recognise it. This non-recognition was painful to me. I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly. I dully felt that the object of the painting was missing.

Hall & Co.|page=363}}</ref> |Wassily Kandinsky}}\n\nKandinsky was similarly influenced during this period by [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' which, he felt, pushed the limits of music and melody beyond standard lyricism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruckblick|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|publisher=Woldemar Klein Verlag|year=1955|isbn=|location=Baden-Baden|pages=12}}</ref> He was also spiritually influenced by [[Madame Blavatsky]] (1831\u20131891), the best-known exponent of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]. Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares. Kandinsky's book ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (1910) and ''Point and Line to Plane'' (1926) echoed this theosophical tenet. Illustrations by John Varley in ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' (1901) influenced him visually.<ref>[[Sixten Ringbom]], The sounding cosmos; a study in the spiritualism of Kandinsky and the genesis of abstract painting, (Abo [Finland]: Abo Akademi, 1970), pgs 89 & 148a.</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Artistic metamorphosis (1896\u20131911)}}Metamorphosis ===\nIn the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps. She accepted, and their relationship became more personal than professional.\nArt school, usually considered difficult, was easy for Kandinsky. It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter. The number of his existing paintings increased in the beginning of the 20th century; much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted, using broad swaths of colour and recognisable forms. For the most part, however, Kandinsky's paintings did not feature any human figures; an exception is ''Sunday, Old Russia'' (1904), in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town. ''Riding Couple'' (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a blue river. The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness. This work demonstrates the influence of [[pointillism]] in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat, luminescent surface. [[Fauvism]] is also apparent in these early works.  Colours are used to express Kandinsky's experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature.\n\nPerhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was ''The Blue Rider'' (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow. The rider's cloak is medium blue, which casts a darker-blue shadow. In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, the counterparts of the fall trees in the background. The blue rider in the painting is prominent (but not clearly defined), and the horse has an unnatural gait (which Kandinsky must have known). Some art historians believe {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} that a second figure (perhaps a child) is being held by the rider, although this may be another shadow from the solitary rider. This intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years; it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911\u20131914 period. In ''The Blue Rider'', Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail. This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters, but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe (he was an associate of the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] symbolist group of Moscow), until he settled in the small [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]. In 1908 he bought a copy of ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. In 1909 he joined the Theosophical Society. ''The Blue Mountain'' (1908\u20131909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence. The broad use of color in ''The Blue Mountain'' illustrates Kandinsky's inclination toward an art in which color is presented independently of form, and which each color is given equal attention. The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree and the blue mountain with the three riders.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1898 - Odessa Port.jpg|''Odessa Port'', 1898, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow \nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1901 - Akhtyrka.jpg|''Akhtyrka'', 1901, [[Lenbachhaus]], Kunstarealm, Munich\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1906 - Rotterdam sun.jpg|''Rotterdam Sun'', 1906\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908, Murnau, Dorfstrasse.jpg|''Murnau, Dorfstrasse (Street in Murnau, A Village Street)'', 1908, {{interlanguage link|Werner Merzbacher|de}} Collection\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908 - Houses in Munich.jpg|''Houses in Munich'', 1908\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1909 - Murnau train et ch\u00e2teau.jpg|''Murnau, train & castle'', 1909\n</gallery>\n\n=== Blue Rider Period (1911\u20131914) ===\n{{See also|Der Blaue Reiter}}\n[[File:Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, Landscape with Factory Chimney, oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, Solomon R.

Music was important to the birth of abstract art, since music is abstract by nature\u2014it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions.\"\n\nIn addition to painting, Kandinsky was an art theorist; his influence on the history of [[Western art]] stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings. He helped found the [[Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen]] (Munich New Artists' Association), becoming its president in 1909. However, the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky (and others) with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911. Kandinsky then formed a new group, the Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) with like-minded artists such as [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Albert Bloch]], and [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. The group released an almanac (''The Blue Rider Almanac'') and held two exhibits. More of each were planned, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]].\n\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1912 - Improvisation 27, Garden of Love II.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, ''Improvisation 27 (Garden of Love II)'', 1912, oil on canvas, 120.3 x 140.3 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. Exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]].]]\nHis writing in ''The Blue Rider Almanac'' and the treatise \"On the Spiritual In Art\" (which was released in 1910) were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality. He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous, apart from the visual description of an object or other form.\n\nThese ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world.<ref>See Michael Paraskos, \"English Expressionism,\" MRes Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds 1997, p103f</ref> As early as 1912, ''On the Spiritual In Art'' was reviewed by [[Michael Sadleir]] in the London-based ''Art News.''<ref>Michael Sadleir, Review of Uber da Geistige an der Kunst by Wassily Kandinsky, in \"The Art News,\" 9 March 1912, p.45</ref> Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of ''On the Spiritual In Art'' in 1914. Extracts from the book were published that year in [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]]'s periodical ''[[BLAST (magazine)|Blast]],'' and [[Alfred Orage]]'s weekly cultural newspaper ''[[The New Age]]''. Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists' Exhibition (organised by [[Frank Rutter]]) at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist [[Spencer Frederick Gore]] in ''The Art News''.<ref>Spencer Frederick Gore, \"The Allied Artists' Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall (London)\", in \"The Art News,\" 4 August 1910, p.254</ref>\n\nSadleir's interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky's first works entering a British art collection; Sadleir's father, [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]], acquired several wood-prints and the abstract painting ''Fragment for Composition VII'' in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year. These works were displayed in [[Leeds]], either in the University or the premises of the [[Leeds Arts Club]], between 1913 and 1923.<ref>Tom Steele, \"Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club 1893\u20131923\" (Mitcham, Orage Press, 2009) 218f</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1910 - The Cow.jpg|''The Cow'', 1910, [[Lenbachhaus]], Munich\nFile:Kandinsky Study for Improvisation V MIA 67342.jpg|''Study for Improvisation V '', 1910\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky, 1911, Reiter (Lyrishes), oil on canvas, 94 x 130 cm, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen.jpg|''The Rider'', 1911\nFile:Vassilly Kandinsky, 1912 - Landscape With Two Poplars.jpg|''Landscape With Two Poplars'' 1912\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Color Study, Squares with Concentric Circles.jpg|''Squares with Concentric Circles'', 1913\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|''Composition 6'', 1913\nFile:W.

He painted little during this period, but devoted his time to artistic teaching, with a program based on form and colour analysis; he also helped organize the [[Institute of Artistic Culture]] in [[Moscow]] of which he was the first director. His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois. In 1921, Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the [[Bauhaus]] of [[Weimar]] by its founder, architect [[Walter Gropius]].\n\n===Back in Germany and the Bauhaus (1922\u20131933) ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - On White II.jpg|thumb|''On White II'', 1923]]\nIn May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the \"Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists\".<ref name=\"Review\">{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, \u201cA Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists\u2019 Groups\u201d (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the [[Bauhaus]]; he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology. The development of his works on forms study, particularly on points and line forms, led to the publication of his second theoretical book (''Point and Line to Plane'') in 1926. His examinations of the effects of forces on straight lines, leading to the contrasting tones of curved and angled lines, coincided with the research of Gestalt psychologists, whose work was also discussed at the Bauhaus.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kandinsky|last = D\u00fcchting|first = Hajo|publisher = Taschen|year = 2013|isbn = 978-3-8365-3146-7|location = |pages = 68}}</ref> Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting\u2014particularly the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves. This period was intensely productive. This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations\u2014as in ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and [[suprematism]] movements influential at the time.\n\nThe two-metre-wide ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925)  of several main forms: a vertical yellow rectangle, an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle; a multitude of straight (or sinuous) black lines, circular arcs, monochromatic circles and scattered, coloured checker-boards contribute to its delicate complexity. This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work, whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation\u2014not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship, their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony.\n\nKandinsky was one of [[Die Blaue Vier]] (Blue Four), formed in 1923 with [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], which lectured and exhibited in the United States in 1924. Due to right-wing hostility, the Bauhaus left Weimar and settled in [[Dessau]] in 1925. Following a Nazi smear campaign the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for [[Berlin]], until its dissolution in July 1933. Kandinsky then left Germany, settling in [[Paris]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1922 - Kleine Welten I.jpg|''Small worlds I'', 1922\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - Circles in a Circle.jpg|''Circles in a Circle'', 1923\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1926 - Several Circles, Gugg 0910 25.jpg|''Several Circles'', 1926\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1927 - Molle rudesse.jpg|''Soft Hard'', 1927\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky - Inner Alliance - 1929.jpg|''Inner Aliance'', 1929\n</gallery>\n\n=== Great Synthesis (1934\u20131944) ===\n\nLiving in an apartment in Paris, Kandinsky created his work in a living-room studio. [[Biomorphism|Biomorphic]] forms with supple, non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings\u2014forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist's inner life. Kandinsky used original colour compositions, evoking Slavic popular art. He also occasionally mixed sand with paint to give a granular, rustic texture to his paintings.\n\nThis period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky's previous work in which he used all elements, enriching them. In 1936 and 1939 he painted his final two major compositions, the type of elaborate canvases he had not produced for many years. ''Composition IX'' has highly contrasted, powerful diagonals whose central form gives the impression of an embryo in the womb. Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the black background of ''Composition X'' as star fragments (or [[Solar filament|filaments]]), while enigmatic [[hieroglyph]]s with pastel tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper-left corner of the canvas. In Kandinsky's work some characteristics are obvious, while certain touches are more discreet and veiled; they reveal themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 38-45 (The disclosure of pictoriality)</ref> He intended his forms (which he subtly harmonised and placed) to resonate with the observer's soul.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1935 - Brown with supplement.jpg|''Brown with supplement'', 1935\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1936 - Composition IX.jpg|''Composition IX'', 1936\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1939 - Composition 10.jpg|''Composition X'', 1939\n</gallery>\n\n== Kandinsky's conception of art ==\n{{Main|List of paintings by Wassily Kandinsky}}\n=== The artist as prophet ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|thumb|''Composition&nbsp;VII'', [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. According to Kandinsky, this is the most complex piece he ever painted (1913)|alt=Large, colourful abstract painting]]\nWriting that \"music is the ultimate teacher,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/quotes.php|title=Wassily Kandinsky \u2013 Quotes|website=www.wassilykandinsky.net|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> Kandinsky embarked upon the first seven of his ten ''Compositions''. The first three survive only in black-and-white photographs taken by fellow artist and friend [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. While studies, sketches, and improvisations exist (particularly of ''Composition II''), a Nazi raid on the [[Bauhaus]] in the 1930s resulted in the confiscation of Kandinsky's first three ''Compositions.'' They were displayed in the State-sponsored exhibit \"[[Degenerate Art]]\", and then destroyed (along with works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Franz Marc]] and other modern artists).\n\nFascinated by [[Christian eschatology]] and the perception of a coming New Age,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rabinovich|first1=Yakov|title=Kandinsky:   Master of the Mystic Arts|url=http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Kandinsky.htm}}</ref> a common theme among Kandinsky's first seven ''Compositions'' is the [[apocalypse]] (the end of the world as we know it). Writing of the \"artist as prophet\" in his book, ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'', Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality. Having a devout belief in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bauhaus Group: Six Masters of Modernism|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter11/columbia_forum|website=Columbia College Today}}</ref> Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of [[Noah's Ark]], [[Jonah]] and the whale, Christ's [[resurrection]], the [[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in the [[book of Revelation]], Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth. Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death\u2013rebirth and destruction\u2013creation he felt were imminent in the pre-[[World War I]] world.\n\nAs he stated in ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (see below), Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from \"an internal necessity\" inhabits the tip of an upward-moving pyramid. This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future. What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today; what is ''avant garde'' today (and understood only by the few) is common knowledge tomorrow. The modern artist\u2013prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid, making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow's reality. Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world.\n\n''Composition IV'' and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist. As in his painting of the apocalypse by water (''Composition VI''), Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms (with a sense of desperation, flurry, urgency, and confusion). This spiritual communion of viewer-painting-artist/prophet may be described within the limits of words and images.\n\n=== Artistic and spiritual theorist ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|thumb|''Composition VI'' (1913)|alt=Rectangular, multicoloured abstract painting]]\nAs the ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]] Almanac'' essays and theorising with composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind ([[synesthesia]]). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorised that (for example), yellow is the colour of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}</ref><ref>Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolours by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991</ref>\n\nKandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships\u2014claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul. These theories are explained in ''Point and Line to Plane'' (see below).\n\nKandinsky's legendary stage design for a performance of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]\" illustrates his synaesthetic concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bauhaus|last=Fiedler|first=Jeannine|publisher=h.f.ullmann publishing GmbH|year=2013|isbn=978-3-8480-0275-7|location=Germany|pages=262|via=}}</ref> In 1928 in the theater of Dessau, Wassily Kandinsky realized the stage production of \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". In 2015 the original designs of the stage elements were animated with modern video technology and synchronized with the music according to the preparatory notes of Kandinsky and the director's script of Felix Klee.\n\nDuring the studies Kandinsky made in preparation for ''Composition IV,'' he became exhausted while working on a painting and went for a walk. While he was out, Gabriele M\u00fcnter tidied his studio and inadvertently turned his canvas on its side. Upon returning and seeing the canvas (but not yet recognizing it) Kandinsky fell to his knees and wept, saying it was the most beautiful painting he had ever seen. He had been liberated from attachment to an object. As when he first viewed Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', the experience would change his life.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn another episode with M\u00fcnter during the Bavarian [[abstract expressionist]] years, Kandinsky was working on his ''Composition VI''. From nearly six months of study and preparation, he had intended the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction, and rebirth simultaneously. After outlining the work on a mural-sized wood panel, he became blocked and could not go on. M\u00fcnter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture. She suggested he simply repeat the word ''uberflut'' (\"deluge\" or \"flood\") and focus on its sound rather than its meaning. Repeating this word like a mantra, Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three-day span.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Theoretical writings on art ==\nKandinsky's analyses on forms and colours result not from simple, arbitrary idea-associations but from the painter's inner experience. He spent years creating [[Abstract art|abstract]], sensorially rich paintings, working with form and colour, tirelessly observing his own paintings and those of other artists, noting their effects on his sense of colour.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 5-11</ref> This subjective experience is something that anyone can do\u2014not scientific, objective observations but inner, subjective ones, what French philosopher [[Michel Henry]] calls  \"absolute subjectivity\" or the \"absolute [[phenomenological life]]\".<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 27</ref>\n\n=== ''Concerning the spiritual in art'' ===\n\nPublished in Munich in 1911, Kandinsky's text, ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst'', defines three types of painting; ''impressions'', ''improvisations'' and ''compositions''. While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though ''composition'' is developed from a more formal point of view.<ref name=\"Pompidou\">{{cite web|url=http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-kandinsky-mono/ENS-kandinsky-monographie.html|title=Vassily Kandinsky|website=mediation.centrepompidou.fr}}</ref> Kandinsky compares the [[spirituality|spiritual]] life of humanity to a [[pyramid]]\u2014the artist has a mission to lead others to the pinnacle with his work. The point of the pyramid is those few, great artists. It is a spiritual pyramid, advancing and ascending slowly even if it sometimes appears immobile. During decadent periods, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] sinks to the bottom of the pyramid; humanity searches only for external success, ignoring spiritual forces.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d. Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 61-75</ref>\n\nColours on the painter's palette evoke a double effect: a purely physical effect on the eye which is charmed by the beauty of colours, similar to the joyful impression when we eat a delicacy. This effect can be much deeper, however, causing a vibration of the soul or an \"inner resonance\"\u2014a spiritual effect in which the colour touches the soul itself.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d.

He called the physical support and the material surface on which the artist draws or paints the ''basic plane'', or BP.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143</ref> He did not analyze them objectively, but from the point of view of their inner effect on the observer.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d. Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 45 : \"Les id\u00e9es que je d\u00e9veloppe ici sont le r\u00e9sultat d'observations et d'exp\u00e9riences int\u00e9rieures\" c'est-\u00e0-dire purement subjectives. Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour ''Point et ligne sur plan'' qui en est \"le d\u00e9veloppement organique\" (avant-propos de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 9).</ref>\n\nA point is a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas. It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and colour. This form can be a square, a triangle, a circle, a star or something more complex. The point is the most concise form but, according to its placement on the basic plane, it will take a different tonality. It can be isolated or resonate with other points or lines.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 25-63</ref>\n\nA line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction: the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist. The produced linear forms may be of several types: a ''straight'' line, which results from a unique force applied in a single direction; an ''angular'' line, resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions, or a ''curved'' (or ''wave-like'') line, produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously. A ''plane'' may be obtained by condensation (from a line rotated around one of its ends).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 67-71</ref>\nThe subjective effect produced by a line depends on its orientation: a ''horizontal'' line corresponds with the ground on which man rests and moves; it possesses a dark and cold affective tonality similar to black or blue. A ''vertical'' line corresponds with height, and offers no support; it possesses a luminous, warm tonality close to white and yellow. A ''diagonal'' possesses a more-or-less warm (or cold) tonality, according to its inclination toward the horizontal or the vertical.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 69-70</ref>\n\nA force which deploys itself, without obstacle, as the one which produces a straight line corresponds with ''lyricism''; several forces which confront (or annoy) each other form a ''drama''.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, pp. 80\u201382</ref> The ''angle'' formed by the angular line also has an inner sonority which is warm and close to yellow for an acute angle (a triangle), cold and similar to blue for an obtuse angle (a circle), and similar to red for a right angle (a square).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 89</ref>\n\nThe basic plane is, in general, rectangular or square. therefore, it is composed of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting, communicating its affective tonality. This tonality is determined by the relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines: the horizontals giving a calm, cold tonality to the basic plane while the verticals impart a calm, warm tonality.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143-145</ref> The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions, which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work. Kandinsky considered the basic plane a living being, which the artist \"fertilises\" and feels \"breathing\".<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 145-146</ref>\n\nEach part of the basic plane possesses an affective colouration; this influences the tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it, and contributes to the richness of the composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas. The ''above'' of the basic plane corresponds with looseness and to lightness, while the ''below'' evokes condensation and heaviness. The painter's job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process, but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 146-151</ref>\n\nThis book contains many photographic examples and drawing from Kandinsky's works which offer the demonstration of its theoretical observations, and which allow the reader to reproduce in him the inner obviousness provided that he takes the time to look at those pictures with care, that he let them acting on its own sensibility and that he let vibrating the sensible and spiritual strings of his soul.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d.

A. Knopf (1947), p. 148</ref> Kandinsky learned from a variety of sources while in Moscow.  He studied many fields while in school, including law and economics.  Later in life, he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the [[Vologda]] region north of Moscow. In ''Looks on the Past'', he relates that the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that upon entering them, he felt that he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), was reflected in much of his early work.  A few years later he first likened painting to composing music in the manner for which he would become noted, writing, \"Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand which plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul\".<ref name=\"Sadler2004\">{{cite book|last=Kandinsky|first=Wassily|others=translated by Michael T. H.

That same year, before leaving Moscow, he saw an exhibit of paintings by [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. He was particularly taken with the impressionistic style of ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''; this, to him, had a powerful sense of colour almost independent of the objects themselves. Later, he would write about this experience:\n\n{{quote|That it was a haystack the catalogue informed me. I could not recognise it. This non-recognition was painful to me. I considered that the painter had no right to paint indistinctly. I dully felt that the object of the painting was missing.

Theosophical theory postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning with a single point. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares. Kandinsky's book ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (1910) and ''Point and Line to Plane'' (1926) echoed this theosophical tenet. Illustrations by John Varley in ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' (1901) influenced him visually.<ref>[[Sixten Ringbom]], The sounding cosmos; a study in the spiritualism of Kandinsky and the genesis of abstract painting, (Abo [Finland]: Abo Akademi, 1970), pgs 89 & 148a.</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Artistic metamorphosis (1896\u20131911)}}Metamorphosis ===\nIn the summer of 1902, Kandinsky invited [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] to join him at his summer painting classes just south of Munich in the Alps. She accepted, and their relationship became more personal than professional.\nArt school, usually considered difficult, was easy for Kandinsky. It was during this time that he began to emerge as an art theorist as well as a painter. The number of his existing paintings increased in the beginning of the 20th century; much remains of the landscapes and towns he painted, using broad swaths of colour and recognisable forms. For the most part, however, Kandinsky's paintings did not feature any human figures; an exception is ''Sunday, Old Russia'' (1904), in which Kandinsky recreates a highly colourful (and fanciful) view of peasants and nobles in front of the walls of a town. ''Riding Couple'' (1907) depicts a man on horseback, holding a woman with tenderness and care as they ride past a Russian town with luminous walls across a blue river. The horse is muted while the leaves in the trees, the town, and the reflections in the river glisten with spots of colour and brightness. This work demonstrates the influence of [[pointillism]] in the way the depth of field is collapsed into a flat, luminescent surface. [[Fauvism]] is also apparent in these early works.  Colours are used to express Kandinsky's experience of subject matter, not to describe objective nature.\n\nPerhaps the most important of his paintings from the first decade of the 1900s was ''The Blue Rider'' (1903), which shows a small cloaked figure on a speeding horse rushing through a rocky meadow. The rider's cloak is medium blue, which casts a darker-blue shadow. In the foreground are more amorphous blue shadows, the counterparts of the fall trees in the background. The blue rider in the painting is prominent (but not clearly defined), and the horse has an unnatural gait (which Kandinsky must have known). Some art historians believe {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} that a second figure (perhaps a child) is being held by the rider, although this may be another shadow from the solitary rider. This intentional disjunction, allowing viewers to participate in the creation of the artwork, became an increasingly conscious technique used by Kandinsky in subsequent years; it culminated in the abstract works of the 1911\u20131914 period. In ''The Blue Rider'', Kandinsky shows the rider more as a series of colours than in specific detail. This painting is not exceptional in that regard when compared with contemporary painters, but it shows the direction Kandinsky would take only a few years later.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1908 Kandinsky spent a great deal of time travelling across Europe (he was an associate of the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] symbolist group of Moscow), until he settled in the small [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]. In 1908 he bought a copy of ''[[Thought-Forms (book)|Thought-Forms]]'' by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]]. In 1909 he joined the Theosophical Society. ''The Blue Mountain'' (1908\u20131909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence. The broad use of color in ''The Blue Mountain'' illustrates Kandinsky's inclination toward an art in which color is presented independently of form, and which each color is given equal attention. The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree and the blue mountain with the three riders.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1898 - Odessa Port.jpg|''Odessa Port'', 1898, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow \nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1901 - Akhtyrka.jpg|''Akhtyrka'', 1901, [[Lenbachhaus]], Kunstarealm, Munich\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1906 - Rotterdam sun.jpg|''Rotterdam Sun'', 1906\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908, Murnau, Dorfstrasse.jpg|''Murnau, Dorfstrasse (Street in Murnau, A Village Street)'', 1908, {{interlanguage link|Werner Merzbacher|de}} Collection\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1908 - Houses in Munich.jpg|''Houses in Munich'', 1908\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1909 - Murnau train et ch\u00e2teau.jpg|''Murnau, train & castle'', 1909\n</gallery>\n\n=== Blue Rider Period (1911\u20131914) ===\n{{See also|Der Blaue Reiter}}\n[[File:Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, Landscape with Factory Chimney, oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, 1910, ''Landscape with Factory Chimney'', oil on canvas, 66.2 x 82 cm, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]\nKandinsky's paintings from this period are large, expressive coloured masses evaluated independently from forms and lines; these serve no longer to delimit them, but overlap freely to form paintings of extraordinary force. Music was important to the birth of abstract art, since music is abstract by nature\u2014it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. Kandinsky sometimes used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions.\"\n\nIn addition to painting, Kandinsky was an art theorist; his influence on the history of [[Western art]] stems perhaps more from his theoretical works than from his paintings. He helped found the [[Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen]] (Munich New Artists' Association), becoming its president in 1909. However, the group could not integrate the radical approach of Kandinsky (and others) with conventional artistic concepts and the group dissolved in late 1911. Kandinsky then formed a new group, the Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) with like-minded artists such as [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Albert Bloch]], and [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. The group released an almanac (''The Blue Rider Almanac'') and held two exhibits. More of each were planned, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 ended these plans and sent Kandinsky back to Russia via [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]].\n\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1912 - Improvisation 27, Garden of Love II.jpg|thumb|Wassily Kandinsky, ''Improvisation 27 (Garden of Love II)'', 1912, oil on canvas, 120.3 x 140.3 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. Exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]].]]\nHis writing in ''The Blue Rider Almanac'' and the treatise \"On the Spiritual In Art\" (which was released in 1910) were both a defence and promotion of abstract art and an affirmation that all forms of art were equally capable of reaching a level of spirituality. He believed that colour could be used in a painting as something autonomous, apart from the visual description of an object or other form.\n\nThese ideas had an almost-immediate international impact, particularly in the English-speaking world.<ref>See Michael Paraskos, \"English Expressionism,\" MRes Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds 1997, p103f</ref> As early as 1912, ''On the Spiritual In Art'' was reviewed by [[Michael Sadleir]] in the London-based ''Art News.''<ref>Michael Sadleir, Review of Uber da Geistige an der Kunst by Wassily Kandinsky, in \"The Art News,\" 9 March 1912, p.45</ref> Interest in Kandinsky grew apace when Sadleir published an English translation of ''On the Spiritual In Art'' in 1914. Extracts from the book were published that year in [[Percy Wyndham Lewis]]'s periodical ''[[BLAST (magazine)|Blast]],'' and [[Alfred Orage]]'s weekly cultural newspaper ''[[The New Age]]''. Kandinsky had received some notice earlier in Britain, however; in 1910, he participated in the Allied Artists' Exhibition (organised by [[Frank Rutter]]) at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. This resulted in his work being singled out for praise in a review of that show by the artist [[Spencer Frederick Gore]] in ''The Art News''.<ref>Spencer Frederick Gore, \"The Allied Artists' Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall (London)\", in \"The Art News,\" 4 August 1910, p.254</ref>\n\nSadleir's interest in Kandinsky also led to Kandinsky's first works entering a British art collection; Sadleir's father, [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]], acquired several wood-prints and the abstract painting ''Fragment for Composition VII'' in 1913 following a visit by father and son to meet Kandinsky in Munich that year. These works were displayed in [[Leeds]], either in the University or the premises of the [[Leeds Arts Club]], between 1913 and 1923.<ref>Tom Steele, \"Alfred Orage and the Leeds Arts Club 1893\u20131923\" (Mitcham, Orage Press, 2009) 218f</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1910 - The Cow.jpg|''The Cow'', 1910, [[Lenbachhaus]], Munich\nFile:Kandinsky Study for Improvisation V MIA 67342.jpg|''Study for Improvisation V '', 1910\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky, 1911, Reiter (Lyrishes), oil on canvas, 94 x 130 cm, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen.jpg|''The Rider'', 1911\nFile:Vassilly Kandinsky, 1912 - Landscape With Two Poplars.jpg|''Landscape With Two Poplars'' 1912\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Color Study, Squares with Concentric Circles.jpg|''Squares with Concentric Circles'', 1913\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|''Composition 6'', 1913\nFile:W.

He painted little during this period, but devoted his time to artistic teaching, with a program based on form and colour analysis; he also helped organize the [[Institute of Artistic Culture]] in [[Moscow]] of which he was the first director. His spiritual, expressionistic view of art was ultimately rejected by the radical members of the Institute as too individualistic and bourgeois. In 1921, Kandinsky was invited to go to Germany to attend the [[Bauhaus]] of [[Weimar]] by its founder, architect [[Walter Gropius]].\n\n===Back in Germany and the Bauhaus (1922\u20131933) ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - On White II.jpg|thumb|''On White II'', 1923]]\nIn May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the \"Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists\".<ref name=\"Review\">{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, \u201cA Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists\u2019 Groups\u201d (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKandinsky taught the basic design class for beginners and the course on advanced theory at the [[Bauhaus]]; he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form psychology. The development of his works on forms study, particularly on points and line forms, led to the publication of his second theoretical book (''Point and Line to Plane'') in 1926. His examinations of the effects of forces on straight lines, leading to the contrasting tones of curved and angled lines, coincided with the research of Gestalt psychologists, whose work was also discussed at the Bauhaus.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kandinsky|last = D\u00fcchting|first = Hajo|publisher = Taschen|year = 2013|isbn = 978-3-8365-3146-7|location = |pages = 68}}</ref> Geometrical elements took on increasing importance in both his teaching and painting\u2014particularly the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and curves. This period was intensely productive. This freedom is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes rich in colours and gradations\u2014as in ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] and [[suprematism]] movements influential at the time.\n\nThe two-metre-wide ''Yellow \u2013 red \u2013 blue'' (1925)  of several main forms: a vertical yellow rectangle, an inclined red cross and a large dark blue circle; a multitude of straight (or sinuous) black lines, circular arcs, monochromatic circles and scattered, coloured checker-boards contribute to its delicate complexity. This simple visual identification of forms and the main coloured masses present on the canvas is only a first approach to the inner reality of the work, whose appreciation necessitates deeper observation\u2014not only of forms and colours involved in the painting but their relationship, their absolute and relative positions on the canvas and their harmony.\n\nKandinsky was one of [[Die Blaue Vier]] (Blue Four), formed in 1923 with [[Paul Klee]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], which lectured and exhibited in the United States in 1924. Due to right-wing hostility, the Bauhaus left Weimar and settled in [[Dessau]] in 1925. Following a Nazi smear campaign the Bauhaus left Dessau in 1932 for [[Berlin]], until its dissolution in July 1933. Kandinsky then left Germany, settling in [[Paris]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1922 - Kleine Welten I.jpg|''Small worlds I'', 1922\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1923 - Circles in a Circle.jpg|''Circles in a Circle'', 1923\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1926 - Several Circles, Gugg 0910 25.jpg|''Several Circles'', 1926\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1927 - Molle rudesse.jpg|''Soft Hard'', 1927\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky - Inner Alliance - 1929.jpg|''Inner Aliance'', 1929\n</gallery>\n\n=== Great Synthesis (1934\u20131944) ===\n\nLiving in an apartment in Paris, Kandinsky created his work in a living-room studio. [[Biomorphism|Biomorphic]] forms with supple, non-geometric outlines appear in his paintings\u2014forms which suggest microscopic organisms but express the artist's inner life. Kandinsky used original colour compositions, evoking Slavic popular art. He also occasionally mixed sand with paint to give a granular, rustic texture to his paintings.\n\nThis period corresponds to a synthesis of Kandinsky's previous work in which he used all elements, enriching them. In 1936 and 1939 he painted his final two major compositions, the type of elaborate canvases he had not produced for many years. ''Composition IX'' has highly contrasted, powerful diagonals whose central form gives the impression of an embryo in the womb. Small squares of colours and coloured bands stand out against the black background of ''Composition X'' as star fragments (or [[Solar filament|filaments]]), while enigmatic [[hieroglyph]]s with pastel tones cover a large maroon mass which seems to float in the upper-left corner of the canvas. In Kandinsky's work some characteristics are obvious, while certain touches are more discreet and veiled; they reveal themselves only progressively to those who deepen their connection with his work.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 38-45 (The disclosure of pictoriality)</ref> He intended his forms (which he subtly harmonised and placed) to resonate with the observer's soul.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1935 - Brown with supplement.jpg|''Brown with supplement'', 1935\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1936 - Composition IX.jpg|''Composition IX'', 1936\nFile:Vassily Kandinsky, 1939 - Composition 10.jpg|''Composition X'', 1939\n</gallery>\n\n== Kandinsky's conception of art ==\n{{Main|List of paintings by Wassily Kandinsky}}\n=== The artist as prophet ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|thumb|''Composition&nbsp;VII'', [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. According to Kandinsky, this is the most complex piece he ever painted (1913)|alt=Large, colourful abstract painting]]\nWriting that \"music is the ultimate teacher,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/quotes.php|title=Wassily Kandinsky \u2013 Quotes|website=www.wassilykandinsky.net|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> Kandinsky embarked upon the first seven of his ten ''Compositions''. The first three survive only in black-and-white photographs taken by fellow artist and friend [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]]. While studies, sketches, and improvisations exist (particularly of ''Composition II''), a Nazi raid on the [[Bauhaus]] in the 1930s resulted in the confiscation of Kandinsky's first three ''Compositions.'' They were displayed in the State-sponsored exhibit \"[[Degenerate Art]]\", and then destroyed (along with works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Franz Marc]] and other modern artists).\n\nFascinated by [[Christian eschatology]] and the perception of a coming New Age,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rabinovich|first1=Yakov|title=Kandinsky:   Master of the Mystic Arts|url=http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Kandinsky.htm}}</ref> a common theme among Kandinsky's first seven ''Compositions'' is the [[apocalypse]] (the end of the world as we know it). Writing of the \"artist as prophet\" in his book, ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'', Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality. Having a devout belief in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bauhaus Group: Six Masters of Modernism|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter11/columbia_forum|website=Columbia College Today}}</ref> Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of [[Noah's Ark]], [[Jonah]] and the whale, Christ's [[resurrection]], the [[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in the [[book of Revelation]], Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth. Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death\u2013rebirth and destruction\u2013creation he felt were imminent in the pre-[[World War I]] world.\n\nAs he stated in ''Concerning the Spiritual In Art'' (see below), Kandinsky felt that an authentic artist creating art from \"an internal necessity\" inhabits the tip of an upward-moving pyramid. This progressing pyramid is penetrating and proceeding into the future. What was odd or inconceivable yesterday is commonplace today; what is ''avant garde'' today (and understood only by the few) is common knowledge tomorrow. The modern artist\u2013prophet stands alone at the apex of the pyramid, making new discoveries and ushering in tomorrow's reality. Kandinsky was aware of recent scientific developments and the advances of modern artists who had contributed to radically new ways of seeing and experiencing the world.\n\n''Composition IV'' and later paintings are primarily concerned with evoking a spiritual resonance in viewer and artist. As in his painting of the apocalypse by water (''Composition VI''), Kandinsky puts the viewer in the situation of experiencing these epic myths by translating them into contemporary terms (with a sense of desperation, flurry, urgency, and confusion). This spiritual communion of viewer-painting-artist/prophet may be described within the limits of words and images.\n\n=== Artistic and spiritual theorist ===\n[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|thumb|''Composition VI'' (1913)|alt=Rectangular, multicoloured abstract painting]]\nAs the ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]] Almanac'' essays and theorising with composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind ([[synesthesia]]). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorised that (for example), yellow is the colour of middle [[C (musical note)|C]] on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}</ref><ref>Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolours by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991</ref>\n\nKandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships\u2014claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul. These theories are explained in ''Point and Line to Plane'' (see below).\n\nKandinsky's legendary stage design for a performance of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]\" illustrates his synaesthetic concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bauhaus|last=Fiedler|first=Jeannine|publisher=h.f.ullmann publishing GmbH|year=2013|isbn=978-3-8480-0275-7|location=Germany|pages=262|via=}}</ref> In 1928 in the theater of Dessau, Wassily Kandinsky realized the stage production of \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". In 2015 the original designs of the stage elements were animated with modern video technology and synchronized with the music according to the preparatory notes of Kandinsky and the director's script of Felix Klee.\n\nDuring the studies Kandinsky made in preparation for ''Composition IV,'' he became exhausted while working on a painting and went for a walk. While he was out, Gabriele M\u00fcnter tidied his studio and inadvertently turned his canvas on its side. Upon returning and seeing the canvas (but not yet recognizing it) Kandinsky fell to his knees and wept, saying it was the most beautiful painting he had ever seen. He had been liberated from attachment to an object. As when he first viewed Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', the experience would change his life.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn another episode with M\u00fcnter during the Bavarian [[abstract expressionist]] years, Kandinsky was working on his ''Composition VI''. From nearly six months of study and preparation, he had intended the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction, and rebirth simultaneously. After outlining the work on a mural-sized wood panel, he became blocked and could not go on. M\u00fcnter told him that he was trapped in his intellect and not reaching the true subject of the picture. She suggested he simply repeat the word ''uberflut'' (\"deluge\" or \"flood\") and focus on its sound rather than its meaning. Repeating this word like a mantra, Kandinsky painted and completed the monumental work in a three-day span.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Theoretical writings on art ==\nKandinsky's analyses on forms and colours result not from simple, arbitrary idea-associations but from the painter's inner experience. He spent years creating [[Abstract art|abstract]], sensorially rich paintings, working with form and colour, tirelessly observing his own paintings and those of other artists, noting their effects on his sense of colour.<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 5-11</ref> This subjective experience is something that anyone can do\u2014not scientific, objective observations but inner, subjective ones, what French philosopher [[Michel Henry]] calls  \"absolute subjectivity\" or the \"absolute [[phenomenological life]]\".<ref>Michel Henry, ''Seeing the invisible, on Kandinsky'', Continuum, 2009, p. 27</ref>\n\n=== ''Concerning the spiritual in art'' ===\n\nPublished in Munich in 1911, Kandinsky's text, ''\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst'', defines three types of painting; ''impressions'', ''improvisations'' and ''compositions''. While impressions are based on an external reality that serves as a starting point, improvisations and compositions depict images emergent from the unconscious, though ''composition'' is developed from a more formal point of view.<ref name=\"Pompidou\">{{cite web|url=http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-kandinsky-mono/ENS-kandinsky-monographie.html|title=Vassily Kandinsky|website=mediation.centrepompidou.fr}}</ref> Kandinsky compares the [[spirituality|spiritual]] life of humanity to a [[pyramid]]\u2014the artist has a mission to lead others to the pinnacle with his work.

Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 61-75</ref>\n\nColours on the painter's palette evoke a double effect: a purely physical effect on the eye which is charmed by the beauty of colours, similar to the joyful impression when we eat a delicacy.

He called the physical support and the material surface on which the artist draws or paints the ''basic plane'', or BP.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143</ref> He did not analyze them objectively, but from the point of view of their inner effect on the observer.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Du spirituel dans l'art'', \u00e9d. Deno\u00ebl, 1989, p. 45 : \"Les id\u00e9es que je d\u00e9veloppe ici sont le r\u00e9sultat d'observations et d'exp\u00e9riences int\u00e9rieures\" c'est-\u00e0-dire purement subjectives. Cela vaut \u00e9galement pour ''Point et ligne sur plan'' qui en est \"le d\u00e9veloppement organique\" (avant-propos de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9dition, \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 9).</ref>\n\nA point is a small bit of colour put by the artist on the canvas. It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and colour. This form can be a square, a triangle, a circle, a star or something more complex. The point is the most concise form but, according to its placement on the basic plane, it will take a different tonality. It can be isolated or resonate with other points or lines.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 25-63</ref>\n\nA line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction: the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist. The produced linear forms may be of several types: a ''straight'' line, which results from a unique force applied in a single direction; an ''angular'' line, resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions, or a ''curved'' (or ''wave-like'') line, produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously. A ''plane'' may be obtained by condensation (from a line rotated around one of its ends).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 67-71</ref>\nThe subjective effect produced by a line depends on its orientation: a ''horizontal'' line corresponds with the ground on which man rests and moves; it possesses a dark and cold affective tonality similar to black or blue. A ''vertical'' line corresponds with height, and offers no support; it possesses a luminous, warm tonality close to white and yellow. A ''diagonal'' possesses a more-or-less warm (or cold) tonality, according to its inclination toward the horizontal or the vertical.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 69-70</ref>\n\nA force which deploys itself, without obstacle, as the one which produces a straight line corresponds with ''lyricism''; several forces which confront (or annoy) each other form a ''drama''.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, pp. 80\u201382</ref> The ''angle'' formed by the angular line also has an inner sonority which is warm and close to yellow for an acute angle (a triangle), cold and similar to blue for an obtuse angle (a circle), and similar to red for a right angle (a square).<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 89</ref>\n\nThe basic plane is, in general, rectangular or square. therefore, it is composed of horizontal and vertical lines which delimit it and define it as an autonomous entity which supports the painting, communicating its affective tonality. This tonality is determined by the relative importance of horizontal and vertical lines: the horizontals giving a calm, cold tonality to the basic plane while the verticals impart a calm, warm tonality.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 143-145</ref> The artist intuits the inner effect of the canvas format and dimensions, which he chooses according to the tonality he wants to give to his work. Kandinsky considered the basic plane a living being, which the artist \"fertilises\" and feels \"breathing\".<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 145-146</ref>\n\nEach part of the basic plane possesses an affective colouration; this influences the tonality of the pictorial elements which will be drawn on it, and contributes to the richness of the composition resulting from their juxtaposition on the canvas. The ''above'' of the basic plane corresponds with looseness and to lightness, while the ''below'' evokes condensation and heaviness. The painter's job is to listen and know these effects to produce paintings which are not just the effect of a random process, but the fruit of authentic work and the result of an effort towards inner beauty.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, p. 146-151</ref>\n\nThis book contains many photographic examples and drawing from Kandinsky's works which offer the demonstration of its theoretical observations, and which allow the reader to reproduce in him the inner obviousness provided that he takes the time to look at those pictures with care, that he let them acting on its own sensibility and that he let vibrating the sensible and spiritual strings of his soul.<ref>Kandinsky, ''Point et ligne sur plan'', \u00e9d. Gallimard, 1991, Appendice, p. 185-235</ref>\n\n== Miscellaneous information ==\n\n=== Art market ===\nIn 2012, [[Christie's]] auctioned Kandinsky's ''Studie f\u00fcr Improvisation 8 (Study for Improvisation 8)'', a 1909 view of a man wielding a broadsword in a rainbow-hued village, for $23 million.
