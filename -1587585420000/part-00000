It differs from a [[rifle]] with a [[bayonet]] in that the weapon is designed primarily for use as a sword, and the firearm component is typically considered a secondary weapon designed to be an addition to the blade, rather than the sword being a secondary addition to the pistol. In addition, the two components of these weapons typically cannot be separated, unlike most bayonet-fixed rifles.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, some [[flintlock]] pistols of the 17th and 18th centuries were constructed as gun-swords, with the barrel of the pistol attached to the side of the blade of a [[shortsword]] or [[dagger]]. A shell guard protected the firing mechanism when it was used as a sword. These were used by French and German hunters to kill wounded [[wild boar]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.ok.us/~jmdavis/swords.html | last=Davis | first=J.M. | title=Swords & Knives | year=1996 | access-date=2008-10-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503232457/http://www.state.ok.us/~jmdavis/swords.html | archive-date=2007-05-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref><!--Need a better ref for this--> Examples of these weapons can be found in the armoury of [[Wawel Castle]] ([[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland).
