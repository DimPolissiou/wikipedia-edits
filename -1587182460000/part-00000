Due to an increase in the number of students, a new campus is being constructed in Kwala Bekala, about 15&nbsp;kilometers away from the original campus, on an area of about 300 hectares.<ref>http://www.usu.ac.id/en/campus-location.html</ref>\n\nThe rectors of the university serve an eight-year renewable term.\n\nUSU was established as a Foundation Universitet North Sumatera on June 4, 1952. Initially, the foundation provided only one department, which was the Faculty of Medicine, established on August 20, 1952, now commemorated as the anniversary of USU. The first President of Indonesia, Soekarno, inaugurated USU on November 20, 1957, as the seventh state university in Indonesia.\n\n==History==\n\nThe history of the University of North Sumatra began with the founding of North Sumatra Universitet Foundation on June 4, 1952. The establishment of the foundation was spearheaded by the Governor of North Sumatra to meet the wishes of the people of North Sumatra, Indonesia, in particular, and society, in general.\n\nThe Foundation was managed by a Board, chaired by the Governor of North Sumatra, with the following composition:\n* Abdul Hakim (Chairman)\n* Dr. T. Mansoer (Vice Chairman)\n* Dr. Soemarsono (Secretary / Treasurer)\n* Members:\n** Ir. R. S. Danunagoro\n** Drh. Sahar\n** Drg. Oh Tjie Lien\n** Anwar Abubakar\n** Madong Lubis\n** Dr. Maas. J. Trees\n** Drg. Barlan\n** Soetan Paruhum Pane\n\nThe desire to establish a public university in Medan began before the World War II, but it was not approved by the Dutch colonial government who ruled Indonesia at the time. During the Japanese occupation after the fall of the Dutch colonialism, some prominent people in the Indonesian medicine field, such as Dr. Pirngadi and Dr. T. Mansoer, drafted a plan for a medical school. After Indonesia declared its independence on August 17, 1945, the government appointed Dr. Mohd. Djamil in Bukit Tinggi as the chairman of the committee to establish the plan. However, another revolutionary war in 1947, that required the restoration of the sovereignty of the Indonesian government, delayed this plan. Then the North Sumatra Governor, Abdul Hakim, took the initiative to encourage the residents of North Sumatra province to raise the money to build the first public university in the region.\n\nOn December 31, 1951, the preparatory committee to found the university was formed, chaired by Dr. Soemarsono. The members of the committee included Dr. Ahmad Sofian, Ir. Danunagoro, and Mr. Djaidin Antique as the secretary. Aside from the committee, the Leadership Council Foundation was also established. In its early years, the Organization of USU was consisted of the Board of Curators, the University President, the Assembly President and Assessors, the University Senate, and the Faculty Board.\n\nAs a result of the cooperation, moral and material assistance from the entire community of the North Sumatera province at that time, including the Special Territory of Aceh, the Faculty of Medicine was successfully established on August 20, 1952. It was first housed in a building on Seram Street, with twenty-seven students, among them were two females.\n\nAfterward, the establishment of the Faculty of Law and Public Administration followed in 1954. The Faculty of Teaching and Science Education was found in 1956, along with the Faculty of Agriculture.\n\nOn November 20, 1957, the first President of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. Ir. Soekarno, inaugurated the University of North Sumatra (with \"USU\" as the acronym in the local language). It became the seventh state university in Indonesia. The inauguration date was set as the Dies Natalis USU (the anniversary of the University of North Sumatra), and commemorated every year until 2001.\n\nAt the suggestion of several members of the University Senate, the date of the anniversary of the University of North Sumatra was then reviewed. The University Senate eventually decided that the date of the USU anniversary should be commemorated on August 20, considering that the university had conducted its very first lecture on August 20, 1952. With the approval of the Ministry of National Education, the University of North Sumatra commemorated its 50th anniversary on August 20, 2002.\n\nIn 1959, the university started the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Economics in Medan. It was also inaugurated by President Soekarno. A year later, in 1960, the university opened the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry in Kutaradja, Banda Aceh. Less than a decade after being founded, USU was already running seven departments: five faculties in Medan, North Sumatra, and two faculties in the Aceh province. So much progress had been achieved within a short time, with the implementation of various programs.\n\nToday the University of North Sumatra provides more than one hundred study programs, consisted of various levels of higher education, covered in ten faculties and one graduate department. During the process, some departments of the university have become the embryos of three public universities, namely the Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh, Aceh Province (the expansion of the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry); the Medan College of State Teachers and Trainings (the expansion of the Faculty of Teaching and Science Education); and the Medan Polytechnic College (the Polytechnic College of the University of North Sumatra).\n\n==Faculties==\n\n*[[Graduate School]]\n*Faculty of [[Nursing]]\n*Faculty of [[Psychology]]\n*Faculty of [[Pharmacy]]\n*Faculty of [[Public health|Public Health]]\n*Faculty of [[Social Science|Social]] and [[Political Sciences]]\n*Faculty of [[Mathematics]] and [[Natural Sciences]]\n*Faculty of [[Literature]]\n*Faculty of [[Dentistry]]\n*Faculty of [[Economics and Business]]\n*Faculty of [[Engineering]]\n*Faculty of [[Agriculture]]\n*Faculty of [[Forestry]]\n*Faculty of [[Law]]\n*Faculty of [[Medicine]]\n*Faculty of [[Computer Science]] and [[Information Technology]]\n\n==USU Teaching Hospital==\nUniversity of Sumatera Utara is the biggest teaching hospital in [[Indonesia]].<ref>http://waspada.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=194336:usus-hospital-is-the-biggest-in-indonesia&catid=30:english-news&Itemid=101</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Universities in Indonesia}}\n\n{{coord missing|North Sumatra}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Universities in Medan]]\n[[Category:Indonesian state universities]]\n[[Category:Universities in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1952]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox University\n|name         = Universitas Sumatera Utara\n|image_name   = University of north sumatera logo.jpg \n|image_size   = 200px\n|image_alt    = \n|caption      = \n|mottoeng        = Toward Excellence as University for Industry\n|motto     = Menuju Keunggulan sebagai Universitas untuk Industri\n|established  = 20 November 1957<br /><small>(Diresmikan)</small><br />20 August 1952<ref>[http://www.usu.ac.id/tentang-usu/sejarah.html Sejarah - University of Sumatera Utara]</ref>\n|type         = [[Public university|Public]]\n|rector       = Prof. Dr. [[Runtung Sitepu]], S.H., M.Hum.\n|academic_staff = 1459 (S2/Sp1), 1409 (S3/Sp2) <ref name=lakip>{{cite web |url=https://www.usu.ac.id/images/LAKIP_2018/LAKIP_USU_2017_FINAL_27_Juli_2018_final_fix.pdf |title=Laporan Akuntabilitas Kinerja Instansi Pemerintah USU 2017 |website=Universitas Sumatera Utara |accessdate=2017-06-15}}</ref>\n|administrative_staff = 1020 <ref name=lakip/>\n|students     = 50.809 <ref name=lakip/>\n|undergrad    = \n|postgrad     = \n|doctoral     = \n|city         = Jl.

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary John Batchelor (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

In September 2012, mathematical models created by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NRIESDP) suggested that the pressure in Mount Fuji's [[magma chamber]] could be 1.6 [[pascal (unit)|megapascals]] higher than it was before its last eruption in 1707. This was interpreted by some media outlets to mean that an eruption of Mount Fuji could be imminent.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/06/mount-fuji |title=Pressure in Mount Fuji is now higher than last eruption, warn experts | last1=Clark | first1=Liat | magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=September 6, 2012 | access-date=September 6, 2012}}</ref> However, since there is no known method of directly measuring the pressure of a volcano's magma chamber, indirect calculations of the type used by NRIESDP are speculative and unverifiable.

They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,<!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid. --> [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.<ref name=MountainTrails>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction.

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary John Batchelor (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location. These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago. Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, and is located 20&nbsp;km southeast of Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic [[cinder cone]]s, ceased in 1707. The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit. Mt. Fuji also has more than 70 [[lava tunnel]]s and extensive lava tree molds.

Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit.

This crater is very slippery and it is hard for people to come up to the surface. To climb back up takes approx 60\u201390 minutes. There is some mobile phone signal within the crater, and the site receives very few visitors, even over weekends. As of April 2017, there has been upgrades to the park. A stone wall has been erected about 1/4 to 1/3 of the crater rim from the northwest to southwest. There is a mosque at the end of the entrance road. There are also upgraded picnic shelters around the rim.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Wahbah Crater Panorama.JPG|Panorama\nFile:Wahbah Crater Palm Trees.JPG|[[Palm tree]]s\nFile:Wahbah Crater Centre.png|Centre of the crater\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Saudi Arabia}}\n* [[List of volcanoes in Saudi Arabia]]\n* [[Sarawat Mountains|Sarat Mountains]]\n** [[Hijaz Mountains]]\n*** [[Harrat Rahat]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mekshat.com/vb/showthread.php?t=48059 Mekshat]\n* [http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0301-07= Global Volcanism Program]\n* [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/maqla-tamia-9b01cd11cdd64d8b8d7aef67b8203a64 3D model of the crater]\n\n{{coord|22|54|0|N|41|8|20|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Mountains in the Arabian Peninsula}}\n\n[[Category:Maars]]\n[[Category:Volcanoes of Saudi Arabia]]\n[[Category:Hejaz]]\n", "name_user": "209.206.97.197", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eOrigins)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Wahbah_crater"}

Both the prison-probation review and the Comprehensive Spending Review should result in steps which should improve public confidence in community penalties.\"<ref>Annual report 1998/1999, paragraph 13.15</ref>\n\nThe Home Office Prison-Probation review consultation paper<ref>Prison- Probation Review: Home Office (August 1998)</ref> did not mention family court welfare given that family court welfare was to move to a new unified family court welfare service.<ref>Support Services in Family Proceedings \u2013 Future Organisation of Court Welfare Services (Department of Health, Home Office, Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department, Welsh Office) (July 1998): Consultation closed on 13 November 1998.</ref>\n\nThe government then announced the setting up of a a unified family court welfare service.<ref>House of Lords 27 July 1999</ref> Among many key areas to be addressed were ensuring: Cafcass's statutory basis; funding to cover start-up, transitional and ongoing costs; change management of the merger of 114 autonomous bodies into a single organisation; maintenance of current casework. These were addressed by a project team,<ref> drawn from the three relevant government departments and supplemented by consultants dealing with, for example, IT, payroll, estates and finance.</ref>\n\nThe Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill<ref>Presented to the House of Commons on 15 March 2000.</ref> was led by the Home Office as most of the Bill\u2019s provisions concerned the establishment of a National Probation Service for England and Wales.

These standards set out what service users, partner agencies and practitioners in the family justice system could expect. The standards updated the 2003 Cafcass Service Standards and Principles, and after piloting in the North-East Region, were phased in from 1 April 2007. The standards noted the importance of service-user feedback and the active engagement and participation of children in their case planning process. Cafcass asserted the importance of including children's views in the decision making processes involved in court proceedings. Young people could offer a \"Needs, Wishes and Feelings\" statement directly to the judge. However, Cafcass admitted{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} that they do not conform to any National Standards.\n\nThe Children's Rights Team spearheaded the formation of a Young People's Board for Cafcass. This Board consists of 12 young people with experience of Cafcass's services. Since the Board's formation in August 2006 they helped to shape Cafcass policies and procedures.\n\nIn 2011 the Family Justice Review, in its final report, stated the following about the Young People\u2019s Board:\n\n\u2018''We have been impressed by the valuable work undertaken by the Cafcass Young People\u2019s Board. They provide an important perspective on the work of the family justice system and offer an intelligent and energetic challenge to the board of Cafcass. We believe that this work should be maintained through a Young People\u2019s Board for the Family Justice Service, with a remit to consider issues in both public and private law and to report directly to the service.\u2019''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217343/family-justice-review-final-report.pdf |title=Family Justice Review Final Report |date=November 2011 |website=www.gov.uk |accessdate=October 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102025004/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217343/family-justice-review-final-report.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nThe Young People\u2019s Board was expanded to cover the family justice system on a national scale and is now called The Family Justice Young People's Board.
