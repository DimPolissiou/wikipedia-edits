In 2003 the island voted in favour of [[secession]] from Guadeloupe in order to form a separate [[overseas collectivity]] (''collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer'', abbreviated to ''COM'') of France. The collectivity is one of four territories among the [[Leeward Islands]] in the northeastern [[Caribbean]] that comprise the [[French West Indies]], along with [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]], [[Guadeloupe]] ({{convert|200|km}} southeast), and [[Martinique]].\n\nSaint Barth\u00e9lemy, a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs, has an area of {{convert|25|km2}}<ref name=area/> and a population of about 10,000.<ref>Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques, France.</ref> Its [[Capital city|capital]] is [[Gustavia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Gustavia]],<ref name=cia>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tb.html |title=Saint Barthelemy: People and Society |date=13 September 2012|work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> which also contains the main harbour. It is the only Caribbean island that was a [[Swedish colony of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Swedish colony]] for any significant length of time; before the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Guadeloupe came under Swedish rule for nearly a century. Symbolism from the [[Coat of arms of Sweden|Swedish national arms]], the [[Three Crowns]], still appears in the island's coat of arms. The language, cuisine, and culture, however, are distinctly [[French culture|French]]. The island is a popular tourist destination during the winter holiday season, geared towards the high-end, luxury tourist market.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe island was not named by [[Christopher Columbus]] for his younger brother [[bartlemy Columbus]] in 1493.<ref name=Government/>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|French West Indies}}\n\n===Early period===\nBefore European contact the island was possibly frequented by Eastern Caribbean [[Ta\u00edno]] and [[Arawak]] people, who called the island 'Ouanalao',<ref name=\"wimco villa\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wimco.com/villa-rentals/caribbean/st-barthelemy/history.aspx |title=History of St. Barths Island |accessdate= 8 July 2019}}</ref> though it is believed that the island was not inhabited permanently due to its poor water sources and soil.<ref>There currently is not enough archeological evidence to give a more detailed description about the pre-Columbian presence; see Sebastiaan Knippenberg, 'Much To Choose From: The Use and Distribution of Siliceous Stone in the Lesser Antilles' in [[Corinne Hofman|Corinne L.

A 1994 survey has revealed several hundred indigenous species of plants including the naturalized varieties of flora; some growing in irrigated areas while the dry areas are dominated by the cacti variety. [[Coccoloba uvifera|Sea grapes]] and [[palm tree]]s are a common sight with [[mangrove]]s and [[shrub]]s surviving in the saline coastal swamps.

The Reserve includes the bays of Grand Cul de Sac, Colombier, Marigot, Petit Cul de Sac, Petite Anse as well as waters around offshore rocks such as Les Gross Islets, Pain de Sucre, Tortue and Forchue. The Reserve is designed to protect the islands coral reefs, seagrass and endangered marine species including sea turtles. The Reserve has two levels of protection, the yellow zones of protection where certain non-extractive activities, like snorkeling and boating, are allowed and the red zones of high protection where most activities including SCUBA are restricted in order to protect or recover marine life. Anchoring is prohibited in the Reserve and mooring buoys are in place in some of the protected bays like Colombier.\n\n== Landmarks and architecture ==\nAs well as Gustavia, the capital of St. Barth\u00e9lemy, there are many notable places and monuments in the island which testify to the island's colonial history under the Spanish, Swedish, British and French, and now a French territory.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\">Sullivan, pp. 170\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Gustavia===\n[[File:Gustavia Harbor, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.jpg|thumb|Gustavia Harbour]]\n\nGustavia is in a U-shaped cove facing the harbour on the west.

Earlier to their occupation, the port was known as \"Car\u00e9nage\". The Swedes renamed it as Gustavia in honour of their king [[Gustav III]]. It was then their prime trading center. The port maintained a neutral stance since the Caribbean war was on in the 18th century. They used it as trading post of contraband and the city of [[Gustavia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Gustavia]] prospered but this prosperity was short lived.<ref name=Introduction/>\n\nThese buildings also underwent further destruction during the hurricanes and also by gutting in 1852. However, some monuments are still intact such as the residence of the then Swedish governor, now the town hall{{Verify source|date=January 2011}}. The oldest colonial structure in the town is stated to be the bell tower (now without a bell) built in 1799, as part of a church (destroyed in the past), in the southeast end of the town on Rue Du Presbytere.

They are categorized and divided into two groups, the leeward side (calm waters protected by the island itself) and windward side (some of which are protected by hills and reefs). The windward beaches are popular for windsurfing. The beach of St Jean is suitable for water sports and facilities have been created for that purpose.

Anse de Flamands is a very wide sandy beach and Le petit Anse (The little beach), just to the north of Anse de Flamands is very safe and popular with the locals for their children. Anse Toiny beach is in a remote location and is considered suitable for experienced surfers as the water current is very strong.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.177-178\"/>\n\nOn the leeward side, the notable beaches are: Anse du Gouverneur, Anse du Colombier that is only accessible by foot or by boat, Anse de Grand Galet (Shell Beach) and Anse de Grande Saline which is popular with nudists. The area around the salt ponds near the Anse de Grande Saline beach is marshy and is a habitat for tropical birds.

The Reserve includes the bays of Grand Cul de Sac, Colombier, Marigot, Petit Cul de Sac, Petite Anse as well as waters around offshore rocks such as Les Gross Islets, Pain de Sucre, Tortue and Forchue. The Reserve is designed to protect the islands coral reefs, seagrass and endangered marine species including sea turtles. The Reserve has two levels of protection, the yellow zones of protection where certain non-extractive activities, like snorkeling and boating, are allowed and the red zones of high protection where most activities including SCUBA are restricted in order to protect or recover marine life. Anchoring is prohibited in the Reserve and mooring buoys are in place in some of the protected bays like Colombier.\n\n== Landmarks and architecture ==\nAs well as Gustavia, the capital of St. Barth\u00e9lemy, there are many notable places and monuments in the island which testify to the island's colonial history under the Spanish, Swedish, British and French, and now a French territory.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\">Sullivan, pp. 170\u2013173</ref>\n\n===Gustavia===\n[[File:Gustavia Harbor, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy.jpg|thumb|Gustavia Harbour]]\n\nGustavia is in a U-shaped cove facing the harbour on the west.

Earlier to their occupation, the port was known as \"Car\u00e9nage\". The Swedes renamed it as Gustavia in honour of their king [[Gustav III]]. It was then their prime trading center. The port maintained a neutral stance since the Caribbean war was on in the 18th century. They used it as trading post of contraband and the city of [[Gustavia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Gustavia]] prospered but this prosperity was short lived.<ref name=Introduction/>\n\nThese buildings also underwent further destruction during the hurricanes and also by gutting in 1852. However, some monuments are still intact such as the residence of the then Swedish governor, now the town hall{{Verify source|date=January 2011}}. The oldest colonial structure in the town is stated to be the bell tower (now without a bell) built in 1799, as part of a church (destroyed in the past), in the southeast end of the town on Rue Du Presbytere. Now, a large clock is installed in place of the bell.<ref name=\"Sullivan, p.170-173\"/>\n\nThe road that runs parallel to the harbour face of the sea called the Rue de la Republique and two other roads connect to the two arms of the U-shaped bay.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]].

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]].

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books.

Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Like most professional authors at the time, Fitzgerald supplemented his income by writing short stories for such magazines as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', and ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'', and sold his stories and novels to Hollywood studios. This \"whoring\", as Fitzgerald and, subsequently, Hemingway called these sales,<ref name=MoveableFeast1>Hemingway, Ernest \u2013 ''A Moveable Feast'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1964.</ref> was a sore point in the two authors' friendship.

After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: \"They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination.\"<ref>\n{{cite book |last = Milford |first = Nancy |author-link= Nancy Milford |date= 1970|title= Zelda: A Biography  |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NqlaAAAAMAAJ |location=New York |publisher= [[Harper & Row]] |pp=108\u2013112 |isbn= 1-57003-455-9}}</ref> In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', Hemingway claimed that Zelda taunted Fitzgerald over the [[Human penis size|size of his penis]].

Fitzgerald tried to continue working on his fourth novel, but by this point it had become clear that Zelda had an extreme mental illness as her behavior grew increasingly erratic. By 1930 she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. Fitzgerald had her treated at [[Prangins clinic]] in [[Switzerland]] They returned to America in September 1931.<ref name=\"life_of_fitzgerald\"/> But once again, February 1932, she was hospitalized at the Phipps Clinic at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/baltimore/baltimore_f_scott_fitzgerald_in_baltimore/|title = F.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

Scott and Zelda moved into a studio-owned bungalow in January of the following year and Fitzgerald soon met and began an affair with [[Lois Moran]]. The starlet became a temporary muse for the author and he rewrote Rosemary Hoyt, one of the central characters in ''Tender is the Night''\u2014who had been a male in earlier drafts\u2014to closely mirror her.

Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Like most professional authors at the time, Fitzgerald supplemented his income by writing short stories for such magazines as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', and ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'', and sold his stories and novels to Hollywood studios. This \"whoring\", as Fitzgerald and, subsequently, Hemingway called these sales,<ref name=MoveableFeast1>Hemingway, Ernest \u2013 ''A Moveable Feast'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1964.</ref> was a sore point in the two authors' friendship.

After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: \"They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination.\"<ref>\n{{cite book |last = Milford |first = Nancy |author-link= Nancy Milford |date= 1970|title= Zelda: A Biography  |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NqlaAAAAMAAJ |location=New York |publisher= [[Harper & Row]] |pp=108\u2013112 |isbn= 1-57003-455-9}}</ref> In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', Hemingway claimed that Zelda taunted Fitzgerald over the [[Human penis size|size of his penis]].

Fitzgerald tried to continue working on his fourth novel, but by this point it had become clear that Zelda had an extreme mental illness as her behavior grew increasingly erratic. By 1930 she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. Fitzgerald had her treated at [[Prangins clinic]] in [[Switzerland]] They returned to America in September 1931.<ref name=\"life_of_fitzgerald\"/> But once again, February 1932, she was hospitalized at the Phipps Clinic at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/baltimore/baltimore_f_scott_fitzgerald_in_baltimore/|title = F.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

Scott and Zelda moved into a studio-owned bungalow in January of the following year and Fitzgerald soon met and began an affair with [[Lois Moran]]. The starlet became a temporary muse for the author and he rewrote Rosemary Hoyt, one of the central characters in ''Tender is the Night''\u2014who had been a male in earlier drafts\u2014to closely mirror her.

His short story, ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', was the basis for a [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|2008 film]]. ''Tender Is the Night'' was the subject of the [[Tender Is the Night (film)|eponymous 1962 film]], and made into a television miniseries in 1985.

Another film, ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002) ([[Jeremy Irons]] plays Fitzgerald) describes the relationship of Fitzgerald and [[Frances Kroll Ring]] ([[Neve Campbell]]) during his last two years of life.  [[David Hoflin]] and [[Christina Ricci]] portrayed the Fitzgerald\u2019s in [[Amazon Prime]]'s 2015 television series ''[[Z: The Beginning of Everything]]''. Others include the TV movies ''[[Zelda (film)|Zelda]]'' (1993, with [[Timothy Hutton]]), ''F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'' (1976, with [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]]), and ''[[F.

[[Tom Hiddleston]] and [[Alison Pill]] appear briefly as Fitzgerald and Zelda in [[Woody Allen]]'s 2011 feature film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]''.

These legends can be entertainment, but often concern mysterious peril or troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects. They may also be moralistic confirmation of prejudices or ways to make sense of societal anxieties.<ref>{{cite|title = Urban Legend Definition| publisher = Snopes.com| url = https://www.snopes.com/what-are-urban-legends/|ref = none}}</ref>\n\nUrban legends are most often circulated orally, but can be spread by any media, including newspapers, [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations. Recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances: for instance, the common legend of a person being ambushed and anesthetized, only to wake up and realize that they are now missing a kidney that was supposedly [[organ theft|surgically removed]] for [[organ transplant|transplantation]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/robbery/kidney.asp|title=snopes.com:Kidney Thief|website=[[Snopes|Urban Legends Reference Pages]]|date=12 March 2008|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and structure ==\nThe term \"urban legend,\" as used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989, entry for \"urban legend,\" citing R. M. Dorson in T. P. Coffin, ''Our Living Traditions'', xiv. 166 (1968). See also William B. Edgerton, ''The Ghost in Search of Help for a Dying Man'', Journal of the Folklore Institute, Vol. 5, No. 1. pp. 31, 38, 41 (1968).</ref> [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], professor of English at the [[University of Utah]], introduced the term to the general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, ''[[The Vanishing Hitchhiker|The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends & Their Meanings]]'' (1981) to make two points: first, that [[legend]]s and [[folklore]] do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.\n\nMany urban legends are framed as complete [[fable|stories]] with [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[Fictional character|characters]]. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], fear or humor. Often they serve as [[cautionary tale]]s.<ref name=\"Epoch\"/> Some urban legends are [[moral|morality tales]] that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.<ref name=\"Epoch\">{{cite news |title=Urban legends: Modern morality tales |author=Elissa Michele Zacher |newspaper=[[The Epoch Times]] |date=18 July 2010 |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |accessdate=29 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724140443/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nUrban legends will often try to invoke a feeling of [[disgust]] in the reader which tends to make these stories more memorable and potent.

While at least one classic legend, the \"Death Car\", has been shown to have some basis in fact,<ref>Richard Dorson. \"American Folklore\" University of Chicago Press, 1959, pp. 250-52.</ref> folklorists have an interest in debunking those narratives only to the degree that establishing non-factuality warrants the assumption that there must be some other reason why the tales are told, re-told and believed.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Adam Brooke Davis. \"[http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm Davis, Adam Brooke. \"Devil's Night and Hallowe'en: The Linked Fates of Two Folk Festivals.\" Missouri Folklore Society Journal XXIV(2002) 69-82] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305105514/http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm |date= 2016-03-05 }}</ref> As in the case of [[myth]], the narratives are believed because they construct and reinforce the [[worldview]] of the group within which they are told, or \"because they provide us with coherent and convincing explanations of complex events\".<ref>John Mosier \"WAR MYTHS\" Historically Speaking: The Bulletin of the Historical Society: VI: 4, March/April 2005.</ref>\n\nSocial scientists have started to draw on urban legends in order to help explain complex socio-psychological beliefs, such as attitudes to [[crime]], [[childcare]], [[fast food]], [[SUVs]] and other \"family\" choices.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Croft |first= Robin |year= 2006 |title= Folklore, Families and Fear: Exploring the Influence of the Oral Tradition on Consumer Decision-making |journal= Journal of Marketing Management |volume= 22 |issue= 9 & 10 |pages= 1053\u20131076 |url= |doi= 10.1362/026725706778935574}}</ref> The authors make an explicit connection between urban legends and popular folklore, such as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', where similar themes and motifs arise. For that reason, it is characteristic of groups within which a given narrative circulates to react very negatively to claims or demonstrations of non-factuality; an example would be the expressions of outrage by police officers who are told that adulteration of Halloween treats by strangers (the subject of periodic [[moral panic]]s) occurs extremely rarely, if at all.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Best\n| first1                = Joel\n| author-link1          = Joel Best\n| last2                 = Horiuchi\n| first2                = Gerald T.\n| title                 = The Razor Blade in the Apple: The Social Construction of Urban Legends \n| journal               = Social Problems\n| date      = June 1985\n| volume                = 32\n| issue                 = 5\n| pages                 = 488\u2013497\n| issn                  = 0037-7791\n| doi                = 10.2307/800777\n| jstor                = 800777\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Documenting==\nThe [[Internet]] has made it easier both to spread and to debunk urban legends.<ref>Donovan, p.129</ref> For instance, the [[Usenet]] newsgroup ''alt.folklore.urban'' and several other websites, most notably [[snopes.com]], focus on discussing, tracking, and analyzing urban legends.

These legends can be entertainment, but often concern mysterious peril or troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects. They may also be moralistic confirmation of prejudices or ways to make sense of societal anxieties.<ref>{{cite|title = Urban Legend Definition| publisher = Snopes.com| url = https://www.snopes.com/what-are-urban-legends/|ref = none}}</ref>\n\nUrban legends are most often circulated orally, but can be spread by any media, including newspapers, [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations. Recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances: for instance, the common legend of a person being ambushed and anesthetized, only to wake up and realize that they are now missing a kidney that was supposedly [[organ theft|surgically removed]] for [[organ transplant|transplantation]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/robbery/kidney.asp|title=snopes.com:Kidney Thief|website=[[Snopes|Urban Legends Reference Pages]]|date=12 March 2008|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and structure ==\nThe term \"urban legend,\" as used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989, entry for \"urban legend,\" citing R. M. Dorson in T. P. Coffin, ''Our Living Traditions'', xiv. 166 (1968). See also William B.

Brunvand used his collection of legends, ''[[The Vanishing Hitchhiker|The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends & Their Meanings]]'' (1981) to make two points: first, that [[legend]]s and [[folklore]] do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.\n\nMany urban legends are framed as complete [[fable|stories]] with [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[Fictional character|characters]]. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], fear or humor. Often they serve as [[cautionary tale]]s.<ref name=\"Epoch\"/> Some urban legends are [[moral|morality tales]] that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.<ref name=\"Epoch\">{{cite news |title=Urban legends: Modern morality tales |author=Elissa Michele Zacher |newspaper=[[The Epoch Times]] |date=18 July 2010 |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |accessdate=29 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724140443/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nUrban legends will often try to invoke a feeling of [[disgust]] in the reader which tends to make these stories more memorable and potent.

On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n==== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ====\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that there was a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons.
