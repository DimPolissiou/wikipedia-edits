Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"[[reinforcement learning]]\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a \"[[reward function]]\".}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"[[fitness function]]\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.<ref>Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S., & Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125\u2013152.</ref>\n\nAI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n# If someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,\n# if a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,\n# take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,\n# if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,\n# take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,\n# take any empty square.\n\nMany AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = P.

A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial \"[[neurons]]\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}}<!-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one --><ref>{{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swan theory|black swans]] exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"[[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]]\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\n\n[[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]]\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations.

For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieto|first=Antonio|date=May 2018|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possible developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref>\n\nThe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\" />\n\n=== Reasoning, problem solving ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction --><!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/> In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/>\n\n=== Knowledge representation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |archivedate=29 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge<ref name=\"Ontology\"/> by acting as mediators between [[Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist-sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n;Breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/>\n;Subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n=== Planning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future\u2014a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it\u2014and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n=== Learning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,<ref>[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]], which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.<ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". [[Computational learning theory]] can assess learners by [[computational complexity]], by [[sample complexity]] (how much data is required), or by other notions of [[optimization theory|optimization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=M.

Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis \"Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125047/http://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis |date=1 February 2016 }}, Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119\u2013142, 2011\n</ref> and [[machine translation]].<ref name=\"Applications of natural language processing\"/> Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to [[sentiment analysis|assess the sentiment]] of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cambria|first1=Erik|last2=White|first2=Bebo|title=Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article]|journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=May 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48\u201357|doi=10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227}}</ref>\n\n=== Perception ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[File:\u00c4\u00e4retuvastuse n\u00e4ide.png|thumb|[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature detection]] (pictured: [[edge detection]]) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.]]\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world.

For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like [[machine translation]], require that a machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like machine translation is considered \"[[AI-complete]]\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n\n== Approaches ==\nThere is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.<ref>[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about\" {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.</ref> A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]]? Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/>\nCan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\n\n=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===\n{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n=== Symbolic ===\n{{Main|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n==== Cognitive simulation ====\nEconomist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s.<ref name=\"AI at CMU in the 60s\"/><ref name=\"Soar\"/>\n\n==== Logic-based ====\nUnlike Simon and Newell, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless whether people used the same algorithms.<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/> His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"AI at Stanford in the 60s\"/> Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].<ref name=\"AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s\"/>\n\n==== Anti-logic or scruffy ====\nResearchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])<ref name=\"AI at MIT in the 60s\"/> found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions\u2014they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]\" (as opposed to the \"[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]\" paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and Stanford).<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/> [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Cyc\"/>\n\n====Knowledge-based====\nWhen computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.<ref name=\"Knowledge revolution\"/> This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.<ref name=\"Expert systems\"/> A key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrate AI.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Frederick |first=Hayes-Roth |last2=William |first2=Murray |last3=Leonard |first3=Adelman |title=Expert systems|journal=AccessScience |language=en |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.248550}}</ref> The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\n\n=== Sub-symbolic ===\nBy the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/> Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\n\n==== Embodied intelligence ====\nThis includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]]. Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.<ref name=\"Embodied AI\"/> Their work revived the non-symbolic point of view of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n====Computational intelligence and soft computing====\nInterest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]]\u2014they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[Grey system theory]], [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n=== Statistical learning ===\nMuch of traditional [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|GOFAI]] got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to [[symbolic computation]] that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a \"victory of the neats\" may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]]. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=[[Science Magazine|Science]]|date=16 February 2018|pages=725\u2013726|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.359.6377.725|bibcode=2018Sci...359..725H}}</ref> Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.{{sfn|Norvig|2012}} Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from [[explainable AI]]. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}}\n\n=== Integrating the approaches ===\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works\u2014some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s:Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agent]]s in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are [[hybrid intelligent system]]s that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laird|first1=John|title=Extending the Soar cognitive architecture|journal=Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications|date=2008|volume=171|page=224|citeseerx=10.1.1.77.2473}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Lebiere|first2=Christian|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possibile developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Bhatt|first2=Mehul|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|last4=Vernon|first4=David|title=The role of cognitive architectures in general artificial intelligence|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=1\u20133|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.08.003|hdl=2318/1665249}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nAI has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n=== Search and optimization ===\n\n{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/> Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Merkle|author2=Martin Middendorf|editor1-last=Burke|editor1-first=Edmund K.|editor2-last=Kendall|editor2-first=Graham|title=Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6940-7|language=en|chapter=Swarm Intelligence}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\n\n{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research.

AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),{{efn|Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown [[latent variables]]{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=210}}}}<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be [[conditionally independent]] of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]) can require a sophisticated method such as [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]], which spreads an ensemble of [[random walk]]ers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on [[Xbox Live]] to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. [[Google AdSense|AdSense]] uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\n\n{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The [[decision tree learning|decision tree]]<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/> is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=88}} Other widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],{{efn|The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}}}<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM),{{efn|SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}}}<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/> and the extremely popular [[naive Bayes classifier]].{{efn|Naive Bayes is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}}}<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/> Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}\n\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nNeural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" ''N'' accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 \"[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]\" required \"only a few human assists\".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].

As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.{{sfn|O'Brien|Marakas|2011}}\n\nProposed \"universal intelligence\" tests aim to compare how well machines, humans, and even non-human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible.

If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|first=Nick|last=Bostrom|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|date=2015}}</ref>  In his book ''[[Human Compatible]]'', AI researcher [[Stuart J.

In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence.

Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature|journal=The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88\u2013100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}</ref> He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]' and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]]\u2014will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\n[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume= 2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219}} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link]\n</ref> The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain.\n\nFor example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it's red\". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else\u2014they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain.\n\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\n{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nComputationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.<ref>[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ \"The Computational Theory of Mind\"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main|Chinese room}}\nThe philosophical position that [[John Searle]] has named [[strong AI hypothesis|\"strong AI\"]] states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle's strong AI\"/> Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main|Robot rights}}\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''?

The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].<ref name=\"recurse\"/> The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans.

Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"[[reinforcement learning]]\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a \"[[reward function]]\".}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"[[fitness function]]\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.<ref>Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S., & Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125\u2013152.</ref>\n\nAI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n# If someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,\n# if a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,\n# take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,\n# if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,\n# take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,\n# take any empty square.\n\nMany AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = P.

A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial \"[[neurons]]\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}}<!-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one --><ref>{{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swan theory|black swans]] exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"[[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]]\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better.\n\n[[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]]\nSettling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Single pixel change fools AI programs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AI Has a Hallucination Problem That's Proving Tough to Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-has-a-hallucination-problem-thats-proving-tough-to-fix/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=WIRED|date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=1412.6572|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last2=Shlens|first2=Jonathon|last3=Szegedy|first3=Christian|title=Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples|class=stat.ML|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D\u00e9tection de personne - exemple 3.jpg|thumb|A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to match previous training images of pedestrians, and then model those areas as slow-moving but somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matti|first1=D.|last2=Ekenel|first2=H.

For instance, the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lieto|first=Antonio|date=May 2018|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possible developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref>\n\nThe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\" />\n\n=== Reasoning, problem solving ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction --><!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/> In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/>\n\n=== Knowledge representation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |archivedate=29 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge<ref name=\"Ontology\"/> by acting as mediators between [[Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist-sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n;Breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/>\n;Subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n=== Planning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future\u2014a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it\u2014and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n=== Learning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,<ref>[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]], which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.<ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". [[Computational learning theory]] can assess learners by [[computational complexity]], by [[sample complexity]] (how much data is required), or by other notions of [[optimization theory|optimization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=M.

A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural-language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis \"Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125047/http://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis |date=1 February 2016 }}, Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119\u2013142, 2011\n</ref> and [[machine translation]].<ref name=\"Applications of natural language processing\"/> Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to [[sentiment analysis|assess the sentiment]] of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cambria|first1=Erik|last2=White|first2=Bebo|title=Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article]|journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=May 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48\u201357|doi=10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227}}</ref>\n\n=== Perception ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[File:\u00c4\u00e4retuvastuse n\u00e4ide.png|thumb|[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature detection]] (pictured: [[edge detection]]) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.]]\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include [[speech recognition]],<ref name=\"Speech recognition\"/> [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], and [[object recognition]].<ref name=\"Object recognition\"/> [[Computer vision]] is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.<ref name=\"Computer vision\"/>\n\n=== Motion and manipulation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Robotics}}\n\nAI is heavily used in [[robotics]].<ref name=\"Robotics\"/> Advanced [[robotic arm]]s and other [[industrial robot]]s, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and [[robotic mapping|map]] its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in [[endoscopy]]) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge.

For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like [[machine translation]], require that a machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like machine translation is considered \"[[AI-complete]]\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n\n== Approaches ==\nThere is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.<ref>[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about\" {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.</ref> A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]]? Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/>\nCan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\n\n=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===\n{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n=== Symbolic ===\n{{Main|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level \"thinking\" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n==== Cognitive simulation ====\nEconomist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems.

A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/> Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\n\n==== Embodied intelligence ====\nThis includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]].

This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n====Computational intelligence and soft computing====\nInterest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]]\u2014they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[Grey system theory]], [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n=== Statistical learning ===\nMuch of traditional [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|GOFAI]] got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to [[symbolic computation]] that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a \"victory of the neats\" may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]]. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=[[Science Magazine|Science]]|date=16 February 2018|pages=725\u2013726|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.359.6377.725|bibcode=2018Sci...359..725H}}</ref> Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.{{sfn|Norvig|2012}} Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from [[explainable AI]]. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}}\n\n=== Integrating the approaches ===\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works\u2014some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s:Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agent]]s in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are [[hybrid intelligent system]]s that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laird|first1=John|title=Extending the Soar cognitive architecture|journal=Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications|date=2008|volume=171|page=224|citeseerx=10.1.1.77.2473}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Lebiere|first2=Christian|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|title=The knowledge level in cognitive architectures: Current limitations and possibile developments|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=39\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.05.001|hdl=2318/1665207}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Bhatt|first2=Mehul|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|last4=Vernon|first4=David|title=The role of cognitive architectures in general artificial intelligence|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=1\u20133|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.08.003|hdl=2318/1665249}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nAI has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n=== Search and optimization ===\n\n{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/> Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Merkle|author2=Martin Middendorf|editor1-last=Burke|editor1-first=Edmund K.|editor2-last=Kendall|editor2-first=Graham|title=Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6940-7|language=en|chapter=Swarm Intelligence}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\n\n{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic]]<ref name=\"Propositional logic\"/> involves [[truth function]]s such as \"or\" and \"not\". [[First-order logic]]<ref name=\"First-order logic\"/> adds [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy set theory]] assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. [[Fuzzy logic]] is successfully used in [[control system]]s to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.{{efn|\"There exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance... [We] independently confirm the inadequacy of systems for reasoning about uncertainty that propagates numerical factors according to only to which connectives appear in assertions.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elkan|first1=Charles|title=The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic|journal=IEEE Expert|date=1994|volume=9|issue=4|pages=3\u201349|doi=10.1109/64.336150|citeseerx=10.1.1.100.8402}}</ref>}}<ref name=\"Fuzzy logic\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=What is 'fuzzy logic'?

AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),{{efn|Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown [[latent variables]]{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=210}}}}<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be [[conditionally independent]] of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]) can require a sophisticated method such as [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]], which spreads an ensemble of [[random walk]]ers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on [[Xbox Live]] to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}. [[Google AdSense|AdSense]] uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\n\n{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The [[decision tree learning|decision tree]]<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/> is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=88}} Other widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],{{efn|The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}}}<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM),{{efn|SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}}}<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/> and the extremely popular [[naive Bayes classifier]].{{efn|Naive Bayes is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}}}<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/> Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}\n\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nNeural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" ''N'' accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The neural network forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 \"[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]\" required \"only a few human assists\".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].

A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test.

However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<ref>McFarland, Matt. \"Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more\".

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's\u2014one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\u2014it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting \"electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins\" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|first=Nick|last=Bostrom|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|date=2015}}</ref>  In his book ''[[Human Compatible]]'', AI researcher [[Stuart J.

''Moral Machines'', Oxford University Press.</ref> For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\"<ref>Wallach, pp 37\u201354.</ref> and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".<ref>Wallach, pp 55\u201373.</ref> For Wallach, the question is not centered on the issue of ''whether'' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the ''constraints'' which society may place on the development of AMAs.<ref>Wallach, Introduction chapter.</ref>\n\n==== Machine ethics ====\n{{Main|Machine ethics}}\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.</ref> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Machine Ethics |work=aaai.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}</ref> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"Machine Ethics\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n==== Malevolent and friendly AI ====\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\nPolitical scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature|journal=The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88\u2013100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}</ref> He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]' and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]]\u2014will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\n[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume= 2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219}} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link]\n</ref> The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain.\n\nFor example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it's red\". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else\u2014they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain.\n\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\n{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nComputationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.<ref>[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ \"The Computational Theory of Mind\"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main|Chinese room}}\nThe philosophical position that [[John Searle]] has named [[strong AI hypothesis|\"strong AI\"]] states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle's strong AI\"/> Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main|Robot rights}}\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? This issue, now known as \"[[robot rights]]\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.<ref name=\"Robot rights\"/> Some critics of [[transhumanism]] argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights. <ref Name=\"Evans 2015\">{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | journal = Teknokultura | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | date = 2015 | df = dmy-all | doi = 10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 }}</ref> The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug & Pray]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug & Pray Film \u2013 Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Robots -|author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212040134/http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and many sci fi media such as [[Star Trek]] Next Generation, with the character of [[Commander Data]], who fought being disassembled for research, and wanted to \"become human\", and the robotic holograms in Voyager.\n\n=== Superintelligence ===\n{{Main|Superintelligence}}\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines\u2014or human-machine hybrids\u2014can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ''Superintelligence'' may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n==== Technological singularity ====\n{{Main|Technological singularity|Moore's law}}\nIf research into [[artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].<ref name=\"recurse\"/> The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer [[Vernor Vinge]] named this scenario \"[[technological singularity|singularity]]\".<ref name=Singularity/> Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.<ref name=Singularity/><ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n[[Ray Kurzweil]] has used [[Moore's law]] (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that [[desktop computer]]s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.<ref name=Singularity/>\n\n==== Transhumanism ====\n{{Main|Transhumanism}}\n\nRobot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]] and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either.<ref name=\"Transhumanism\"/> This idea, called [[transhumanism]], has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]].\n\n[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s \"[[Darwin among the Machines]]\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.<ref name=\"AI as evolution\"/>\n\n== Economics ==\nThe long-term economic effects of AI are uncertain.

Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.\n\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer.

''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\".

Sigmundur introduced Christianity, forcing Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu to convert or face beheading and, although Sigmundur was subsequently murdered, Norwegian taxation was upheld. Norwegian control of the Faroes continued until 1814, although, when the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)]] entered the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark, it gradually resulted in Danish control of the islands. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] with [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Lutheranism|Evangelical Lutheranism]] and [[Reformed]] reached the Faroes in 1538. When the union between Denmark and Norway dissolved as a result of the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Denmark retained possession of the Faroe Islands; Norway itself was joined in a union with Sweden.\n\nFollowing the turmoil caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803-1815) in 1816, the Faroe Islands became a county in the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/publication_series/monographs/monographs/secession_and_counter_secession_an_international_relations_perspective|title=CIDOB - Secession and Counter-secession.

The overall character of the climate of the islands is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the [[North Atlantic Current]]. This, together with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0&nbsp;\u00b0C or 37 to 39&nbsp;\u00b0F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or 49 to 51&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe islands are windy, cloudy, and cool throughout the year with an average of 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. [[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever.

The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]].

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

According to official statistics from 2019, 79.7% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] (F\u00f3lkakirkjan), a form of [[Lutheranism]].<ref>[https://statbank.hagstova.fo/pxweb/en/H2/H2__MM__MM03/atrud_prgj.px/ Parishes, 1st January (2000-2019)] Statistics Faroe Islands</ref> The F\u00f3lkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007; previously it had been a diocese within the [[Church of Denmark]]. Faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] (1819\u20131909), [[Fr\u00ed\u00f0rikur Petersen]] (1853\u20131917) and, perhaps most significantly, [[J\u00e1kup Dahl]] (1878\u20131944), who had a great influence in ensuring that the [[Faroese language]] was spoken in the church instead of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Participation in churches is more prevalent among the Faroese population than among most other Scandinavians.\n\nIn the late 1820s, the Christian [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] religious movement, the [[Plymouth Brethren]], was established in England. In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later. In the period 1930 to 1940 a writer from the village Sk\u00e1lav\u00edk on Sandoy island, [[He\u00f0in Br\u00fa]], published three novels: ''Lognbr\u00e1'' (1930), ''Fastat\u00f8kur'' (1935) and ''Fe\u00f0gar \u00e1 fer\u00f0'' (English title: ''The old man and his sons'') (1940).

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Garments include sweaters, scarves, and gloves. Faroese jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations handed down from mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in Faroese knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This appears to be a reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''.

Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

Although today ''[[s\u00fdsla]]'' technically means \"police district\", the term is still commonly used to indicate a geographical region. In earlier times, each ''s\u00fdsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''v\u00e1rting'' (\"spring assembly\").\n\n=== Relationship with Denmark ===\n{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}\nThe Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]]. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the [[War in Donbass]] in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh [[salmon]] to Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/faeroe-islands-boom-by-selling-salmon-to-russia-1424483776|title=Faeroe Islands Boom by Selling Salmon to Russia|first=Anton|last=Troianovski|date=21 February 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Moreover, a [[special member state territories and the European Union#Faroe Islands|protocol]] to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with international organisations ===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

It is difficult to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.\n\nFaroese belongs to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of [[Indo-European languages]]. Written Faroese (grammar and vocabulary) is most similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to their ancestor [[Old Norse]], though the spoken language is closer to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects of [[Western Norway]]. Faroese is the first official language of the island while [[Danish language|Danish]], the second, is taught in schools and can be used by the Faroese government in public relations.<ref name=\"folang\"/>\n\nFaroese language policy provides for the active creation of new terms in Faroese suitable for modern life.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{main|Religion in the Faroe Islands}}\nAccording to the ''[[F\u00e6reyinga saga]]'', [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] brought Christianity to the islands in 999.

According to official statistics from 2019, 79.7% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] (F\u00f3lkakirkjan), following a form of [[Lutheranism]].<ref>[https://statbank.hagstova.fo/pxweb/en/H2/H2__MM__MM03/atrud_prgj.px/ Parishes, 1st January (2000-2019)] Statistics Faroe Islands</ref> The F\u00f3lkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007; previously it had been a diocese within the [[Church of Denmark]]. Faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] (1819\u20131909), [[Fr\u00ed\u00f0rikur Petersen]] (1853\u20131917) and, perhaps most significantly, [[J\u00e1kup Dahl]] (1878\u20131944), who had a great influence in ensuring that the [[Faroese language]] was spoken in the church instead of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Participation in churches is more prevalent among the Faroese population than among most other Scandinavians.\n\nIn the late 1820s, the Christian [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] religious movement, the [[Plymouth Brethren]], was established in England. In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later.

Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it.

[[B\u00e1r\u00f0ur Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006). Though not born in the Faroe Islands, Matthew Landrum an American poet and editor for the Structo magazine, has written a collection of poems about the Islands.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

However, fierce resistance by the local population and soldiers resulted in the failure of the Portuguese to permanently occupy the city, and the inhabitants who had fled to the interior would eventually return and rebuild the city. After Barawa, Trist\u00e3o would set sail for [[Mogadishu]], which was the richest city on the East African coast. But word had spread of what had happened in Barawa, and a large troop mobilization had taken place. Many horsemen, soldiers and battleships in defense positions were now guarding the city. Nevertheless, Trist\u00e3o still opted to storm and attempt to conquer the city, although every officer and soldier in his army opposed this, fearing certain defeat if they were to engage their opponents in battle.

The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\",<ref name=\"Rose, p. 95\">[[#Rose|Rose]], p. 95.</ref> as one historian has put it. [[Gibraltar]]'s location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.\n\nGibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by [[Neanderthal]]s and may have been one of their [[Neanderthals of Gibraltar|last places of habitation]] before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's [[recorded history]] began around 950 BC with the [[Phoenicians]], who lived nearby. The [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later worshipped [[Hercules]] in shrines said to have been built on the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which they called ''Mons Calpe'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=K|last2=Finlayson|first2=C|last3=Vagelpohl|first3=U|last4=Jose Giles Guzman|first4=F|last5=Giles Pacheco|first5=F|title=Myths, Moors and Holy War: Reassessing the History and Archaeology of Gibraltar and the Straits, ad 711\u20131462|journal=Medieval Archaeology|date=2014|volume=58|issue=1|pages=136\u2013161}}</ref> the \"Hollow Mountain\", and which they regarded as one of the twin [[Pillars of Hercules]].\n\nGibraltar became part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of [[Hispania]] following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] rule in 711 AD. It was [[Moorish Gibraltar|permanently settled for the first time]] by the Moors and was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'' \u2013 the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into ''Gibraltar''. The Christian [[Crown of Castile]] annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]] and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by an [[Kingdom of England|Anglo]]-[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet in the name of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Austria]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.\n\nSpain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a [[Crown colony]], through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Gibraltar became a major base in the [[Peninsular War]]. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to [[India]] via the [[Suez Canal]]. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.\n\nBritish control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the [[Second World War]]. It was attacked on several occasions by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General [[Francisco Franco]] declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to [[self-determination]]. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.\n\nSince 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on [[Tourism in Gibraltar|tourism]], financial services, [[Shipping in Gibraltar|shipping]] and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with [[Parliament of Gibraltar|its own parliament]] and [[Government of Gibraltar|government]], though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success had made it one of the wealthiest areas of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Geographical background==\n\n[[File:Gibraltar World Wind view annotated.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar, with key locations marked|Annotated satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar]]\nThe history of Gibraltar has been driven by its strategic position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at the eastern side of the [[Bay of Gibraltar]], {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from the city of [[Algeciras]]. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only {{convert|15|mi|order=flip}} from the coast of [[Morocco]] in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/> As one writer has put it, \"whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar.\"<ref>[[#Krieger|Krieger]], p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe territory's area measures only {{convert|2.6|sqmi|order=flip}}. Most of the land area is occupied by the steeply sloping Rock of Gibraltar which reaches a height of {{convert|426|m}}. The town of Gibraltar lies at the base of the Rock on the west side of the peninsula. A narrow, low-lying isthmus connects the peninsula to the Spanish mainland. The North Face of the Rock is a nearly vertical cliff {{convert|396|m}} high overlooking the isthmus; the only land access to the town is via a coastal strip about {{convert|350|m}} wide, which was considerably narrower before the [[Land reclamation|reclamation of land]] from the sea during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dennis\">[[#Dennis|Dennis]], pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's geography has thus given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It is virtually impossible to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around [[Europa Point]] is surrounded by cliffs which are up to {{convert|30|m}} high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Prehistory and ancient history}} Prehistory and ancient history==\n<!-- DO NOT change anchor without updating incoming link at: Original inhabitants of Gibraltar -->\n\n[[File:Neanderthal skull from Forbes' Quarry.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Three\u2014quarter view of the mostly intact skull of a Neanderthal female|\"[[Gibraltar 1|Gibraltar Woman]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 a Neanderthal who lived in Gibraltar some 50,000 years ago]]\n{{History of Gibraltar}}\nGibraltar's appearance in prehistory was very different.

It lacked easily accessible fresh water, fertile soil or a safe natural anchorage on the shoreline. Avienus cited the \"shallow draft and dense mud of the shore\" as reasons not to land there. Its geographical location, which later became its key strategic asset, was not a significant factor during the Classical period as the entrance to the Mediterranean was not contested by the states of the day.<ref name=\"Devenish-72\"/><ref name=Jackson-22>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons the ancients instead settled at the head of the bay in what is today known as the [[Campo de Gibraltar|''Campo'' (hinterland) of Gibraltar]].<ref name=Jackson-22/> The town of [[Carteia]], near the location of the modern Spanish town of [[San Roque, C\u00e1diz|San Roque]], was founded by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of the native [[Turdetani]] people.<ref>[[#Shields|Shields]], p. ix.</ref> The Carthaginians took control of the town by 228 BC and it was captured by the Romans in 206 BC.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins]], p. 106.</ref> It subsequently became [[Pompey]]'s western base in his campaign of 67 BC against the pirates that menaced the Mediterranean Sea at the time.<ref>[[#Truver|Truver]], p. 161.</ref> Carteia appears to have been abandoned after the [[Vandals]] sacked it in 409 AD during their march through Roman [[Hispania]] to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 18.</ref> The region subsequently fell under the rule of the Christianised [[Visigoths]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Moorish rule (711\u20131309, 1333\u20131462)==\n{{main|Moorish Gibraltar}}\n[[File:Tower of Homage Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A square tower with gardens in the foreground and a connecting wall on the right\u2014hand side|The 14th-century Tower of Homage, the largest surviving fragment of Gibraltar's [[Moorish Castle]]]]\nBy 681 the armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had expanded from their original homeland of [[Arabia]] to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The [[Berbers]] of North Africa, called [[Moors]] by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian [[Hispania]] and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into civil war in the 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.<ref name=\"Hills30\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"Jackson21-25\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 21\u201325.</ref>\n\nFollowing a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army under the command of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Gibraltar (though most likely not in the bay or at the Rock itself).<ref name=\"Hills30\"/><ref name=\"Jackson21-25\"/> Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula]], he ended his career in disgrace after falling out with the Arab general [[Musa bin Nusayr]].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 28.</ref> His conquest nonetheless left a long-lasting legacy for Gibraltar: ''Mons Calpe'' was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'', the Mount of Tariq, subsequently corrupted into ''Gibraltar''.<ref name=Hills-13/>\n\nGibraltar was fortified for the first time in 1160 by the [[Almohad]] Sultan [[Abd al-Mu'min]] in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of [[Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Gibraltar was renamed ''Jebel al-Fath'' (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist,<ref name=Hills-13/> and a fortified town named ''Medinat al-Fath'' (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nIn the late thirteen and early fourteenth centuries the [[Crown of Castile]] fought with the [[Marinids]] of Morocco and the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] of [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] for control of the Strait of Gibraltar. This conflict ({{lang-es|link=no|la Cuesti\u00f3n del Estrecho}}) is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of [[Tarifa]] in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] would lay siege to [[Algeciras]] (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the [[rearguard]] of Algeciras and provided a fallback position if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.<ref>[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 35.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to the test for the first time in the [[First Siege of Gibraltar]]. That year [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] and [[James II of Aragon]] joined forces to attack the Muslim [[Emirate of Granada]], targeting [[Almer\u00eda]] in the east and Algeciras, across the bay from Gibraltar, in the west.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 38.</ref> In July 1309 the Castilians laid siege to both [[Siege of Algeciras (1309\u20131310)|Algeciras]] and Gibraltar.

From the 16th century, the modern meaning of the name came to be adopted \u2013 specifically referring only to the town of Gibraltar and the peninsula on which it stands.<ref name=\"Devenish, p. 120\">[[#Devenish|Devenish]], p. 120.</ref>\n\nUnder Spanish Crown rule, the town of Gibraltar fell into severe decline. The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the southern ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from [[tuna]]-fishing and wine-producing industries but its usefulness as a fortress was now limited. It was effectively reduced to the status of an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and [[Marbella]] replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 17.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's inhospitable terrain made it an unpopular place to live.

In September 1506, following Isabella's death, he [[Tenth Siege of Gibraltar|laid siege]] in the expectation that the gates would quickly be opened to his forces. This did not happen, and after a fruitless four-month blockade he gave up the attempt.

[[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa took advantage of the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Europe]] was sacked and all its valuables were stolen. Many of the captives were subsequently released when a Spanish fleet commanded by [[Bernardino de Mendoza (Captain General)|Bernardino de Mendoza]] intercepted the pirate ships near [[Battle of Albor\u00e1n|Albor\u00e1n]] as they were bringing ransomed hostages back to Gibraltar. The Spanish crown belatedly responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the [[Charles V Wall]] to control the southern flank of the Rock and commissioning the Italian engineer [[Giovanni Battista Calvi]] to strengthen other parts of the fortifications.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe seas around Gibraltar continued to be dangerous for decades to come as Barbary pirate raids continued; although a small squadron of Spanish galleys was based at the port to counter pirate raids, it proved to be of limited effectiveness and many inhabitants were abducted and sold into slavery by the pirates. The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the [[Morisco]]s;\u2013 Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 78\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a fleet of ships showing one ship exploding in flames, with men and debris flying in the air and other men in the water, jumping overboard or taking to lifeboats |''The Explosion of the Spanish Flagship during the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]]'' by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]] ]]\nThe threat of the Barbary pirates was soon joined by that of Spain's enemies in northern Europe. On 5 May 1607, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet under Admiral [[Jacob van Heemskerk]] ambushed a Spanish fleet at anchor in the Bay of Gibraltar. The Dutch won an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]], losing no ships and very few men while the entire Spanish fleet was destroyed with the loss of 3,000 men.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 80.</ref> The Spanish and Dutch declared a temporary truce in 1609 (the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]) and resumed hostilities in 1621, when a joint Dutch and Danish fleet arrived in the Strait to attack Spanish shipping.

The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts. Some in England had ambitions to turn the fleet against Spain rather than the Barbary coast. However, [[James VI and I|James I]] successfully resisted [[Parliament of England|Parliamentary]] pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England.<ref name=\"Jackson-81\"/> After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to \"take or spoil a town\" on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that it was small, could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked [[C\u00e1diz]] in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but [[C\u00e1diz Expedition (1625)|the raid]] turned into a fiasco. The landing force looted the town's wine stores and was evacuated after four days of mass drunkenness without anything useful having been achieved.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe presence of Spain's enemies in the Straits prompted the Spanish king [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] to order Gibraltar's defences to be strengthened. A new [[South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|mole]] and gun platforms were built, though the latter's usefulness was limited due to a lack of gunners. The town was an unsanitary, crowded place, which probably contributed to the outbreak in 1649 of an epidemic&nbsp;\u2013 reportedly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] but possibly [[typhoid fever|typhoid]]&nbsp;\u2013 which killed a quarter of the population.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 84.</ref> English fleets returned to Gibraltar in 1651\u201352 and again in 1654\u201355 as temporary allies of the Spanish against French and Dutch shipping in the Straits.<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 86\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar in 1654 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Gibraltar'', 1654 by [[Jan Peeters I]]]]\nIn 1654, [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to turn on Spain (which had been the first state to recognise the [[Commonwealth of England]]) and seize the island of [[Hispaniola]] to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over [[Jamaica]] instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off C\u00e1diz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u201360)|war on England]] until February 1656.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref> Shortly afterwards, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar.

The dispute over who should succeed him&nbsp;\u2013 the Bourbon Prince [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], grandson of [[Louis XIV of France]], or the Habsburg Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Austria]]&nbsp;\u2013 soon plunged Europe into a major war. Louis XIV supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, [[Portugal]], Savoy and some of the German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the [[barrier town]]s. In May 1702, England's [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] formally declared war on France.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 89\u201391.</ref>\n\nSpain thus became a target for the Anglo-Dutch-Austrian alliance.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 91.</ref> The confederates' campaign was pursued by land and by sea. The main land offensive was pursued in the [[Low Countries]] by the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], while naval forces under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke harassed French and Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces would launch a surprise attack against the French and their [[Bavaria]]n allies in the [[Danube]] basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 92.</ref> Rooke was instructed to attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 93.</ref>\n\nWhen Rooke arrived in the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the inhabitants of [[Barcelona]] to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at [[Toulon]] was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take [[Battle of C\u00e1diz (1702)|C\u00e1diz]] had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[Capture of Gibraltar|The attack]] was launched on 1 August 1704 as a combined operation between the naval force under Rooke's command and a force of Dutch and English marines under the command of [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and Captain [[Edward Whitaker]] of [[HMS Dorsetshire (1694)|HMS ''Dorsetshire'']].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 96.</ref> After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 97.</ref> Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned.

The inhabitants and garrison of Gibraltar were promised freedom of religion and the maintenance of existing rights if they wished to stay, on condition that they swore an oath of loyalty to Charles as King of Spain. As had happened two years previously in the raid on C\u00e1diz, the discipline of the landing forces soon broke down. There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned|Cathedral]]) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of [[Our Lady of Europe]] were damaged and destroyed.

They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the \"City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo\".

Shrimpton was replaced in 1707 by Colonel [[Roger Elliott]], who was replaced in turn by Brigadier [[Thomas Stanwix]] in 1711; this time the appointments were made directly by London with no claim of authority from Charles. Stanwix was ordered to expel all foreign troops from Gibraltar to secure its status as an exclusively British possession but failed to evict the Dutch, apparently not considering them \"foreign\".<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession was finally settled in 1713 by a series of treaties and agreements. Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the [[Southern Netherlands]], [[Naples]], Milan, and [[Sardinia]] to Austria; [[Sicily]] and some Milanese lands to [[Savoy]]; and [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish [[history of slavery|slave trading]] in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called ''[[asiento]]''. With regard to Gibraltar ([[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]]), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain \"for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.\" The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113, 333\u2013334.</ref><ref name=\"Abulafia2011 497\">[[#Abulafia|Abulafia]], p. 47.</ref>\n\n==British rule (1713\u2013present)==\n\n===Consolidation and sieges===\nDespite its later importance to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by the British Government as more of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset.

The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the [[Armada of 1779]].

The night before the Grand Attack on 27 November 1781, the British garrison filed silently out of their defence works and made a surprise [[sortie]], routing the besieging infantry in their trenches and postponed the grand assault on The Rock for some time.\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138<ref>Monti, p. 140.</ref> heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels<ref name=\"Monti p138\">Monti, p. 138.</ref> with a total of 30,000 sailors and marines.

The British destroyed three of the floating batteries,<ref>Montero, pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish.

The following evening a gale blew up, scattering the Spanish and French fleet and allowing Howe to sail unopposed into Gibraltar. A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport ships which delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000<ref>Syrett, p. 104\u2013105.</ref><ref>Chartrand, p. 23.</ref> Howe then sailed out and fought [[Battle of Cape Spartel|an indecisive battle]] with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.\n\nThe siege was continued for some months longer, but in the spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted.  The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] warned that it would be the source \"of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity\" and expressed his wish \"if possible to be rid of Gibraltar&nbsp;... I shall not think peace complete if we do not get rid of Gibraltar.\" General Eliott and the garrison were lauded for their heroism, and the tenacity of their defence of Gibraltar acquired, as one writer puts it, \"a sort of cult status\".<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref> The British public acquired \"an emotional, albeit irrational, attachment to the place.\"<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 10.</ref> The reputed impregnability of Gibraltar gave rise to the expression, which is still current today, of something being as \"strong as the Rock of Gibraltar\".<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar as a colony===\nFollowing the Great Siege, the civilian population of Gibraltar&nbsp;\u2013 which had fallen to under a thousand&nbsp;\u2013 expanded rapidly as the territory became both a place of economic opportunity and a refuge from the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Britain's loss of North American colonies in 1776 led to much of her trade being redirected to new markets in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]]. The favoured route to the east was via [[Egypt]], even before the [[Suez Canal]] had been built, and Gibraltar was the first British port reached by ships heading there. The new maritime traffic gave Gibraltar a greatly increased role as a trading port. At the same time, it was a haven in the western Mediterranean from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. Many of the new immigrants were Genoese people who had fled Napoleon's annexation of the old [[Republic of Genoa]].<ref name=\"Jackson-181\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 181.</ref> By 1813 nearly a third of the population consisted of Genoese and Italians. Portuguese made up another 20 per cent, Spaniards 16.5 per cent, Jews 15.5 per cent, British 13 per cent and Menorcans 4 per cent. The young [[Benjamin Disraeli]] described the inhabitants of Gibraltar as a mixture of \"Moors with costumes as radiant as a rainbow or Eastern melodrama, Jews with [[gaberdine]]s and skull-caps, Genoese, Highlanders and Spanish.\"<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 159\u2013160.</ref> The inhabitants had a clear pecking order, with British officers at the top and Jews at the bottom.

In July 1801 a French and Spanish naval force fought the two [[Algeciras Campaign|Battles of Algeciras]] off Gibraltar, which ended in disaster for the Spanish when two of their largest warships each mistook the other for the enemy, engaged each other, collided, caught fire and exploded, killing nearly 2,000 Spanish sailors.<ref name=\"Jackson-192\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 192.</ref> Two years later Gibraltar served as a base for Lord Nelson in his efforts to bring the French Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] to battle, which culminated in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in which Nelson was killed and Villeneuve captured.<ref name=\"Jackson-199\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 199.</ref> Nelson sailed to Gibraltar in June 1803 to launch the [[Trafalgar Campaign]] and oversee the blockades against France and Spain, though he spent little time ashore.<ref name=\"Jackson-195\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 195.</ref> On 28 October 1805, a week after the Battle of Trafalgar, the badly damaged [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] returned to Gibraltar with Nelson's body aboard;<ref name=\"Jackson-200\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 200.</ref> [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Admiral Collingwood]]'s dispatch to General Fox, announcing the victory and Nelson's death, was printed in the pages of the ''[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]''.

The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding [[St Bernard's Hospital]] to serve the civilian population and initiating the construction of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 162.</ref> A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a [[Crown colony]]. In the same year, the [[Gibraltar Police Force]] was established, modelled on London's pioneering [[Metropolitan Police Service]],<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 163.</ref> and [[Court system of Gibraltar|a Supreme Court]] was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.<ref name=\"Jackson-229\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 229.</ref>\n\nThe economic importance of Gibraltar changed following the invention of [[steamboat|steamships]]; the first one to reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 166.</ref> The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to [[Alexandria]] or [[Cape Horn]], the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until near the end of the century.<ref name=\"Jackson-242\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 242.</ref> The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La L\u00ednea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 381.</ref>\n[[File:Frederick Leeds Edridge 1833 Castle Street.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a street scene showing people and pack animals going up and down a steep street, with several women wearing the traditional red cloak of Gibraltar|Castle Street, Gibraltar, by [[Frederick Leeds Edridge]], 1833]]\nVisiting Gibraltar in the mid-19th century, the English writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]] wrote in his ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain|Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'' that \"the differences of nations and costumes are very curious: a motley masquerade is held in this halfway house between Europe, Asia, and Africa, where every man appears in his own dress and speaks his own language.

The problem arose after Spain imposed tariffs on foreign manufactured goods in a bid to protect Spain's own fledgling industrial enterprises. Tobacco was also heavily taxed, providing one of the government's principal sources of revenue. The inevitable result was that Gibraltar, where cheap tobacco and goods were readily available, became a centre of intensive smuggling activity.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 172.</ref> The depressed state of the economy caused smuggling to become a mainstay of Gibraltar's trade;<ref name=\"Jackson-242\"/> the mid-19th-century Irish traveller Martin Haverty described Gibraltar as \"the grand smuggling depot for Spain\".<ref name=\"Haverty-219\"/> General Sir [[Robert Gardiner (British Army officer)|Robert Gardiner]], who served as Governor between 1848 and 1855, described the daily scene in a letter to British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]:\n\n{{quote|From the first early opening of the gates there is to be seen a stream of Spanish men, women and children, horses and a few caleches, passing into the town where they remain moving about from shop to shop until about noon.

The emergence of the Gibraltarians as a distinct group owed much to the pressure on housing in the territory and the need to control the numbers of the civilian population, as Gibraltar was still first and foremost a military fortress. Two [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] of 1873 and 1885 stipulated that no child of alien parent could be born in Gibraltar, no foreigners could claim a right of residence and that only Gibraltar-born inhabitants were entitled to reside there; everyone else needed permits, unless they were employees of the British Crown. In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions.<ref name=\"Jackson-248\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 248.</ref> There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.<ref name=\"Jackson-249\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar at war and peace===\n[[File:Gibraltar Harbour scene, February 1909.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A fleet of warships lined up in a harbour with thick clouds of smoke coming out of their funnels|The United States' [[Great White Fleet]] visiting Gibraltar harbour in February 1909]]\nBy the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of [[torpedo]]es meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 255.</ref> The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.<ref name=\"Bradford-169\">[[#Bradford|Bradford]], p. 169.</ref>\n\nA Spanish proposal to swap Gibraltar for [[Ceuta]] on the other side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected.<ref name=\"Quiroga\">[[#Quiroga|Quiroga]], page 39</ref> It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side.

Only a few minutes after the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day.<ref name=\"Hills-398\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 398.</ref> Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war \u2013 Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested as it was in the Second World War&nbsp;\u2013 it played an important role in the Allied fight against the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]]. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait.<ref name=\"Jackson-264\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 264.</ref> Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, [[SM UB-50|SM ''UB-50'']] torpedoed and sank the British [[battleship]] [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']] off [[Cape Trafalgar]] to the west of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-265\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of peace inevitably meant a reduction in military expenditure, but this was more than offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from [[India]] and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.<ref name=\"Jackson-268\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially on the front lines of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General [[Francisco Franco]] broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the [[Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Spanish Republican]] government sought on several occasions to regain control of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]]-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption.

The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when [[Battle of France|Germany invaded France]], with [[Italian invasion of France|Italy joining the invasion]] in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and it was decided to [[evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar]] in May 1940.<ref name=\"Jackson-271\"/> Most went to the United Kingdom and others to [[Madeira]] and [[Jamaica]], while some made their own way to [[Tangier]] and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over {{convert|30|miles|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called [[Force H]] was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Jackson-276\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 276.</ref> The airfield, which was now designated [[RAF North Front]], was also extended using soil from the tunnelling works so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa.<ref name=\"Jackson-286\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 286.</ref> The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 293.</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar played a key role. The [[Convoy#World War II|Ocean Convoy System]] adopted by Britain after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 ran on two routes \u2013 an east\u2013west route between the UK and North America, and a north\u2013south route between the UK, Gibraltar and [[Freetown]] in British-ruled [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>[[#Grove|Grove]], p. 30.</ref> Even before the war, Gibraltar had been designated as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe.<ref>[[#Baptiste|Baptiste]], p. 7.</ref> From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region.<ref>[[#Offley|Offley]], p. 371.</ref> A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Morison|Morison]], p. 250.</ref>\n\nGibraltar was directly attacked, both overtly and covertly, on several occasions during the war. [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant.<ref name=\"Jackson-281\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 281.</ref> Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to \"non-belligerence\",<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 11.</ref> which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory. Despite Franco's willingness to overlook German and Italian activities in and around the Bay of Gibraltar, he decided not to join Hitler's planned [[Operation Felix]] to seize the territory.<ref name=\"Jacksonpp\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 282\u201383.</ref> A major factor influencing his decision was the vulnerability of Spain's food supplies, as the country was unable to feed itself after the destruction of the Civil War.

The Italians repeatedly carried out raids on Gibraltar's harbour using [[human torpedo]]es and divers operating from the Spanish shore, damaging a number of merchant ships and sinking one.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 286\u201387.</ref> Three Spaniards being run as spies and saboteurs by the German [[Abwehr]] were caught in Gibraltar in 1942\u201343 and [[capital punishment in Gibraltar|hanged]].<ref name=\"Jackson-293\"/> The threat to Gibraltar was greatly reduced after the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|collapse of Italy]] in September 1943.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\"/>\n\n===Post-war Gibraltar===\n[[File:Gibraltar Parliament 2.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A long plaza with a large two\u2014storey pink building at the far end, with a flight of steps leading up to the building's triple\u2014arched entrance framed with columns.|The Gibraltar House of Assembly (now the Gibraltar Parliament), established in 1969]]\nAlthough Gibraltar's civilian inhabitants had started to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after [[VJ Day]] was a lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to the southern end of the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.<ref name=\"Jackson-296\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 296.</ref>\n\nIn the war's aftermath, Gibraltar took decisive steps towards implementing civilian self-governance over most issues of public policy. The [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR), led by Gibraltarian lawyer [[Joshua Hassan]], won all of the seats in the first post-war City Council elections in 1945. Women were given the right to vote in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was established.<ref name=\"Alexander-235\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 235.</ref> A two-party system had emerged by 1955 with the creation of the [[Commonwealth Party (Gibraltar)|Commonwealth Party]] as a rival to the AACR. That same year Hassan became the first Mayor of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-236\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 236.</ref> The Governor still retained overall authority and could overrule the Legislative Council. This inevitably caused tension and controversy if the Governor and Legislative Council disagreed, but in 1964 the British Government agreed to confine the powers of the Governor to matters of defence, security and foreign relations.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 237.</ref> A new constitution was decided on in 1968 and promulgated in 1969, merging the City Council and Legislative Council into a single House of Assembly (known as the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] since 2006) with 15 elected members, two non-elected officials and a speaker. The old title of \"Colony of Gibraltar\" was dropped and the territory was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 241.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's post-war relationship with Spain was marred by an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted to use military force to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hills-375\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 375.</ref> The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about {{convert|1|km}} wide&nbsp;\u2013 the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control of most of the neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-250\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar border 1977.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two women standing at a closed line of gates, with the British and Spanish flags flying on separate poles on either side.|The closed gates at the border between Gibraltar and Spain, 1977]]\nSpain's push to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar was fuelled by the [[decolonization|decolonisation]] agenda of the United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other \"Overseas Dependent Territories\" in conjunction with the drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence.<ref name=\"Jackson-303\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 303.</ref> Franco's government calculated that Britain would be willing to give up an expensive possession that no longer had a great deal of military value,<ref name=\"Jackson-294\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 294.</ref> but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-295\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 295.</ref> The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|a referendum in September 1967]] in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain with just 44 supporting union with Spain, though a further 55 voting slips were blank or invalid.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\"/> Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants \"pseudo-Gibraltarians\"<ref name=\"Jackson-306\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 306.</ref> and stating that the \"real\" Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\"/>\n\nThe dispute initially took the form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-300\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 300.</ref> Further restrictions were imposed in 1964,<ref name=\"Jackson-308\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 308.</ref> and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles.  The following year, Spain closed its airspace to aircraft taking off or landing at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]. In 1969, after the passing of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969|Gibraltar Constitution Order]], to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.<ref name=\"Jackson-316\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 316.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish decision had major consequences not only for the political relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom, but\nfor the people of Gibraltar, many of whom had relatives or homes in Spain. As one of the Gibraltarians who suffered the closure of the frontier explains:\n\n{{quote|The saddest sight was seeing people behind the wire fences on both sides of the land frontier yelling at the top of their voices across the wide dividing space to enquire about the state of relatives, as telephone communications had been cut by the Spaniards. Local housewives with Spanish relatives in the Campo area kept their radios tuned to the nearby Spanish stations for news of family members who were gravely ill. In critical cases the parties concerned would rush to Spain via Tangiers but unfortunately sometimes the patient was dead and buried by the time they arrived. The Spanish authorities would not allow access across the land frontier even on compassionate grounds.<ref>[[#Levey|Levey]], p. 35.</ref>}}\n\nFranco's death in 1975 led to the beginnings of diplomatic movement between Britain and Spain on the Gibraltar issue, though not immediately.

To facilitate the territory's economic expansion, a major programme of land reclamation was carried out; a tenth of Gibraltar's present-day land area was reclaimed from the sea.

The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\",<ref name=\"Rose, p. 95\">[[#Rose|Rose]], p. 95.</ref> as one historian has put it. [[Gibraltar]]'s location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.\n\nGibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by [[Neanderthal]]s and may have been one of their [[Neanderthals of Gibraltar|last places of habitation]] before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's [[recorded history]] began around 950 BC with the [[Phoenicians]], who lived nearby. The [[Carthaginians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later worshipped [[Hercules]] in shrines said to have been built on the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which they called ''Mons Calpe'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=K|last2=Finlayson|first2=C|last3=Vagelpohl|first3=U|last4=Jose Giles Guzman|first4=F|last5=Giles Pacheco|first5=F|title=Myths, Moors and Holy War: Reassessing the History and Archaeology of Gibraltar and the Straits, ad 711\u20131462|journal=Medieval Archaeology|date=2014|volume=58|issue=1|pages=136\u2013161}}</ref> the \"Hollow Mountain\", and which they regarded as one of the twin [[Pillars of Hercules]].\n\nGibraltar became part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of [[Hispania]] following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim [[Moors|Moorish]] rule in 711 AD. It was [[Moorish Gibraltar|permanently settled for the first time]] by the Moors and was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'' \u2013 the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into ''Gibraltar''. The Christian [[Crown of Castile]] annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]] and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] by an [[Kingdom of England|Anglo]]-[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet in the name of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Austria]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.\n\nSpain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a [[Crown colony]], through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Gibraltar became a major base in the [[Peninsular War]]. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to [[India]] via the [[Suez Canal]]. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.\n\nBritish control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the [[Second World War]]. It was attacked on several occasions by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General [[Francisco Franco]] declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to [[self-determination]]. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.\n\nSince 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on [[Tourism in Gibraltar|tourism]], financial services, [[Shipping in Gibraltar|shipping]] and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with [[Parliament of Gibraltar|its own parliament]] and [[Government of Gibraltar|government]], though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success had made it one of the wealthiest areas of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Geographical background==\n\n[[File:Gibraltar World Wind view annotated.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar, with key locations marked|Annotated satellite view of the Strait of Gibraltar]]\nThe history of Gibraltar has been driven by its strategic position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at the eastern side of the [[Bay of Gibraltar]], {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from the city of [[Algeciras]]. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only {{convert|15|mi|order=flip}} from the coast of [[Morocco]] in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/> As one writer has put it, \"whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar.\"<ref>[[#Krieger|Krieger]], p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe territory's area measures only {{convert|2.6|sqmi|order=flip}}. Most of the land area is occupied by the steeply sloping Rock of Gibraltar which reaches a height of {{convert|426|m}}. The town of Gibraltar lies at the base of the Rock on the west side of the peninsula. A narrow, low-lying isthmus connects the peninsula to the Spanish mainland. The North Face of the Rock is a nearly vertical cliff {{convert|396|m}} high overlooking the isthmus; the only land access to the town is via a coastal strip about {{convert|350|m}} wide, which was considerably narrower before the [[Land reclamation|reclamation of land]] from the sea during the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dennis\">[[#Dennis|Dennis]], pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's geography has thus given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It is virtually impossible to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around [[Europa Point]] is surrounded by cliffs which are up to {{convert|30|m}} high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.<ref name=\"Dennis\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|Prehistory and ancient history}} Prehistory and ancient history==\n<!-- DO NOT change anchor without updating incoming link at: Original inhabitants of Gibraltar -->\n\n[[File:Neanderthal skull from Forbes' Quarry.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Three\u2014quarter view of the mostly intact skull of a Neanderthal female|\"[[Gibraltar 1|Gibraltar Woman]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 a Neanderthal who lived in Gibraltar some 50,000 years ago]]\n{{History of Gibraltar}}\nGibraltar's appearance in prehistory was very different.

It lacked easily accessible fresh water, fertile soil or a safe natural anchorage on the shoreline. Avienus cited the \"shallow draft and dense mud of the shore\" as reasons not to land there. Its geographical location, which later became its key strategic asset, was not a significant factor during the Classical period as the entrance to the Mediterranean was not contested by the states of the day.<ref name=\"Devenish-72\"/><ref name=Jackson-22>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor these reasons the ancients instead settled at the head of the bay in what is today known as the [[Campo de Gibraltar|''Campo'' (hinterland) of Gibraltar]].<ref name=Jackson-22/> The town of [[Carteia]], near the location of the modern Spanish town of [[San Roque, C\u00e1diz|San Roque]], was founded by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of the native [[Turdetani]] people.<ref>[[#Shields|Shields]], p. ix.</ref> The Carthaginians took control of the town by 228 BC and it was captured by the Romans in 206 BC.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins]], p. 106.</ref> It subsequently became [[Pompey]]'s western base in his campaign of 67 BC against the pirates that menaced the Mediterranean Sea at the time.<ref>[[#Truver|Truver]], p. 161.</ref> Carteia appears to have been abandoned after the [[Vandals]] sacked it in 409 AD during their march through Roman [[Hispania]] to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 18.</ref> The region subsequently fell under the rule of the Christianised [[Visigoths]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Moorish rule (711\u20131309, 1333\u20131462)==\n{{main|Moorish Gibraltar}}\n[[File:Tower of Homage Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A square tower with gardens in the foreground and a connecting wall on the right\u2014hand side|The 14th-century Tower of Homage, the largest surviving fragment of Gibraltar's [[Moorish Castle]]]]\nBy 681 the armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had expanded from their original homeland of [[Arabia]] to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The [[Berbers]] of North Africa, called [[Moors]] by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian [[Hispania]] and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into civil war in the 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.<ref name=\"Hills30\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"Jackson21-25\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 21\u201325.</ref>\n\nFollowing a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army under the command of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Gibraltar (though most likely not in the bay or at the Rock itself).<ref name=\"Hills30\"/><ref name=\"Jackson21-25\"/> Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula]], he ended his career in disgrace after falling out with the Arab general [[Musa bin Nusayr]].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 28.</ref> His conquest nonetheless left a long-lasting legacy for Gibraltar: ''Mons Calpe'' was renamed ''Jebel Tariq'', the Mount of Tariq, subsequently corrupted into ''Gibraltar''.<ref name=Hills-13/>\n\nGibraltar was fortified for the first time in 1160 by the [[Almohad]] Sultan [[Abd al-Mu'min]] in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of [[Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Gibraltar was renamed ''Jebel al-Fath'' (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist,<ref name=Hills-13/> and a fortified town named ''Medinat al-Fath'' (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\nIn the late thirteen and early fourteenth centuries the [[Crown of Castile]] fought with the [[Marinids]] of Morocco and the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] of [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] for control of the Strait of Gibraltar. This conflict ({{lang-es|link=no|la Cuesti\u00f3n del Estrecho}}) is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of [[Tarifa]] in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] would lay siege to [[Algeciras]] (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the [[rearguard]] of Algeciras and provided a fallback position if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.<ref>[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 35.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to the test for the first time in the [[First Siege of Gibraltar]]. That year [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] and [[James II of Aragon]] joined forces to attack the Muslim [[Emirate of Granada]], targeting [[Almer\u00eda]] in the east and Algeciras, across the bay from Gibraltar, in the west.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 38.</ref> In July 1309 the Castilians laid siege to both [[Siege of Algeciras (1309\u20131310)|Algeciras]] and Gibraltar.

They proved unequal to the task of keeping out the Castilians and Gibraltar's Nasrid defenders surrendered after a month.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 39\u201340.</ref> Ferdinand gave up the siege of Algeciras the following February but held on to Gibraltar, expelling the Moors and repopulating it with Christians.

In the Royal Warrant accompanying the arms, Isabella highlighted Gibraltar's importance as \"the key between these our kingdoms in the Eastern and Western Seas [the Mediterranean and Atlantic]\". The metaphor was represented on the royal arms by a golden key hanging from the front gate of a battlemented fortress.

To the east, Gibraltar was bounded by the [[Guadiaro River]], and its northern boundaries lay in the vicinity of [[Castellar de la Frontera]], [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[Alcal\u00e1 de los Gazules]], [[Medina-Sidonia]] and [[Tarifa, Spain|Tarifa]].

The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the southern ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from [[tuna]]-fishing and wine-producing industries but its usefulness as a fortress was now limited. It was effectively reduced to the status of an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and [[Marbella]] replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 17.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's inhospitable terrain made it an unpopular place to live.

In September 1506, following Isabella's death, he [[Tenth Siege of Gibraltar|laid siege]] in the expectation that the gates would quickly be opened to his forces. This did not happen, and after a fruitless four-month blockade he gave up the attempt.

[[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa took advantage of the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Europe]] was sacked and all its valuables were stolen. Many of the captives were subsequently released when a Spanish fleet commanded by [[Bernardino de Mendoza (Captain General)|Bernardino de Mendoza]] intercepted the pirate ships near [[Battle of Albor\u00e1n|Albor\u00e1n]] as they were bringing ransomed hostages back to Gibraltar. The Spanish crown belatedly responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the [[Charles V Wall]] to control the southern flank of the Rock and commissioning the Italian engineer [[Giovanni Battista Calvi]] to strengthen other parts of the fortifications.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nThe seas around Gibraltar continued to be dangerous for decades to come as Barbary pirate raids continued; although a small squadron of Spanish galleys was based at the port to counter pirate raids, it proved to be of limited effectiveness and many inhabitants were abducted and sold into slavery by the pirates. The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the [[Morisco]]s;\u2013 Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as [[Cornwall]].<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 78\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 78.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Gibraltar 1607.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a fleet of ships showing one ship exploding in flames, with men and debris flying in the air and other men in the water, jumping overboard or taking to lifeboats |''The Explosion of the Spanish Flagship during the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]]'' by [[Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen]] ]]\nThe threat of the Barbary pirates was soon joined by that of Spain's enemies in northern Europe. On 5 May 1607, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] fleet under Admiral [[Jacob van Heemskerk]] ambushed a Spanish fleet at anchor in the Bay of Gibraltar.

The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts. Some in England had ambitions to turn the fleet against Spain rather than the Barbary coast. However, [[James VI and I|James I]] successfully resisted [[Parliament of England|Parliamentary]] pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England.<ref name=\"Jackson-81\"/> After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to \"take or spoil a town\" on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that it was small, could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked [[C\u00e1diz]] in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but [[C\u00e1diz Expedition (1625)|the raid]] turned into a fiasco. The landing force looted the town's wine stores and was evacuated after four days of mass drunkenness without anything useful having been achieved.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe presence of Spain's enemies in the Straits prompted the Spanish king [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] to order Gibraltar's defences to be strengthened. A new [[South Mole, Gibraltar Harbour|mole]] and gun platforms were built, though the latter's usefulness was limited due to a lack of gunners. The town was an unsanitary, crowded place, which probably contributed to the outbreak in 1649 of an epidemic&nbsp;\u2013 reportedly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] but possibly [[typhoid fever|typhoid]]&nbsp;\u2013 which killed a quarter of the population.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 84.</ref> English fleets returned to Gibraltar in 1651\u201352 and again in 1654\u201355 as temporary allies of the Spanish against French and Dutch shipping in the Straits.<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 86\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar in 1654 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Gibraltar'', 1654 by [[Jan Peeters I]]]]\nIn 1654, [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to turn on Spain (which had been the first state to recognise the [[Commonwealth of England]]) and seize the island of [[Hispaniola]] to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over [[Jamaica]] instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off C\u00e1diz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u201360)|war on England]] until February 1656.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref> Shortly afterwards, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar.

The dispute over who should succeed him&nbsp;\u2013 the Bourbon Prince [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], grandson of [[Louis XIV of France]], or the Habsburg Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Austria]]&nbsp;\u2013 soon plunged Europe into a major war. Louis XIV supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, [[Portugal]], Savoy and some of the German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the [[barrier town]]s. In May 1702, England's [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] formally declared war on France.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 89\u201391.</ref>\n\nSpain thus became a target for the Anglo-Dutch-Austrian alliance.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 91.</ref> The confederates' campaign was pursued by land and by sea. The main land offensive was pursued in the [[Low Countries]] by the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], while naval forces under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke harassed French and Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces would launch a surprise attack against the French and their [[Bavaria]]n allies in the [[Danube]] basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 92.</ref> Rooke was instructed to attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 93.</ref>\n\nWhen Rooke arrived in the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the inhabitants of [[Barcelona]] to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at [[Toulon]] was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take [[Battle of C\u00e1diz (1702)|C\u00e1diz]] had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 94.</ref>\n\n[[Capture of Gibraltar|The attack]] was launched on 1 August 1704 as a combined operation between the naval force under Rooke's command and a force of Dutch and English marines under the command of [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]] and Captain [[Edward Whitaker]] of [[HMS Dorsetshire (1694)|HMS ''Dorsetshire'']].<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 96.</ref> After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 97.</ref> Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned.

The inhabitants and garrison of Gibraltar were promised freedom of religion and the maintenance of existing rights if they wished to stay, on condition that they swore an oath of loyalty to Charles as King of Spain. As had happened two years previously in the raid on C\u00e1diz, the discipline of the landing forces soon broke down. There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the [[Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned|Cathedral]]) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of [[Our Lady of Europe]] were damaged and destroyed.

They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the \"City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo\".

Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the [[Southern Netherlands]], [[Naples]], Milan, and [[Sardinia]] to Austria; [[Sicily]] and some Milanese lands to [[Savoy]]; and [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish [[history of slavery|slave trading]] in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called ''[[asiento]]''. With regard to Gibraltar ([[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]]), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain \"for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.\" The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 113, 333\u2013334.</ref><ref name=\"Abulafia2011 497\">[[#Abulafia|Abulafia]], p. 47.</ref>\n\n==British rule (1713\u2013present)==\n\n===Consolidation and sieges===\nDespite its later importance to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by the British Government as more of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset.

Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across the upper end of the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as ''La L\u00ednea de Contravalaci\u00f3n'' (the Lines of [[Investment (military)|Contravallation]]), were later to give their name to the modern town of [[La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n]].<ref name=\"Jackson-139\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 139.</ref> Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.<ref name=\"Jackson-140\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 140.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's civilian population increased steadily through the century to form a disparate mixture of Britons, Genoese, Jews, Spaniards and Portuguese.

The driving force behind this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) [[William Green (general)|William Green]], who was to play a key role a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-147\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 147\u2013149.</ref> He was joined in 1776 by Lieutenant General [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Augustus Elliott]], a veteran of earlier wars against France and Spain who took over the governorship of Gibraltar at a key moment.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 150.</ref>\n\nBritain's successes in the [[Seven Years' War]] had left it with expensive commitments in the Americas that had to be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] led to the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|started the Anglo-Spanish War]] and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.<ref name=\"Jackson-150\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest [[siege]]s endured by the [[British Armed Forces]], as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history.  A combined Spanish and French fleet [[blockade]]d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing [[fortification|forts]], [[redoubt]]s, [[trench warfare|entrenchments]], and [[artillery battery|batteries]] from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the [[Armada of 1779]].  The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral George Rodney]] captured a [[Action of 8 January 1780|Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre]] and defeated a Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies.\n\nThe British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low.  On 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral [[George Darby]]'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England laden for Gibraltar entered the bay. The Spanish fleet was unable to intercept Darby's relief. The Spanish, frustrated by this failure, began a barrage of the town, causing great panic and terror among the civilian population.<ref name=\"Bradford1972_gs\">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Ernle Dusgate Selby |date=1972 |title=Gibraltar: the history of a fortress |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-UjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=16 April 2011}} ''To the citizen of the 20th Century, accustomed or the civilian casualties in war, and dulled to the annihilation of whole cities (or even nations), the horrified reaction of Gibraltar's garrison to the shelling of the town and its inhabitants may seem a trifle na\u00efve. But it must be remembered that in those days there was still a code of conduct in warfare, and some elementary humanity in those who waged it.''.</ref> Deliberate targeting of civilians was unprecedented at the time and was to continue for 2 years, obliterating any architectural heritage from the Spanish period.  Unable to starve the garrison out, the French and Spanish attempted further attacks by land and sea. The night before the Grand Attack on 27 November 1781, the British garrison filed silently out of their defence works and made a surprise [[sortie]], routing the besieging infantry in their trenches and postponed the grand assault on The Rock for some time.\n\nOn 13 September 1782 the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon allies]] launched their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '[[Floating battery|floating batteries]]' with 138<ref>Monti, p. 140.</ref> heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels<ref name=\"Monti p138\">Monti, p. 138.</ref> with a total of 30,000 sailors and marines.

The British destroyed three of the floating batteries,<ref>Montero, pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish.

The following evening a gale blew up, scattering the Spanish and French fleet and allowing Howe to sail unopposed into Gibraltar. A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport ships which delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th]], [[59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|59th]], and [[97th Regiment of Foot (1780)|97th]] regiments of foot bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000<ref>Syrett, p. 104\u2013105.</ref><ref>Chartrand, p. 23.</ref> Howe then sailed out and fought [[Battle of Cape Spartel|an indecisive battle]] with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.\n\nThe siege was continued for some months longer, but in the spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted.  The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] warned that it would be the source \"of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity\" and expressed his wish \"if possible to be rid of Gibraltar&nbsp;... I shall not think peace complete if we do not get rid of Gibraltar.\" General Eliott and the garrison were lauded for their heroism, and the tenacity of their defence of Gibraltar acquired, as one writer puts it, \"a sort of cult status\".<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref> The British public acquired \"an emotional, albeit irrational, attachment to the place.\"<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 10.</ref> The reputed impregnability of Gibraltar gave rise to the expression, which is still current today, of something being as \"strong as the Rock of Gibraltar\".<ref>[[#Finlayson|Fa, Finlayson]], p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar as a colony===\nFollowing the Great Siege, the civilian population of Gibraltar&nbsp;\u2013 which had fallen to under a thousand&nbsp;\u2013 expanded rapidly as the territory became both a place of economic opportunity and a refuge from the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Britain's loss of North American colonies in 1776 led to much of her trade being redirected to new markets in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]]. The favoured route to the east was via [[Egypt]], even before the [[Suez Canal]] had been built, and Gibraltar was the first British port reached by ships heading there. The new maritime traffic gave Gibraltar a greatly increased role as a trading port. At the same time, it was a haven in the western Mediterranean from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. Many of the new immigrants were Genoese people who had fled Napoleon's annexation of the old [[Republic of Genoa]].<ref name=\"Jackson-181\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 181.</ref> By 1813 nearly a third of the population consisted of Genoese and Italians. Portuguese made up another 20 per cent, Spaniards 16.5 per cent, Jews 15.5 per cent, British 13 per cent and Menorcans 4 per cent. The young [[Benjamin Disraeli]] described the inhabitants of Gibraltar as a mixture of \"Moors with costumes as radiant as a rainbow or Eastern melodrama, Jews with [[gaberdine]]s and skull-caps, Genoese, Highlanders and Spanish.\"<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 159\u2013160.</ref> The inhabitants had a clear pecking order, with British officers at the top and Jews at the bottom.

The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding [[St Bernard's Hospital]] to serve the civilian population and initiating the construction of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 162.</ref> A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a [[Crown colony]]. In the same year, the [[Gibraltar Police Force]] was established, modelled on London's pioneering [[Metropolitan Police Service]],<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 163.</ref> and [[Court system of Gibraltar|a Supreme Court]] was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.<ref name=\"Jackson-229\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 229.</ref>\n\nThe economic importance of Gibraltar changed following the invention of [[steamboat|steamships]]; the first one to reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823.<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 166.</ref> The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to [[Alexandria]] or [[Cape Horn]], the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until near the end of the century.<ref name=\"Jackson-242\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 242.</ref> The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La L\u00ednea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.<ref>[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 381.</ref>\n[[File:Frederick Leeds Edridge 1833 Castle Street.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a street scene showing people and pack animals going up and down a steep street, with several women wearing the traditional red cloak of Gibraltar|Castle Street, Gibraltar, by [[Frederick Leeds Edridge]], 1833]]\nVisiting Gibraltar in the mid-19th century, the English writer [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]] wrote in his ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain|Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'' that \"the differences of nations and costumes are very curious: a motley masquerade is held in this halfway house between Europe, Asia, and Africa, where every man appears in his own dress and speaks his own language.

In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions.<ref name=\"Jackson-248\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 248.</ref> There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.<ref name=\"Jackson-249\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 249.</ref>\n\n===Gibraltar at war and peace===\n[[File:Gibraltar Harbour scene, February 1909.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A fleet of warships lined up in a harbour with thick clouds of smoke coming out of their funnels|The United States' [[Great White Fleet]] visiting Gibraltar harbour in February 1909]]\nBy the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of [[torpedo]]es meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 255.</ref> The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.<ref name=\"Bradford-169\">[[#Bradford|Bradford]], p. 169.</ref>\n\nA Spanish proposal to swap Gibraltar for [[Ceuta]] on the other side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected.<ref name=\"Quiroga\">[[#Quiroga|Quiroga]], page 39</ref> It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side. From 1889, the [[Royal Navy]] was greatly expanded and both Gibraltar and Malta were equipped with new, torpedo-proof harbours and expanded, modernised dockyards.<ref name=\"Jackson-256\"/> The works at Gibraltar were carried out by some 2,200 men at the huge cost of \u00a35&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.005|1898|2013|r=1}}}}&nbsp;billion in 2013 prices).<ref name=\"Jackson-257\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 257.</ref> Under the reforming leadership of [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John \"Jacky\" Fisher]], Gibraltar became the base for the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]].<ref>[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 189.</ref> In the British public's imagination, Gibraltar was seen as \"a symbol of British naval power [and] a symbol of the empire which has been built and, more than the British lion or even [[John Bull]] himself, has come to represent Britain's power and prestige across the world.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Gibraltar \u2013 Vital Point in War|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NIkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2378,24256&dq=windmill-hill+gibraltar&hl=en|work=The Vancouver Sun|page=4|date=1 August 1940}}</ref>\n\nThe value of the naval base was soon apparent when the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Only a few minutes after the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day.<ref name=\"Hills-398\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 398.</ref> Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war \u2013 Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested as it was in the Second World War&nbsp;\u2013 it played an important role in the Allied fight against the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]]. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait.<ref name=\"Jackson-264\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 264.</ref> Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, [[SM UB-50|SM ''UB-50'']] torpedoed and sank the British [[battleship]] [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']] off [[Cape Trafalgar]] to the west of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-265\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe restoration of peace inevitably meant a reduction in military expenditure, but this was more than offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from [[India]] and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.<ref name=\"Jackson-268\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially on the front lines of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General [[Francisco Franco]] broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the [[Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939)|Spanish Republican]] government sought on several occasions to regain control of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]]-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding.<ref name=\"Stockey-93\">[[#Stockey|Stockey]], p. 93.</ref><ref name=\"Alexander206\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 206.</ref> A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain.

On one hand, the British authorities, the Anglican and Catholic churches and the Gibraltarian moneyed class supported the Nationalists in the War, while the working class sided with the Republicans.<ref>[[#Stockey|Stockey]], pp. 92, 99\u2013103.</ref> With Europe sliding towards a general war, the British Government decided to strengthen Gibraltar's defences and upgrade the naval base to accommodate the latest generation of battleships and aircraft carriers.

The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when [[Battle of France|Germany invaded France]], with [[Italian invasion of France|Italy joining the invasion]] in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and it was decided to [[evacuation of the Gibraltarian civilian population during World War II|evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar]] in May 1940.<ref name=\"Jackson-271\"/> Most went to the United Kingdom and others to [[Madeira]] and [[Jamaica]], while some made their own way to [[Tangier]] and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over {{convert|30|miles|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called [[Force H]] was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Jackson-276\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 276.</ref> The airfield, which was now designated [[RAF North Front]], was also extended using soil from the tunnelling works so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa.<ref name=\"Jackson-286\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 286.</ref> The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 293.</ref>\n\nDuring the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar played a key role. The [[Convoy#World War II|Ocean Convoy System]] adopted by Britain after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 ran on two routes \u2013 an east\u2013west route between the UK and North America, and a north\u2013south route between the UK, Gibraltar and [[Freetown]] in British-ruled [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>[[#Grove|Grove]], p. 30.</ref> Even before the war, Gibraltar had been designated as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe.<ref>[[#Baptiste|Baptiste]], p. 7.</ref> From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region.<ref>[[#Offley|Offley]], p. 371.</ref> A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.<ref>[[#Morison|Morison]], p. 250.</ref>\n\nGibraltar was directly attacked, both overtly and covertly, on several occasions during the war. [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant.<ref name=\"Jackson-281\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 281.</ref> Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to \"non-belligerence\",<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 11.</ref> which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory. Despite Franco's willingness to overlook German and Italian activities in and around the Bay of Gibraltar, he decided not to join Hitler's planned [[Operation Felix]] to seize the territory.<ref name=\"Jacksonpp\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 282\u201383.</ref> A major factor influencing his decision was the vulnerability of Spain's food supplies, as the country was unable to feed itself after the destruction of the Civil War.

The Italians repeatedly carried out raids on Gibraltar's harbour using [[human torpedo]]es and divers operating from the Spanish shore, damaging a number of merchant ships and sinking one.<ref>[[#Jackson|Jackson]], pp. 286\u201387.</ref> Three Spaniards being run as spies and saboteurs by the German [[Abwehr]] were caught in Gibraltar in 1942\u201343 and [[capital punishment in Gibraltar|hanged]].<ref name=\"Jackson-293\"/> The threat to Gibraltar was greatly reduced after the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|collapse of Italy]] in September 1943.<ref name=\"Jackson-293\"/>\n\n===Post-war Gibraltar===\n[[File:Gibraltar Parliament 2.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A long plaza with a large two\u2014storey pink building at the far end, with a flight of steps leading up to the building's triple\u2014arched entrance framed with columns.|The Gibraltar House of Assembly (now the Gibraltar Parliament), established in 1969]]\nAlthough Gibraltar's civilian inhabitants had started to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after [[VJ Day]] was a lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to the southern end of the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.<ref name=\"Jackson-296\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 296.</ref>\n\nIn the war's aftermath, Gibraltar took decisive steps towards implementing civilian self-governance over most issues of public policy. The [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR), led by Gibraltarian lawyer [[Joshua Hassan]], won all of the seats in the first post-war City Council elections in 1945. Women were given the right to vote in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was established.<ref name=\"Alexander-235\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 235.</ref> A two-party system had emerged by 1955 with the creation of the [[Commonwealth Party (Gibraltar)|Commonwealth Party]] as a rival to the AACR. That same year Hassan became the first Mayor of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-236\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 236.</ref> The Governor still retained overall authority and could overrule the Legislative Council. This inevitably caused tension and controversy if the Governor and Legislative Council disagreed, but in 1964 the British Government agreed to confine the powers of the Governor to matters of defence, security and foreign relations.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 237.</ref> A new constitution was decided on in 1968 and promulgated in 1969, merging the City Council and Legislative Council into a single House of Assembly (known as the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] since 2006) with 15 elected members, two non-elected officials and a speaker. The old title of \"Colony of Gibraltar\" was dropped and the territory was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\">[[#Alexander|Alexander]], p. 241.</ref>\n\nGibraltar's post-war relationship with Spain was marred by an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted to use military force to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hills-375\">[[#Hills|Hills]], p. 375.</ref> The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about {{convert|1|km}} wide&nbsp;\u2013 the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control of most of the neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-250\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gibraltar border 1977.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two women standing at a closed line of gates, with the British and Spanish flags flying on separate poles on either side.|The closed gates at the border between Gibraltar and Spain, 1977]]\nSpain's push to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar was fuelled by the [[decolonization|decolonisation]] agenda of the United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other \"Overseas Dependent Territories\" in conjunction with the drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence.<ref name=\"Jackson-303\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 303.</ref> Franco's government calculated that Britain would be willing to give up an expensive possession that no longer had a great deal of military value,<ref name=\"Jackson-294\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 294.</ref> but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain.<ref name=\"Jackson-295\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 295.</ref> The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised [[1967 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|a referendum in September 1967]] in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain and only 44 supported union with Spain.<ref name=\"Alexander-241\"/> Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants \"pseudo-Gibraltarians\"<ref name=\"Jackson-306\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 306.</ref> and stating that the \"real\" Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.<ref name=\"Alexander-237\"/>\n\nThe dispute initially took the form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Jackson-300\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 300.</ref> Further restrictions were imposed in 1964,<ref name=\"Jackson-308\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 308.</ref> and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles.  The following year, Spain closed its airspace to aircraft taking off or landing at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]. In 1969, after the passing of the [[Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969|Gibraltar Constitution Order]], to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.<ref name=\"Jackson-316\">[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 316.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish decision had major consequences not only for the political relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom, but\nfor the people of Gibraltar, many of whom had relatives or homes in Spain. As one of the Gibraltarians who suffered the closure of the frontier explains:\n\n{{quote|The saddest sight was seeing people behind the wire fences on both sides of the land frontier yelling at the top of their voices across the wide dividing space to enquire about the state of relatives, as telephone communications had been cut by the Spaniards.

It connects [[G\u00f6schenen]] with [[Airolo]] and was the first tunnel through the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif]] in order to bypass the [[St Gotthard Pass]]. It is built as one double-track, standard gauge tunnel.<ref name=saw-34>{{cite book | title = Eisenbahnatlas Schweiz | year = 2012 | publisher = Verlag Schweers + Wall GmbH | isbn=978-3-89494-130-7 | page = 34}}</ref> When opened in 1882, the Gotthard Tunnel was the longest tunnel in the world.\n\nThe tunnel rises from the northern portal at G\u00f6schenen ({{convert|1106|m|abbr=on}}) and the highest point ({{convert|1151|m|abbr=on}}) is reached after approximately {{convert|8|km}}.

The bidding war between an engineering company from [[Geneva]] and Italy was fought, and finally, the Swiss engineer [[Louis Favre]] won the project with an estimated cost of 2830 Swiss francs per meter.

It belongs to the [[right-wing]] political coalition [[Chile Vamos]], in conjunction with the [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI), the [[Independent Regionalist Party]] (PRI) and [[Political Evolution]] (Ev\u00f3poli). The party president is [[Mario Desbordes]], and its principal leaders are [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]], two times President of Chile and [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]], former minister of defense, former presidential candidate and Senator.\n\n==History==\nNational Renewal was formed on 29 April 1987 when three rightist organizations \u2013 the [[National Union Movement]] (''Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional'', MUN), the [[National Labour Front (Chile)|National Labour Front]] (''Frente Nacional del Trabajo'', FNT), and the Independent Democratic Union (''Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente'', UDI) \u2014 joined together in preparation for the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|1988 Plebiscite]] that would determine the continuity or not of rule of [[Augusto Pinochet]] who had been in power since the coup of 1973. The UDI soon broke away to run as a separate party due to its strong support for the plebiscite and a Pinochet candidacy, while the remaining National Renewal party indicated its preference for an open election or a candidate other than Pinochet. However, once Pinochet was proclaimed candidate, the overwhelming majority of National Renewal supported him.\n\nThe party was founded on 29 April with 351 founding members. In this way, National Renewal was the first political party to form in Chile after the lifting on the ban of political parties that had been established after the coup; by December of that year, 61,167 members, led by Andr\u00e9s Allamand, had joined. The principal idea that the party proclaimed was to generate an environment of calm during the return of democracy. The party supported UDI candidate [[Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn]] as the sole Alliance candidate in the [[1999\u20132000 Chilean presidential election|1999/2000]] presidential elections, who went on to obtain 47.5% of the votes in the first round, but was subsequently defeated in the second round by [[Ricardo Lagos]].\n\nDuring early 2005, the party initially supported Lav\u00edn to again run as the sole candidate of the Alliance in the [[2005\u201306 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] of that year. However, in face of Lav\u00edn's declining opinion poll numbers, [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]] announced his candidacy as the National Renewal candidate thus ensuring that the Alliance have two candidates for the election. In the first round on 11 December, Pi\u00f1era obtained 25.4% of the vote, which was enough to send him to the run-off on 15 January 2006 with [[Michelle Bachelet]]. With 46.5% of the vote, Pi\u00f1era was defeated by Bachelet.\n\nIn the [[legislative]] [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|elections]], also on 11 December 2005, the party won, as part of the [[Alliance for Chile]], 20 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and currently holds 7 out of 38 seats in the Senate.\n\nIn the [[2009 Chilean parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]], also on 13 December 2009, the party gains, as part of the [[Coalition for Change]], 18 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies of Chile and currently has 8 out of 38 seats in the Senate of Chile.\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 Chilean presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era was elected [[president of Chile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/especiales/2009/nacional/presidenciales2009/despliegue.asp?idnoticia=394236|title=\nMinuto a Minuto: Pi\u00f1era pide a la Concertaci\u00f3n \"que sea oposici\u00f3n fuerte, pero leal\" (finalizado)|accessdate=5 May 2013|author=emol.com|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]] was presidential precandidate for primary elections, the National Renewal party supported the presidential candidacy of [[Evelyn Matthei]] for the [[2013 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]], that lost in second round with the 37% of the votes.\n\nIn January 2014, three deputies (Karla Rubilar, Pedro Browne and Joaqu\u00edn Godoy)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-559643-9-karla-rubilar-joaquin-godoy-y-pedro-browne-confirman-renuncia-a-renovacion.shtml|title=Karla Rubilar, Joaqu\u00edn Godoy y Pedro Browne confirman renuncia a Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional|work=[[La Tercera]]|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=8 January 2014|author=Francisco Torrealba and Alberto Labra}}</ref> and one senator (Lily P\u00e9rez)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|title=Lily P\u00e9rez y renuncia a RN: \"Dej\u00f3 de ser el partido al que entr\u00e9\"|work=La Tercera|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116203913/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> resigned to membership in the party and launched a political movement called \"[[Amplitude (political party)|Amplitude]]\" (''Amplitud''), that aimed to be a new political party inside the Alliance.

'''RN''') is a [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]]<ref name=\"Kirby\"/> political party in [[Chile]]. It belongs to the [[right-wing]] political coalition [[Chile Vamos]], in conjunction with the [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI), the [[Independent Regionalist Party]] (PRI) and [[Political Evolution]] (Ev\u00f3poli). The party president is [[Mario Desbordes]], and its principal leaders are [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]], two times President of Chile and [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]], former minister of defense, former presidential candidate and Senator.\n\n==History==\nNational Renewal was formed on 29 April 1987 when three rightist organizations \u2013 the [[National Union Movement]] (''Movimiento de Uni\u00f3n Nacional'', MUN), the [[National Labour Front (Chile)|National Labour Front]] (''Frente Nacional del Trabajo'', FNT), and the Independent Democratic Union (''Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente'', UDI) \u2014 joined together in preparation for the [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|1988 Plebiscite]] that would determine the continuity or not of rule of [[Augusto Pinochet]] who had been in power since the coup of 1973. The UDI soon broke away to run as a separate party due to its strong support for the plebiscite and a Pinochet candidacy, while the remaining National Renewal party indicated its preference for an open election or a candidate other than Pinochet. However, once Pinochet was proclaimed candidate, the overwhelming majority of National Renewal supported him.\n\nThe party was founded on 29 April with 351 founding members. In this way, National Renewal was the first political party to form in Chile after the lifting on the ban of political parties that had been established after the coup; by December of that year, 61,167 members, led by Andr\u00e9s Allamand, had joined. The principal idea that the party proclaimed was to generate an environment of calm during the return of democracy. The party supported UDI candidate [[Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn]] as the sole Alliance candidate in the [[1999\u20132000 Chilean presidential election|1999/2000]] presidential elections, who went on to obtain 47.5% of the votes in the first round, but was subsequently defeated in the second round by [[Ricardo Lagos]].\n\nDuring early 2005, the party initially supported Lav\u00edn to again run as the sole candidate of the Alliance in the [[2005\u201306 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]] of that year. However, in face of Lav\u00edn's declining opinion poll numbers, [[Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era]] announced his candidacy as the National Renewal candidate thus ensuring that the Alliance have two candidates for the election. In the first round on 11 December, Pi\u00f1era obtained 25.4% of the vote, which was enough to send him to the run-off on 15 January 2006 with [[Michelle Bachelet]]. With 46.5% of the vote, Pi\u00f1era was defeated by Bachelet.\n\nIn the [[legislative]] [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|elections]], also on 11 December 2005, the party won, as part of the [[Alliance for Chile]], 20 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and currently holds 7 out of 38 seats in the Senate.\n\nIn the [[2009 Chilean parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]], also on 13 December 2009, the party gains, as part of the [[Coalition for Change]], 18 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies of Chile and currently has 8 out of 38 seats in the Senate of Chile.\n\nIn the [[2009\u201310 Chilean presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era was elected [[president of Chile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/especiales/2009/nacional/presidenciales2009/despliegue.asp?idnoticia=394236|title=\nMinuto a Minuto: Pi\u00f1era pide a la Concertaci\u00f3n \"que sea oposici\u00f3n fuerte, pero leal\" (finalizado)|accessdate=5 May 2013|author=emol.com|date=17 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Andr\u00e9s Allamand]] was presidential precandidate for primary elections, the National Renewal party supported the presidential candidacy of [[Evelyn Matthei]] for the [[2013 Chilean presidential election|presidential election]], that lost in second round with the 37% of the votes.\n\nIn January 2014, three deputies (Karla Rubilar, Pedro Browne and Joaqu\u00edn Godoy)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-559643-9-karla-rubilar-joaquin-godoy-y-pedro-browne-confirman-renuncia-a-renovacion.shtml|title=Karla Rubilar, Joaqu\u00edn Godoy y Pedro Browne confirman renuncia a Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional|work=[[La Tercera]]|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=8 January 2014|author=Francisco Torrealba and Alberto Labra}}</ref> and one senator (Lily P\u00e9rez)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|title=Lily P\u00e9rez y renuncia a RN: \"Dej\u00f3 de ser el partido al que entr\u00e9\"|work=La Tercera|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=17 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116203913/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/01/674-561116-9-lily-perez-y-su-renuncia-a-rn-dejo-de-ser-el-partido-al-que-entre.shtml|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> resigned to membership in the party and launched a political movement called \"[[Amplitude (political party)|Amplitude]]\" (''Amplitud''), that aimed to be a new political party inside the Alliance.
