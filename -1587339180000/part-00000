These changes provoked accusations by the Serbian media that the changes were \"destabilizing\".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} Serbia's response was a plan to hold demonstrations in Ljubljana with 30,000 to 40,000 Serbs to supposedly inform Slovenes about the situation in Kosovo, while this was suspected to be an action aimed at destabilizing the Slovene government.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} Croatia and Slovenia prevented the Serb protesters from crossing by train into Slovenia.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} Serbia responded by breaking political links between the two republics and 329 Serbian businesses broke ties with Slovenia.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} With these events in 1989, nationalism soared in response along with acts of intolerance, discrimination, and ethnic violence increasing.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} In that year, officials from Bosnia and Herzegovina noted rising tensions between Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs; active rumors spread of incidents between Croats and Serbs and arguments by Croats and Serbs that Bosniaks were not a real nation escalated.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=367}}\n\nWith the collapse of the Yugoslav Communist Party, multiparty elections were held in Serbia in 1990, with a number of nationalist parties running on the agenda of creating a [[Greater Serbia]] as Yugoslavia fell apart.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=358\u2013359}} From 1990 onward, as Serbs in Croatia pushed for autonomy and began to arm themselves, the Serbian state-run newspaper ''Politika'' denounced the Croatian government of Franjo Tu\u0111man for allegedly \"trying to restore the World War II-era Usta\u0161e regime\" and for \"copying Tito\", and pledged that Belgrade would support the Serbs of Croatia.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=359}} The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) began providing weapons to the Serbs in Croatia while the situation in Belgrade grew more intense as Serbs demonstrated outside of the parliament, shouting \"We want arms\" and \"Let's go to Croatia!\".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=361}}\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 and other members of the Serbian leadership in the 1980s attempted to gain support among Serb nationalists by appealing to [[historical revisionism|revisionism]] of the history of Yugoslavia in World War II. To do this, the Tito-era tradition of focusing on rallying the population of Yugoslavia in remembering the total casualties of Yugoslavs in World War II at the hands of Axis forces was replaced with the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government's focus on remembering the Serb casualties of World War II as victims of the Croatian [[Usta\u0161e]].{{sfn|Wydra|2007|p=232}} This attempt to gain nationalist support also had the effect of increasing the radicalization of Serbian nationalism.{{sfn|Wydra|2007|p=232}} In the late 1980s, conspiracy theories that vilified the Roman Catholic Church began to become widespread and were supported by Serbian publishers. This was of particular significance since these were attacks on the national religion of the Croats.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=349}} The political climate in Serbia and Serb territories fostered the rise of ultranationalism and created tense and, at times, violent confrontations between Serbs themselves, particularly between nationalist Serbs and non-nationalist Serbs. Serbs who publicly opposed the nationalist agenda were reported to have been harassed, threatened, or killed.{{sfn|Gagnon|2004|p=5}}\n\nThe Serbian media during Milo\u0161evi\u0107's era was known to espouse Serb nationalism and patriotism,{{sfn|Gordy|1999|p=61\u2013101}} while promoting [[xenophobia]] toward the other ethnicities in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Gordy|1999|p=72\u201375}} Ethnic Albanians were commonly characterised in the media as anti-Yugoslav counter-revolutionaries, rapists, and a threat to the Serb nation.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=55}} The Serbian state-run newspaper ''[[Politika]]'' had a number of xenophobic headlines such as in 1991, saying \"The [[Shqiptar#Use in South Slavic languages|\u0160iptars]] <nowiki>[Albanians]</nowiki> are watching and waiting\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=74}} The newspaper also attacked Croats for the election of Franjo Tu\u0111man as president, saying that the \"Croatian leadership again shames the Croatian people\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=72}} It attempted to assert that Croats and ethnic Albanians were cooperating in a campaign against the Serbian government during the 1991 protests in Belgrade against Milo\u0161evi\u0107's government, denying that Serbs took part in the protest while claiming \"it was the \u0160iptars and Croats who demonstrated\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=72}} When war erupted in Croatia, ''Politika'' promoted Serb nationalism, hostility towards Croatia, and violence, and on 2 April 1991, the newspaper's headline read \"Krajina decides to join Serbia\". One of the newspaper's stories was \"Serbian unity\u2014saving Krajina\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=76}} On 5 June 1991, ''Politika ekpres'' ran a piece titled \"Serbs must get weapons\". On 25 June 1991 and 3 July 1991, Politika began to openly promote partitioning Croatia, saying \"We can't accept Croatia keeping these borders\", \"Krajina in the same state with Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina\", and prominently quoted Jovan Marjanovi\u0107 of the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]], who said \"The <nowiki>[Yugoslav]</nowiki> Army must come into Croatia and occupy the line [[Benkovac]]-[[Karlovac]]-[[Pakrac]]-[[Baranya (region)|Baranja]]\", which would essentially have occupied almost all of Croatia and all the territories in Croatia that were claimed by nationalist promoters of a [[Greater Serbia]].{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=79}} To promote fear and anger among Serbs towards Croatia, on 25 June 1991, ''Politika'' reminded Serbs about the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|atrocities]] by the Croatian fascist [[Usta\u0161e]] against Serbs during World War II by saying \"[[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] <nowiki>[an Ustase concentration camp in World War II]</nowiki> mustn't be forgotten\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=78}} According to [[Borisav Jovi\u0107]], who was formerly a close Milo\u0161evi\u0107 ally, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 exercised media censorship and maintained strong personal influence over Serbia's state media outlets, having \"personally appointed editors-in-chief of newspapers and news programs&nbsp;...\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt1.pdf|title=Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 Trial Public Archive|work=Human Rights Project}}</ref> Serbian state media during the wars featured controversial reportage that villainized the other ethnic factions.

In the five-man presidential race held on 24 September 2000, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was defeated in the first round by opposition leader [[Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica]], who won slightly more than 50% of the vote. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 initially refused to acquiesce, claiming that no one had won a majority. The Yugoslav constitution called for a runoff between the top two candidates in the event that no candidate won more than 50% of the vote. Official results put Ko\u0161tunica ahead of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 but at under 50 percent. The internationally financed CeSID claimed otherwise, though its story changed throughout the two weeks between 24 September and 5 October. This led to mass demonstrations in Belgrade on 5 October, known as the [[Bulldozer Revolution]].

He led the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] from its foundation in 1990 and rose to power as Serbian President during efforts to reform the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia]] in response to alleged marginalization of Serbia, views that the powers of Serbia's autonomous provinces were too strong making them almost independent from Serbia, and claims of political incapacity to deter [[Albanians|Albanian]] separatist unrest in Serbia's autonomous province of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]].\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107's presidency of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was marked by several major reforms to Serbia's constitution from the 1980s to the 1990s that reduced the powers of the autonomous provinces in Serbia.

These changes provoked accusations by the Serbian media that the changes were \"destabilizing\".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} Serbia's response was a plan to hold demonstrations in Ljubljana with 30,000 to 40,000 Serbs to supposedly inform Slovenes about the situation in Kosovo, while this was suspected to be an action aimed at destabilizing the Slovene government.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} Croatia and Slovenia prevented the Serb protesters from crossing by train into Slovenia.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} Serbia responded by breaking political links between the two republics and 329 Serbian businesses broke ties with Slovenia.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} With these events in 1989, nationalism soared in response along with acts of intolerance, discrimination, and ethnic violence increasing.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=366}} In that year, officials from Bosnia and Herzegovina noted rising tensions between Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs; active rumors spread of incidents between Croats and Serbs and arguments by Croats and Serbs that Bosniaks were not a real nation escalated.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=367}}\n\nWith the collapse of the Yugoslav Communist Party, multiparty elections were held in Serbia in 1990, with a number of nationalist parties running on the agenda of creating a [[Greater Serbia]] as Yugoslavia fell apart.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=358\u2013359}} From 1990 onward, as Serbs in Croatia pushed for autonomy and began to arm themselves, the Serbian state-run newspaper ''Politika'' denounced the Croatian government of Franjo Tu\u0111man for allegedly \"trying to restore the World War II-era Usta\u0161e regime\" and for \"copying Tito\", and pledged that Belgrade would support the Serbs of Croatia.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=359}} The [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) began providing weapons to the Serbs in Croatia while the situation in Belgrade grew more intense as Serbs demonstrated outside of the parliament, shouting \"We want arms\" and \"Let's go to Croatia!\".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=361}}\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 and other members of the Serbian leadership in the 1980s attempted to gain support among Serb nationalists by appealing to [[historical revisionism|revisionism]] of the history of Yugoslavia in World War II. To do this, the Tito-era tradition of focusing on rallying the population of Yugoslavia in remembering the total casualties of Yugoslavs in World War II at the hands of Axis forces was replaced with the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government's focus on remembering the Serb casualties of World War II as victims of the Croatian [[Usta\u0161e]].{{sfn|Wydra|2007|p=232}} This attempt to gain nationalist support also had the effect of increasing the radicalization of Serbian nationalism.{{sfn|Wydra|2007|p=232}} In the late 1980s, conspiracy theories that vilified the Roman Catholic Church began to become widespread and were supported by Serbian publishers. This was of particular significance since these were attacks on the national religion of the Croats.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=349}} The political climate in Serbia and Serb territories fostered the rise of ultranationalism and created tense and, at times, violent confrontations between Serbs themselves, particularly between nationalist Serbs and non-nationalist Serbs. Serbs who publicly opposed the nationalist agenda were reported to have been harassed, threatened, or killed.{{sfn|Gagnon|2004|p=5}}\n\nThe Serbian media during Milo\u0161evi\u0107's era was known to espouse Serb nationalism and patriotism,{{sfn|Gordy|1999|p=61\u2013101}} while promoting [[xenophobia]] toward the other ethnicities in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Gordy|1999|p=72\u201375}} Ethnic Albanians were commonly characterised in the media as anti-Yugoslav counter-revolutionaries, rapists, and a threat to the Serb nation.{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=55}} The Serbian state-run newspaper ''[[Politika]]'' had a number of xenophobic headlines such as in 1991, saying \"The [[Shqiptar#Use in South Slavic languages|\u0160iptars]] <nowiki>[Albanians]</nowiki> are watching and waiting\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=74}} The newspaper also attacked Croats for the election of Franjo Tu\u0111man as president, saying that the \"Croatian leadership again shames the Croatian people\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=72}} It attempted to assert that Croats and ethnic Albanians were cooperating in a campaign against the Serbian government during the 1991 protests in Belgrade against Milo\u0161evi\u0107's government, denying that Serbs took part in the protest while claiming \"it was the \u0160iptars and Croats who demonstrated\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=72}} When war erupted in Croatia, ''Politika'' promoted Serb nationalism, hostility towards Croatia, and violence, and on 2 April 1991, the newspaper's headline read \"Krajina decides to join Serbia\". One of the newspaper's stories was \"Serbian unity\u2014saving Krajina\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=76}} On 5 June 1991, ''Politika ekpres'' ran a piece titled \"Serbs must get weapons\". On 25 June 1991 and 3 July 1991, Politika began to openly promote partitioning Croatia, saying \"We can't accept Croatia keeping these borders\", \"Krajina in the same state with Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina\", and prominently quoted Jovan Marjanovi\u0107 of the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]], who said \"The <nowiki>[Yugoslav]</nowiki> Army must come into Croatia and occupy the line [[Benkovac]]-[[Karlovac]]-[[Pakrac]]-[[Baranya (region)|Baranja]]\", which would essentially have occupied almost all of Croatia and all the territories in Croatia that were claimed by nationalist promoters of a [[Greater Serbia]].{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=79}} To promote fear and anger among Serbs towards Croatia, on 25 June 1991, ''Politika'' reminded Serbs about the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|atrocities]] by the Croatian fascist [[Usta\u0161e]] against Serbs during World War II by saying \"[[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] <nowiki>[an Ustase concentration camp in World War II]</nowiki> mustn't be forgotten\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994|p=78}} According to [[Borisav Jovi\u0107]], who was formerly a close Milo\u0161evi\u0107 ally, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 exercised media censorship and maintained strong personal influence over Serbia's state media outlets, having \"personally appointed editors-in-chief of newspapers and news programs&nbsp;...\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt1.pdf|title=Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 Trial Public Archive|work=Human Rights Project}}</ref> Serbian state media during the wars featured controversial reportage that villainized the other ethnic factions.

In the five-man presidential race held on 24 September 2000, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was defeated in the first round by opposition leader [[Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica]], who won slightly more than 50% of the vote. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 initially refused to acquiesce, claiming that no one had won a majority. The Yugoslav constitution called for a runoff between the top two candidates in the event that no candidate won more than 50% of the vote. Official results put Ko\u0161tunica ahead of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 but at under 50 percent. The internationally financed CeSID claimed otherwise, though its story changed throughout the two weeks between 24 September and 5 October. This led to mass demonstrations in Belgrade on 5 October, known as the [[Bulldozer Revolution]].

The region was poor and many people struggled to survive; young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere. He was born in the current province of Badajoz.<ref name=Leon />{{rp|135}} Three towns\u2014[[Badajoz]], [[Barcarrota]] and [[Jerez de los Caballeros]]\u2014claim to be his birthplace. He spent time as a child at each place. He stipulated in his will that his body be interred at Jerez de los Caballeros, where other members of his family were buried.<ref>Charles Hudson (1997). Page 39.</ref> A few years before his birth, the Spanish [[Reconquista|took back]] control of the [[Iberian peninsula]] from Islamic forces. Spain and [[Portugal]] were filled with young men seeking a chance for military fame after the defeat of the [[Moors]]. With discovery of new lands (which they thought at the time to be [[East Asia]]) across the ocean to the west, young men were attracted to rumors of adventure, glory and wealth.\n\n==In the New World==\nNEW WORLD\n\n== Conquest of Peru ==\nWhen Pizarro and his men first encountered the army of Inca [[Atahualpa]] at [[Cajamarca]], Pizarro sent de Soto with fifteen men to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. When Pizarro's men attacked Atahualpa and his guard the next day (the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]), de Soto led one of the three groups of mounted soldiers. The Spanish captured Atahualpa. De Soto was sent to the camp of the [[Inca]] army, where he and his men plundered Atahualpa's tents.<ref>MacQuarrie. Pp. 57-68, 71-2, 91-2.</ref>\n\nDuring 1533, the Spanish held Atahualpa captive in Cajamarca for months while his subjects paid for his ransom by filling a room with gold and silver objects. During this captivity, de Soto became friendly with Atahualpa and taught him to play [[chess]]. By the time the ransom had been completed, the Spanish became alarmed by rumors of an Inca army advancing on Cajamarca. Pizarro sent de Soto with 200 soldiers to scout for the rumored army.<ref name=Hagen>Von Hagen, Victor W., 1955, \"De Soto and the Golden Road\", ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', August 1955, ''Vol. VI, No.5'', [[American Heritage Publishing]], NY, NY., pp.32-37</ref>\n\nWhile de Soto was gone, the Spanish in Cajamarca decided to kill Atahualpa to prevent his rescue. De Soto returned to report that he found no signs of an army in the area. After executing Atahualpa, Pizarro and his men headed to [[Cuzco]], the capital of the Incan Empire. As the Spanish force approached Cuzco, Pizarro sent his brother [[Hernando Pizarro|Hernando]] and de Soto ahead with 40 men. The advance guard fought a pitched battle with Inca troops in front of the city, but the battle had ended before Pizarro arrived with the rest of the Spanish party. The Inca army withdrew during the night. The Spanish plundered Cuzco, where they found much gold and silver. As a mounted soldier, de Soto received a share of the plunder, which made him very wealthy. It represented riches from Atahualpa's camp, his ransom, and the plunder from Cuzco.<ref>MacQuarrie. Pp. 96, 106, 135, 138, 145, 169.</ref>\n\nOn the road to Cuzco, [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], a brother of Atahualpa, had joined Pizarro. Manco had been hiding from Atahualpa in fear of his life, and was happy to gain Pizarro's protection. Pizarro arranged for Manco to be installed as the Inca leader. De Soto joined Manco in a campaign to eliminate the Inca armies under [[Quizquiz]], who had been loyal to Atahualpa.<ref name=Yupanqui>Yupanqui, T.C., 2005, ''An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru,'' [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]: [[University Press of Colorado]], {{ISBN|9780870818219}}</ref>{{rp|66\u201367,70\u201373}}\n\nBy 1534, de Soto was serving as lieutenant governor of Cuzco while Pizarro was building his new capital on the coast; it later became known as [[Lima]]. In 1535 King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] awarded [[Diego de Almagro]], Francisco Pizarro's partner, the governorship of the southern portion of the Inca Empire. When de Almagro made plans to explore and conquer the southern part of the Inca empire (now [[Chile]]), de Soto applied to be his second-in-command, but de Almagro turned him down.

De Soto was expected to colonize the North American continent for Spain within four years, for which his family would be given a sizable piece of land.\n\nFascinated by the stories of [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca|Cabeza de Vaca]], who had survived years in North America after becoming a castaway and had just returned to Spain, de Soto selected 620 [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] volunteers, including some of mixed-race [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent known as Atlantic Creoles, to accompany him to govern Cuba and colonize North America. Averaging 24 years of age, the men embarked from [[Havana]] on seven of the King's [[Galleon|ships]] and two [[caravel]]s of de Soto's. With tons of heavy [[armor]] and equipment, they also carried more than 500 head of livestock, including 237 horses and 200 pigs, for their planned four-year continental expedition.\n\nDe Soto wrote a new will before embarking on his travels. On 10 May 1539, he wrote in his will:\n\n<blockquote>That a chapel be erected within the Church of San Miguel in Jerez de Los Caballeros, Spain, where De Soto grew up, at a cost of 2,000 ducats, with an altarpiece featuring the Virgin Mary, [[Our Lady of the Conception]], that his tomb be covered in a fine black broadcloth topped by a red cross of the [[Order of Santiago|Order of the Knights of Santiago]], and on special occasions a pall of black velvet with the De Soto coat of arms be placed on the altar; that a chaplain be hired at the salary of 12,000 maravedis to perform five masses every week for the souls of De Soto, his parents, and wife; that thirty masses be said for him the day his body was interred, and twenty for our Lady of the Conception, ten for the [[Holy Ghost]], sixty for souls in [[purgatory]] and masses for many others as well; that 150000 [[maravedi]]s be given annually to his wife Isabel for her needs and an equal amount used yearly to marry off three orphan damsels...the poorest that can be found,\" to assist his wife and also serve to burnish the memory of De Soto as a man of charity and substance.<ref>Davidson, James West.

The most widely used version of \"De Soto's Trail\" comes from a study commissioned by the [[United States Congress]]. A committee chaired by the [[anthropologist]] [[John R. Swanton]] published ''The Final Report of the United States De Soto Expedition Commission'' in 1939. Among other locations, [[Manatee County, Florida]], claims an approximate landing site for de Soto and has a national memorial recognizing that event.<ref>[http://www.manateechamber.com/history.asp Manatee County History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421013518/http://www.manateechamber.com/history.asp |date=2008-04-21 }}, Manatee Florida Chamber of Commerce.</ref> In the early 21st century, the first part of the expedition's course, up to de Soto's battle at [[Mabila]] (a small fortress town in present-day central [[Alabama]]<ref>Sylvia Flowers, \"DeSoto's Expedition\", U.S. [[National Park Service]], 2007, webpage: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090513014635/http://www.nps.gov/archive/ocmu/DeSoto.htm  NPS-DeSoto].</ref>), is disputed only in minor details. His route beyond Mabila is contested.

He recruited guides from each tribe along the route. A chain of communication was established whereby a guide who had lived in close proximity to another tribal area was able to pass his information and language on to a guide from a neighboring area. Because Ortiz refused to dress as an [[Hidalgo (nobility)|''hidalgo'']] Spaniard, other officers questioned his motives. De Soto remained loyal to Ortiz, allowing him the freedom to dress and live among his native friends. Another important guide was the seventeen-year-old boy ''Perico'', or Pedro, from what is now [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He spoke several of the local tribes' languages and could communicate with Ortiz. Perico was taken as a guide in 1540. The Spanish had also captured other Indians, whom they used as [[slave]] labor.{{clarify|reason=this is the first time \"slavery\" has been mentioned. Not a trivial topic.|date=December 2013}} Perico was treated better due to his value to the Spaniards.\n\nThe expedition traveled north, exploring Florida's West Coast, and encountering native ambushes and conflicts along the way. De Soto's first winter encampment was at ''[[Anhaica]]'', the capital of the [[Apalachee]] people. It is one of the few places on the route where archaeologists have found physical traces of the expedition. The chroniclers described this settlement as being near the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition#Apalachee|\"Bay of Horses\"]].

They had lost nearly half their men, and most of the horses. By this time, the soldiers were wearing animal skins for clothing. Many were injured and in poor health. The leaders came to a consensus (although not total) to end the expedition and try to find a way home, either down the Mississippi River, or overland across [[Texas]] to the Spanish colony of [[Mexico City]].\n\nThey decided that building boats would be too difficult and time-consuming, and that navigating the Gulf of Mexico was too risky, so they headed overland to the southwest. Eventually they reached a region in present-day Texas that was dry. The native populations were made up mostly of subsistence hunter-gatherers. The soldiers found no villages to raid for food, and the army was still too large to live off the land. They were forced to backtrack to the more developed agricultural regions along the Mississippi, where they began building seven ''bergantines'', or [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]].<ref name=\"TexBook\" /> They melted down all the iron, including horse tackle and slave shackles, to make nails for the boats. They survived through the winter, and the spring floods delayed them another two months. By July they set off on their makeshift boats down the Mississippi for the coast.\n\nTaking about two weeks to make the journey, the expedition encountered hostile fleets of war canoes along the whole course. The first was led by the powerful paramount chief ''[[Quigualtam]]'', whose fleet followed the boats, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days on end as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish had no effective offensive weapons on the water, as their [[crossbow]]s had long ceased working. They relied on armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded.\n\nOn reaching the mouth of the Mississippi, they stayed close to the Gulf shore heading south and west. After about 50 days, they made it to the [[P\u00e1nuco River]] and the Spanish frontier town of [[P\u00e1nuco, Veracruz|P\u00e1nuco]]. There they rested for about a month. During this time many of the Spaniards, having safely returned and reflecting on their accomplishments, decided they had left ''La Florida'' too soon. There were some fights within the company, leading to some deaths. But, after they reached Mexico City and Viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza|Don Antonio de Mendoza]] offered to lead another expedition to ''La Florida'', few of the survivors volunteered. Of the recorded 700 participants at the start, between 300 and 350 survived (311 is a commonly accepted figure). Most of the men stayed in the New World, settling in Mexico, Peru, Cuba, and other Spanish colonies.\n\n== Effects of expedition in North America ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 350\n | footer = Reverse of a $500 Federal Reserve Note (and the earlier [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] proof [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|engraving]]) based on [[w:William Henry Powell|William H.

They acquired neither gold nor prosperity and founded no colonies. But the expedition had several major consequences.\n\nIt contributed to the process of the [[Columbian Exchange]].

Because the indigenous people lacked the immunity which the Europeans had acquired through generations of exposure to these [[Eurasia]]n diseases, [[Native American disease and epidemics|the Native Americans suffered epidemics]] of illness after exposure to such diseases as [[measles]], [[smallpox]], and [[chicken pox]]. Several areas traversed by the expedition became depopulated by disease caused by contact with the Europeans. Seeing the high fatalities and devastation caused, many natives fled the populated areas for the surrounding hills and swamps.

The de Soto expedition's descriptions of North American natives are the earliest-known source of information about the societies in the Southeast. They are the only European description of the culture and habits of North American native tribes before these peoples encountered other Europeans. De Soto's men were both the first and nearly the last Europeans to witness the villages and civilization of the [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nDe Soto's expedition led the Spanish crown to reconsider Spain's attitude toward the colonies north of [[Mexico]]. He claimed large parts of North America for Spain. The Spanish concentrated their missions in the state of [[Florida]] and along the Pacific coast.\n\n== Namesakes ==\n[[File:DeSoto automobile insignia Harrisonburg VA July 2008.jpg|thumb|[[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] Deluxe automobile insignia from early 1950s]]\n\nMany parks, towns, counties, and institutions have been named after Hernando de Soto, to include:\n\n===Places===\n*[[De Soto, Georgia]]\n*[[De Soto, Illinois]]\n*[[De Soto, Iowa]]\n*[[De Soto, Kansas]]\n*[[De Soto, Mississippi]]\n*[[De Soto, Missouri]]\n*[[De Soto, Nebraska]]\n*[[De Soto, Wisconsin]]\n*[[DeSoto, Texas]]\n*[[DeSoto Caverns]], [[Alabama]]\n*[[DeSoto County, Florida]]\n*[[DeSoto County, Mississippi]], and its county seat, [[Hernando, Mississippi|Hernando]]\n*[[DeSoto Falls (Alabama)|DeSoto Falls]], in DeSoto State Park, Alabama\n*[[DeSoto Falls (Georgia)|DeSoto Falls]], in [[Lumpkin County, Georgia]]\n*[[DeSoto Lake]], Georgia\n*[[De Soto National Forest]], in [[Mississippi]]\n*[[De Soto National Memorial]], near [[Bradenton, Florida]], marks the possible location of ''Espiritu Santo'', the point of disembarkation for the expedition.\n*[[DeSoto Parish, Louisiana]]\n*[[DeSoto Site Historic State Park]], Florida\n*[[DeSoto State Park]], [[Alabama]]\n*[[Fort De Soto Park]] in [[Pinellas County, Florida]], named in turn for the 19th-century coastal fortifications at the site\n*[[Hernando, Florida]]\n*[[Hernando County, Florida]]\n\n===Other===\n*[[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto automobile line]] developed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]]\n*[[De Soto Heritage Festival]]\n*[[DeSoto Central High School]], in [[Southaven, Mississippi]]\n*[[DeSoto County High School]], in [[Arcadia, Florida]]\n*DeSoto Hilton Hotel, [[Savannah, Georgia]]\n*[[De Soto High School (Kansas)|De Soto High School]], in De Soto, Kansas\n*De Soto High School, in De Soto, Missouri\n*[[DeSoto High School (Texas)|DeSoto High School]], in DeSoto, Texas\n*De Soto High School, in De Soto, Wisconsin\n*[[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which carries [[Interstate 40]] across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] (opened in 1973)\n*PS 130, Hernando Desoto, a public school in [[New York City]]\n*The De Soto School, a private school in [[Helena, Arkansas]]\n*{{USS|De Soto|1859}}, a Navy steamer that served during the [[American Civil War]] and in the West Indies.\n*{{USS|De Soto|1860}}, a riverboat that was renamed ''General Lyon'' on 24 October 1862.\n*{{USS|DeSoto County|LST-1171}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|United States|Florida|Spain}}\n* [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=yes|viaf=23382263}}\n{{Refbegin}}<!--use smaller font-->\n\n=== Chronicles (in English translations) ===\n*{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Lawrence A.|last2=Knight|first2=Vernon James, Jr.|last3=Moore|first3=Edward C.|title=The De Soto Chronicles, The Expedition of Hernando de Soto to North America in 1539\u20131543|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780817305932|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|isbn=978-0-8173-0824-7}}\n*{{cite book|title=Narratives of the career of Hernando de Soto in the conquest of Florida as told by a knight of Elvas, and in a relation by Luys Hernandez de Biedma, factor of the expedition Volume I|year=1904|publisher=A.

The region was poor and many people struggled to survive; young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere. He was born in the current province of Badajoz.<ref name=Leon />{{rp|135}} Three towns\u2014[[Badajoz]], [[Barcarrota]] and [[Jerez de los Caballeros]]\u2014claim to be his birthplace. He spent time as a child at each place. He stipulated in his will that his body be interred at Jerez de los Caballeros, where other members of his family were buried.<ref>Charles Hudson (1997). Page 39.</ref> A few years before his birth, the Spanish [[Reconquista|took back]] control of the [[Iberian peninsula]] from Islamic forces. Spain and [[Portugal]] were filled with young men seeking a chance for military fame after the defeat of the [[Moors]]. With discovery of new lands (which they thought at the time to be [[East Asia]]) across the ocean to the west, young men were attracted to rumors of adventure, glory and wealth.\n\n==In the New World==\nDe Soto sailed to the [[New World]] with [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]], appointed as the first Governor of [[Panama]]. In 1520 he participated in [[Gaspar de Espinosa]]'s expedition to [[Veragua]], and in 1524, he participated in the conquest of [[Nicaragua]] under [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]]. There he acquired an ''[[encomienda]]'' and a public office in [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua]].<ref name=Leon />{{rp|135}}\n\nBrave leadership, unwavering loyalty, and ruthless schemes for the extortion of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native villages]] for their captured chiefs became de Soto's hallmarks during the [[History of Panama|conquest of Central America]]. He gained fame as an excellent horseman, fighter, and tactician. During that time, de Soto was influenced by the achievements of Spanish explorers: [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the first European to reach [[Florida]]; [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]], the first European to reach the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast of the Americas (he called it the \"South Sea\" on the south coast of [[Panama]]); and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who first sailed that ocean to [[East Asia]].\n\nIn 1530, de Soto became a ''[[regidor]]'' of [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua]]. He led an expedition up the coast of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] searching for a passage between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to enable trade with the Orient, the richest market in the world. Failing that, and without means to explore further, de Soto, upon [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila]]'s death, left his estates in Nicaragua. Bringing his own men on ships which he hired, de Soto joined [[Francisco Pizarro]] at his first base of [[Tumbes, Peru|Tumbes]] shortly before departure for the interior of present-day [[Peru]].<ref name=Prescott>Prescott, W.H., (2011) ''The History of the Conquest of Peru,'' Digireads.com Publishing, {{ISBN|9781420941142}}</ref>{{rp|143}}\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}<!--NAVBOX: floats--> Pizarro quickly made de Soto one of his captains.<ref name=Leon />{{rp|171}}\n\n== Conquest of Peru ==\nWhen Pizarro and his men first encountered the army of Inca [[Atahualpa]] at [[Cajamarca]], Pizarro sent de Soto with fifteen men to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. When Pizarro's men attacked Atahualpa and his guard the next day (the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]), de Soto led one of the three groups of mounted soldiers. The Spanish captured Atahualpa. De Soto was sent to the camp of the [[Inca]] army, where he and his men plundered Atahualpa's tents.<ref>MacQuarrie. Pp. 57-68, 71-2, 91-2.</ref>\n\nDuring 1533, the Spanish held Atahualpa captive in Cajamarca for months while his subjects paid for his ransom by filling a room with gold and silver objects. During this captivity, de Soto became friendly with Atahualpa and taught him to play [[chess]]. By the time the ransom had been completed, the Spanish became alarmed by rumors of an Inca army advancing on Cajamarca. Pizarro sent de Soto with 200 soldiers to scout for the rumored army.<ref name=Hagen>Von Hagen, Victor W., 1955, \"De Soto and the Golden Road\", ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', August 1955, ''Vol. VI, No.5'', [[American Heritage Publishing]], NY, NY., pp.32-37</ref>\n\nWhile de Soto was gone, the Spanish in Cajamarca decided to kill Atahualpa to prevent his rescue. De Soto returned to report that he found no signs of an army in the area. After executing Atahualpa, Pizarro and his men headed to [[Cuzco]], the capital of the Incan Empire. As the Spanish force approached Cuzco, Pizarro sent his brother [[Hernando Pizarro|Hernando]] and de Soto ahead with 40 men. The advance guard fought a pitched battle with Inca troops in front of the city, but the battle had ended before Pizarro arrived with the rest of the Spanish party. The Inca army withdrew during the night. The Spanish plundered Cuzco, where they found much gold and silver. As a mounted soldier, de Soto received a share of the plunder, which made him very wealthy. It represented riches from Atahualpa's camp, his ransom, and the plunder from Cuzco.<ref>MacQuarrie. Pp. 96, 106, 135, 138, 145, 169.</ref>\n\nOn the road to Cuzco, [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], a brother of Atahualpa, had joined Pizarro. Manco had been hiding from Atahualpa in fear of his life, and was happy to gain Pizarro's protection. Pizarro arranged for Manco to be installed as the Inca leader. De Soto joined Manco in a campaign to eliminate the Inca armies under [[Quizquiz]], who had been loyal to Atahualpa.<ref name=Yupanqui>Yupanqui, T.C., 2005, ''An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru,'' [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]: [[University Press of Colorado]], {{ISBN|9780870818219}}</ref>{{rp|66\u201367,70\u201373}}\n\nBy 1534, de Soto was serving as lieutenant governor of Cuzco while Pizarro was building his new capital on the coast; it later became known as [[Lima]]. In 1535 King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] awarded [[Diego de Almagro]], Francisco Pizarro's partner, the governorship of the southern portion of the Inca Empire. When de Almagro made plans to explore and conquer the southern part of the Inca empire (now [[Chile]]), de Soto applied to be his second-in-command, but de Almagro turned him down.

De Soto was expected to colonize the North American continent for Spain within four years, for which his family would be given a sizable piece of land.\n\nFascinated by the stories of [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca|Cabeza de Vaca]], who had survived years in North America after becoming a castaway and had just returned to Spain, de Soto selected 620 [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] volunteers, including some of mixed-race [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent known as Atlantic Creoles, to accompany him to govern Cuba and colonize North America. Averaging 24 years of age, the men embarked from [[Havana]] on seven of the King's [[Galleon|ships]] and two [[caravel]]s of de Soto's. With tons of heavy [[armor]] and equipment, they also carried more than 500 head of livestock, including 237 horses and 200 pigs, for their planned four-year continental expedition.\n\nDe Soto wrote a new will before embarking on his travels. On 10 May 1539, he wrote in his will:\n\n<blockquote>That a chapel be erected within the Church of San Miguel in Jerez de Los Caballeros, Spain, where De Soto grew up, at a cost of 2,000 ducats, with an altarpiece featuring the Virgin Mary, [[Our Lady of the Conception]], that his tomb be covered in a fine black broadcloth topped by a red cross of the [[Order of Santiago|Order of the Knights of Santiago]], and on special occasions a pall of black velvet with the De Soto coat of arms be placed on the altar; that a chaplain be hired at the salary of 12,000 maravedis to perform five masses every week for the souls of De Soto, his parents, and wife; that thirty masses be said for him the day his body was interred, and twenty for our Lady of the Conception, ten for the [[Holy Ghost]], sixty for souls in [[purgatory]] and masses for many others as well; that 150000 [[maravedi]]s be given annually to his wife Isabel for her needs and an equal amount used yearly to marry off three orphan damsels...the poorest that can be found,\" to assist his wife and also serve to burnish the memory of De Soto as a man of charity and substance.<ref>Davidson, James West.

It was apparently used by [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]] in writing his ''La historia general y natural de las Indias''. Oviedo died in 1557. The part of his work containing Ranjel's diary was not published until 1851. An English translation of Ranjel's report was first published in 1904.\n* The fourth chronicle is by [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]], known as ''El Inca'' (the Inca). Garcilaso de la Vega did not participate in the expedition. He wrote his account, ''La Florida'', known in English as ''The Florida of the Inca'', decades after the expedition, based on interviews with some survivors of the expedition. The book was first published in 1605. Historians have identified problems with using ''La Florida'' as a historical account. [[Jerald T. Milanich|Milanich]] and [[Charles M.

He recruited guides from each tribe along the route. A chain of communication was established whereby a guide who had lived in close proximity to another tribal area was able to pass his information and language on to a guide from a neighboring area. Because Ortiz refused to dress as an [[Hidalgo (nobility)|''hidalgo'']] Spaniard, other officers questioned his motives. De Soto remained loyal to Ortiz, allowing him the freedom to dress and live among his native friends. Another important guide was the seventeen-year-old boy ''Perico'', or Pedro, from what is now [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He spoke several of the local tribes' languages and could communicate with Ortiz. Perico was taken as a guide in 1540. The Spanish had also captured other Indians, whom they used as [[slave]] labor.{{clarify|reason=this is the first time \"slavery\" has been mentioned. Not a trivial topic.|date=December 2013}} Perico was treated better due to his value to the Spaniards.\n\nThe expedition traveled north, exploring Florida's West Coast, and encountering native ambushes and conflicts along the way. De Soto's first winter encampment was at ''[[Anhaica]]'', the capital of the [[Apalachee]] people. It is one of the few places on the route where archaeologists have found physical traces of the expedition. The chroniclers described this settlement as being near the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition#Apalachee|\"Bay of Horses\"]]. The bay was named for events of the 1527 [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], the members of which, dying of starvation, killed and ate their horses while building boats for escape by the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n=== 1540: The Southeast ===\nFrom their winter location in the western panhandle of Florida, having heard of gold being mined \"toward the sun's rising\", the expedition turned northeast through what is now the modern state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Seibert |first1=David |title=De Soto in Georgia |url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/baldwin/desoto-in-georgia |website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac |publisher=Digital Library of Georgia |accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Seibert |first1=David |title=De Soto in Georgia |url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/bibb/desoto-in-georgia1 |website=GeorgiaInfo: an Online Georgia Almanac |publisher=Digital Library of Georgia |accessdate=7 November 2016}}</ref> Based on archaeological finds made in 2009 at a remote, privately owned site near the [[Ocmulgee River]], researchers believe that de Soto's expedition stopped in [[Telfair County, Georgia|Telfair County]].

McGraw Hill, New York 2010, Chapter 1, p. 3</ref>\n\nDe Soto had encouraged the local natives to believe that he was a deity, specifically an \"immortal [[solar deity|Son of the Sun]],\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title= Hernando de Soto (1500?\u20131542) | encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Arkansas| publisher= The Central Arkansas Library System}}</ref> as a ploy to gain their submission without conflict. Some of the natives had already become skeptical of de Soto's deity claims, so his men were anxious to conceal his death. The actual site of his burial is not known. According to one source, de Soto's men hid his corpse in blankets weighted with sand and sank it in the middle of the Mississippi River during the night.<ref name=\"Hudson_Death-of-de-Soto:349-52\" />\n\n=== Return of the expedition to Mexico City ===\n{{main|Quigualtam}}\nDe Soto's expedition had explored ''La Florida'' for three years without finding the expected treasures or a hospitable site for colonization. They had lost nearly half their men, and most of the horses. By this time, the soldiers were wearing animal skins for clothing. Many were injured and in poor health. The leaders came to a consensus (although not total) to end the expedition and try to find a way home, either down the Mississippi River, or overland across [[Texas]] to the Spanish colony of [[Mexico City]].\n\nThey decided that building boats would be too difficult and time-consuming, and that navigating the Gulf of Mexico was too risky, so they headed overland to the southwest. Eventually they reached a region in present-day Texas that was dry. The native populations were made up mostly of subsistence hunter-gatherers. The soldiers found no villages to raid for food, and the army was still too large to live off the land. They were forced to backtrack to the more developed agricultural regions along the Mississippi, where they began building seven ''bergantines'', or [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]].<ref name=\"TexBook\" /> They melted down all the iron, including horse tackle and slave shackles, to make nails for the boats. They survived through the winter, and the spring floods delayed them another two months. By July they set off on their makeshift boats down the Mississippi for the coast.\n\nTaking about two weeks to make the journey, the expedition encountered hostile fleets of war canoes along the whole course. The first was led by the powerful paramount chief ''[[Quigualtam]]'', whose fleet followed the boats, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days on end as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish had no effective offensive weapons on the water, as their [[crossbow]]s had long ceased working. They relied on armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded.\n\nOn reaching the mouth of the Mississippi, they stayed close to the Gulf shore heading south and west. After about 50 days, they made it to the [[P\u00e1nuco River]] and the Spanish frontier town of [[P\u00e1nuco, Veracruz|P\u00e1nuco]]. There they rested for about a month. During this time many of the Spaniards, having safely returned and reflecting on their accomplishments, decided they had left ''La Florida'' too soon. There were some fights within the company, leading to some deaths. But, after they reached Mexico City and Viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza|Don Antonio de Mendoza]] offered to lead another expedition to ''La Florida'', few of the survivors volunteered. Of the recorded 700 participants at the start, between 300 and 350 survived (311 is a commonly accepted figure). Most of the men stayed in the New World, settling in Mexico, Peru, Cuba, and other Spanish colonies.\n\n== Effects of expedition in North America ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 350\n | footer = Reverse of a $500 Federal Reserve Note (and the earlier [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] proof [[Art and engraving on United States banknotes|engraving]]) based on [[w:William Henry Powell|William H.

They acquired neither gold nor prosperity and founded no colonies. But the expedition had several major consequences.\n\nIt contributed to the process of the [[Columbian Exchange]]. For instance, some of the [[Domestic pig|swine]] brought by de Soto escaped and became the ancestors of feral [[razorback]] pigs in the [[southeastern United States]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flheritage.com/archaeology/education/desoto/history.cfm |title=Martin/de Soto Site History |accessdate=2010-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511193509/http://www.flheritage.com/archaeology/education/desoto/history.cfm |archivedate=2008-05-11 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hernando de Soto Expedition: History, Historiography, and \"Discovery\" in the Southeast|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zzGphaI83EUC&pg=PA272&lpg=PA272&dq=hernando+de+soto+pigs&q=hernando%20de%20soto%20pigs |last=Galloway |first=Patricia |year=2006 |pages=172\u2013175 |isbn=978-0-8032-7122-7 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncmuseumofhistory.org/collateral/articles/F07.explorers.are.you.pdf |title=Explorers Are You: Tar Heel Junior Historians, Pigs, and Sir Walter Raleigh |author=Joseph C.

Because the indigenous people lacked the immunity which the Europeans had acquired through generations of exposure to these [[Eurasia]]n diseases, [[Native American disease and epidemics|the Native Americans suffered epidemics]] of illness after exposure to such diseases as [[measles]], [[smallpox]], and [[chicken pox]]. Several areas traversed by the expedition became depopulated by disease caused by contact with the Europeans. Seeing the high fatalities and devastation caused, many natives fled the populated areas for the surrounding hills and swamps. In some areas, the social structure changed because of high population losses due to epidemics.<ref>{{cite book | last = Josephy | first = Alvin M., Jr. | title = 500 Nations, An Illustrated History of North American Indians | publisher = Alfred A.

The de Soto expedition's descriptions of North American natives are the earliest-known source of information about the societies in the Southeast. They are the only European description of the culture and habits of North American native tribes before these peoples encountered other Europeans. De Soto's men were both the first and nearly the last Europeans to witness the villages and civilization of the [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nDe Soto's expedition led the Spanish crown to reconsider Spain's attitude toward the colonies north of [[Mexico]]. He claimed large parts of North America for Spain. The Spanish concentrated their missions in the state of [[Florida]] and along the Pacific coast.\n\n== Namesakes ==\n[[File:DeSoto automobile insignia Harrisonburg VA July 2008.jpg|thumb|[[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] Deluxe automobile insignia from early 1950s]]\n\nMany parks, towns, counties, and institutions have been named after Hernando de Soto, to include:\n\n===Places===\n*[[De Soto, Georgia]]\n*[[De Soto, Illinois]]\n*[[De Soto, Iowa]]\n*[[De Soto, Kansas]]\n*[[De Soto, Mississippi]]\n*[[De Soto, Missouri]]\n*[[De Soto, Nebraska]]\n*[[De Soto, Wisconsin]]\n*[[DeSoto, Texas]]\n*[[DeSoto Caverns]], [[Alabama]]\n*[[DeSoto County, Florida]]\n*[[DeSoto County, Mississippi]], and its county seat, [[Hernando, Mississippi|Hernando]]\n*[[DeSoto Falls (Alabama)|DeSoto Falls]], in DeSoto State Park, Alabama\n*[[DeSoto Falls (Georgia)|DeSoto Falls]], in [[Lumpkin County, Georgia]]\n*[[DeSoto Lake]], Georgia\n*[[De Soto National Forest]], in [[Mississippi]]\n*[[De Soto National Memorial]], near [[Bradenton, Florida]], marks the possible location of ''Espiritu Santo'', the point of disembarkation for the expedition.\n*[[DeSoto Parish, Louisiana]]\n*[[DeSoto Site Historic State Park]], Florida\n*[[DeSoto State Park]], [[Alabama]]\n*[[Fort De Soto Park]] in [[Pinellas County, Florida]], named in turn for the 19th-century coastal fortifications at the site\n*[[Hernando, Florida]]\n*[[Hernando County, Florida]]\n\n===Other===\n*[[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto automobile line]] developed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]]\n*[[De Soto Heritage Festival]]\n*[[DeSoto Central High School]], in [[Southaven, Mississippi]]\n*[[DeSoto County High School]], in [[Arcadia, Florida]]\n*DeSoto Hilton Hotel, [[Savannah, Georgia]]\n*[[De Soto High School (Kansas)|De Soto High School]], in De Soto, Kansas\n*De Soto High School, in De Soto, Missouri\n*[[DeSoto High School (Texas)|DeSoto High School]], in DeSoto, Texas\n*De Soto High School, in De Soto, Wisconsin\n*[[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which carries [[Interstate 40]] across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] (opened in 1973)\n*PS 130, Hernando Desoto, a public school in [[New York City]]\n*The De Soto School, a private school in [[Helena, Arkansas]]\n*{{USS|De Soto|1859}}, a Navy steamer that served during the [[American Civil War]] and in the West Indies.\n*{{USS|De Soto|1860}}, a riverboat that was renamed ''General Lyon'' on 24 October 1862.\n*{{USS|DeSoto County|LST-1171}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|United States|Florida|Spain}}\n* [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=yes|viaf=23382263}}\n{{Refbegin}}<!--use smaller font-->\n\n=== Chronicles (in English translations) ===\n*{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Lawrence A.|last2=Knight|first2=Vernon James, Jr.|last3=Moore|first3=Edward C.|title=The De Soto Chronicles, The Expedition of Hernando de Soto to North America in 1539\u20131543|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780817305932|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|isbn=978-0-8173-0824-7}}\n*{{cite book|title=Narratives of the career of Hernando de Soto in the conquest of Florida as told by a knight of Elvas, and in a relation by Luys Hernandez de Biedma, factor of the expedition Volume I|year=1904|publisher=A.

Consonant clusters are almost always at the beginning of a word, with a prefix and a root. Roots in Tzotzil occur in the forms CVC (''t\u02bcul'' \"rabbit\"), CV (''to'' \"still\"), CVCVC (''bik\u02bcit'' \"small\"), CV(C)VC (''xu(v)it'' \"worm\", the second consonant disappears in some dialects), CVC-CVC (''\u02bcajnil'' \"wife\"), CVCV (''\u02bcama'' \"flute\") or CVC-CV (''vo\u02bcne'' \"long ago\"). The most common root is CVC.\n\nAlmost all Tzotzil words can be analyzed as a CVC root together with certain affixes.\n\n===Stress and intonation===\nIn normal speech, stress falls on the first syllable of the root in each word, and the last word in a phrase is heavily stressed. For words in isolation, primary stress falls on the final syllable except in affective verbs with ''-luh'', first person plural exclusive suffixes, and reduplicated stems of two syllables. Then, the stress is unpredictable and so is indicated with an acute accent. The Tzotzil variant of San Bartolom\u00e9 de Los Llanos, in the Venustiano Carranza region, was analyzed as having two phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] by Sarles 1966.<ref>Sarles, Harvey B. 1966.

In final position, b becomes a voiceless m preceded by a glottal stop so ''tzeb'' \"girl\" is pronounced {{IPA|[tse\u0294m\u0325]}}.\n* When adding an affix results in double fricative consonants, only one is pronounced so xx, ss, nn, or jj should be pronounced as x '''[\u0283]''', s.'''[s]''', n '''[n]''', or j '''[h]'''. For example, ''ta ssut'' \"He is returning\" is pronounced [ta sut] . Other double consonants are pronounced twice, like tztz or chch, in verbal construction or in words with the same two consonants appearing in conjoining syllables: ''chchan'' \"He learns it\" is pronounced [t\u0283-t\u0283an].\n* s changes to x when prefixed to a stem beginning with ch, ch\u02bc, or x.\n* x changes to s when prefixed to a stem with an initial or final tz or s.\n\n==Morphology==\nIn Tzotzil, only nouns, verbs, and attributives can be inflected.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns can take affixes of possession, reflexive relation, independent state (absolutive suffix), number, and exclusion, as well as agentives and nominalizing formatives.  Compounds can be formed in three ways:\n\n*nominal root+nominal root ''jol-vitz'' \"summit\" (head-hill)\n*verbal root+nominal root ''k\u02bcat-in-bak'' \"inferno\" (to burn-bone)\n*attributive root/particle+nominal root ''unen-vinik'' \"dwarf\" (small-man)\n\nAn example of a prefix for nouns is ''x-'', an indicator of a non-domesticated animal:  ''x-t\u02bcel'' \"large lizard\"\n\nThe plural suffixes for a noun change based on whether or not the noun is possessed:\n\n*''-t-ik, -ik''.  Plural suffix for possessed nouns, linked with possessive prefixes:  ''s-chikin-ik'' \"his/her/their ears\", ''k-ich\u02bcak-t-ik'' \"our fingernails\"\n*''-et-ik''.  Plural suffix for non-possessed nouns:  ''vitz-et-ik'' \"hills\", ''mut-et-ik'' \"birds\"\n*''-t-ak''.  Plural suffix for objects that come in pairs, or when it is necessary to indicate the plural of both the noun and the possessor: ''j-chikin-t-ak'' \"my (two) ears\", ''s-bi-t-ak'' \"their names\"\n\nSome nouns, such as words for body parts and kinship terms, must always be possessed.  They cannot be used without a possessive prefix, or otherwise must be used with an absolute suffix to express an indefinite possessor.  The possessive prefixes are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| k- / j-\n| k- / j-...-t-ik\n|-\n| av- / a-\n| av- / a-...-ik\n|-\n| y- / s-\n| y- / s-...-ik\n|}\n\nThe prefix listed first is the one used before a root starting with a vowel, the prefix listed second is the one used before a root starting with a consonant.  For example, k+ok ''kok'' \"my foot\", j+ba ''jba'' \"my face\"\n\nThe absolute suffix is usually ''il'' but can also have the form ''el'', ''al'', or ''ol'': ''k\u02bcob-ol'' \"hand (of some unspecified person)\"<ref name=\"Leon\">{{cite book | last = Garc\u00eda de Le\u00f3n | title = ''op. cit.''| year = 1971}}</ref>\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs receive affixes of aspect, tense, pronominal subject and object and formatives of state, voice, mood and number.  They can also form compounds in three ways:\n\n*verb+noun ''tzob-tak\u02bcin'' \"to raise money\"\n*verb+verb ''mukul-milvan'' \"to murder\"\n*attributive+verb ''ch\u02bcul-totin'' \"to become a godfather\"<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n===Attributives===\nAttributives are words that can function as predicates, but are neither verbs nor nouns.  Often they can be translated into English as adjectives.  Unlike verbs, they do not inflect for aspect, and unlike nouns, they cannot head a noun phrase or combine with possessive affixes.  The composition of attributives occurs in three ways:\n\n*verbal root+noun ''ma\u02bc-sat'' \"blind\" (negative-eye)\n\nFor colors:\n\n*attributive of color+verbal root+formative ''-an'' \"shadow, shade (of color)\"   ''k\u02bcan-set\u02bc-an'' \"shade of yellow\"\n*attributive of color reduplicated+t-ik \"type of plural\"   ''tzoj-tzoj-t-ik'' < ''tzoj'' \"red\"  This construction implies intensity in the color.<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n==Syntax==\nThe basic word order of Tzotzil is VOS (verb-object-subject).  Subjects and direct objects are not marked for case.  The predicate agrees in person, and sometimes in number, with its subject and direct object.  Non-emphatic personal pronouns are always left out.<ref name=\"Aissen\">{{cite book | last = Aissen | year = 1987 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n===Verb agreement===\nSince the agreement system in Tzotzil is [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]], the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb are marked by the same set of affixes, while the subject of a transitive is marked with a different set of affixes.  For example, compare the affixes in the following sentences:\n\n*l- '''i-''' ''tal'' '''-otik''' \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) came.\"\n*\u02bci '''j-''' ''pet'' '''-tik''' lok\u02bcel ti vinik -e \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) carried away the man.\"\n\nIn the first sentence, the intransitive verb ''tal'' (\"come\") is affixed by '''-i-...-otik''' to show that the subject is the 1st person plural inclusive \"we,\" but in the second sentence, since the verb  ''pet'' (\"carry\") is transitive, it is affixed by '''j-...-tik''' to mark the subject as the 1st person plural inclusive \"we.\"\n\n*l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\"\n\nFrom this sentence we can see that the 1st person plural inclusive object \"us\" is being marked the same as the 1st person plural inclusive intransitive subject \"we\" using '''-i-...-otik'''.  Thus, '''-i-...-otik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|absolutive]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive and '''j-...-tik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive.\n\nAlso from the sentence l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\" it is possible to see the 3rd person ergative marking s-, which contrasts with the 3rd person absolutive marking \u00d8 in the sentence \u02bci- ''tal'' \"He/she/it/they came.\"<ref name=\"Aissen\"/>\n\n===Enumeration===\nWith many nouns, numbers must be compounded to numeral classifiers that correspond to the physical nature of the object being counted.  This precedes the noun being counted.  For example, in ''vak-p\u02bcej na'' \"six houses\" the classifier ''-p\u02bcej'' \"round things, houses, flowers, etc.\" is compounded to the number ''vak'' \"six\" and precedes the noun ''na'' \"house(s).\"<ref name=\"Haviland\">{{cite book | last = Haviland | year = 1981 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n==Sample lexicon==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Tzeltal, Tzotzil and [[Ch\u02bcol language|Ch\u02bcol]] are the most widely spoken languages in Chiapas.\n\nThere are six dialects of Tzotzil with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility, named after the different regions of Chiapas where they are spoken: [[Chamula]], [[Zinacant\u00e1n]], [[San Andr\u00e9s Larr\u00e1inzar]], [[Huixt\u00e1n]], [[Chenalh\u00f3]], and [[Venustiano Carranza]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MX Ethnologue report for Mexico<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  ''Centro de Lengua, Arte y Literatura Ind\u00edgena'' (CELALI) suggested in 2002 that the name of the language (and the ethnicity) should be spelled Tsotsil, rather than Tzotzil.

Consonant clusters are almost always at the beginning of a word, with a prefix and a root. Roots in Tzotzil occur in the forms CVC (''t\u02bcul'' \"rabbit\"), CV (''to'' \"still\"), CVCVC (''bik\u02bcit'' \"small\"), CV(C)VC (''xu(v)it'' \"worm\", the second consonant disappears in some dialects), CVC-CVC (''\u02bcajnil'' \"wife\"), CVCV (''\u02bcama'' \"flute\") or CVC-CV (''vo\u02bcne'' \"long ago\"). The most common root is CVC.\n\nAlmost all Tzotzil words can be analyzed as a CVC root together with certain affixes.\n\n===Stress and intonation===\nIn normal speech, stress falls on the first syllable of the root in each word, and the last word in a phrase is heavily stressed. For words in isolation, primary stress falls on the final syllable except in affective verbs with ''-luh'', first person plural exclusive suffixes, and reduplicated stems of two syllables. Then, the stress is unpredictable and so is indicated with an acute accent. The Tzotzil variant of San Bartolom\u00e9 de Los Llanos, in the Venustiano Carranza region, was analyzed as having two phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] by Sarles 1966.<ref>Sarles, Harvey B. 1966.

In final position, b becomes a voiceless m preceded by a glottal stop so ''tzeb'' \"girl\" is pronounced {{IPA|[tse\u0294m\u0325]}}.\n* When adding an affix results in double fricative consonants, only one is pronounced so xx, ss, nn, or jj should be pronounced as x '''[\u0283]''', s.'''[s]''', n '''[n]''', or j '''[h]'''. For example, ''ta ssut'' \"He is returning\" is pronounced [ta sut] . Other double consonants are pronounced twice, like tztz or chch, in verbal construction or in words with the same two consonants appearing in conjoining syllables: ''chchan'' \"He learns it\" is pronounced [t\u0283-t\u0283an].\n* s changes to x when prefixed to a stem beginning with ch, ch\u02bc, or x.\n* x changes to s when prefixed to a stem with an initial or final tz or s.\n\n==Morphology==\nIn Tzotzil, only nouns, verbs, and attributives can be inflected.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns can take affixes of possession, reflexive relation, independent state (absolutive suffix), number, and exclusion, as well as agentives and nominalizing formatives.  Compounds can be formed in three ways:\n\n*nominal root+nominal root ''jol-vitz'' \"summit\" (head-hill)\n*verbal root+nominal root ''k\u02bcat-in-bak'' \"inferno\" (to burn-bone)\n*attributive root/particle+nominal root ''unen-vinik'' \"dwarf\" (small-man)\n\nAn example of a prefix for nouns is ''x-'', an indicator of a non-domesticated animal:  ''x-t\u02bcel'' \"large lizard\"\n\nThe plural suffixes for a noun change based on whether or not the noun is possessed:\n\n*''-t-ik, -ik''.  Plural suffix for possessed nouns, linked with possessive prefixes:  ''s-chikin-ik'' \"his/her/their ears\", ''k-ich\u02bcak-t-ik'' \"our fingernails\"\n*''-et-ik''.  Plural suffix for non-possessed nouns:  ''vitz-et-ik'' \"hills\", ''mut-et-ik'' \"birds\"\n*''-t-ak''.  Plural suffix for objects that come in pairs, or when it is necessary to indicate the plural of both the noun and the possessor: ''j-chikin-t-ak'' \"my (two) ears\", ''s-bi-t-ak'' \"their names\"\n\nSome nouns, such as words for body parts and kinship terms, must always be possessed.  They cannot be used without a possessive prefix, or otherwise must be used with an absolute suffix to express an indefinite possessor.  The possessive prefixes are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| k- / j-\n| k- / j-...-t-ik\n|-\n| av- / a-\n| av- / a-...-ik\n|-\n| y- / s-\n| y- / s-...-ik\n|}\n\nThe prefix listed first is the one used before a root starting with a vowel, the prefix listed second is the one used before a root starting with a consonant.  For example, k+ok ''kok'' \"my foot\", j+ba ''jba'' \"my face\"\n\nThe absolute suffix is usually ''il'' but can also have the form ''el'', ''al'', or ''ol'': ''k\u02bcob-ol'' \"hand (of some unspecified person)\"<ref name=\"Leon\">{{cite book | last = Garc\u00eda de Le\u00f3n | title = ''op. cit.''| year = 1971}}</ref>\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs receive affixes of aspect, tense, pronominal subject and object and formatives of state, voice, mood and number.  They can also form compounds in three ways:\n\n*verb+noun ''tzob-tak\u02bcin'' \"to raise money\"\n*verb+verb ''mukul-milvan'' \"to murder\"\n*attributive+verb ''ch\u02bcul-totin'' \"to become a godfather\"<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n===Attributives===\nAttributives are words that can function as predicates, but are neither verbs nor nouns.  Often they can be translated into English as adjectives.  Unlike verbs, they do not inflect for aspect, and unlike nouns, they cannot head a noun phrase or combine with possessive affixes.  The composition of attributives occurs in three ways:\n\n*verbal root+noun ''ma\u02bc-sat'' \"blind\" (negative-eye)\n\nFor colors:\n\n*attributive of color+verbal root+formative ''-an'' \"shadow, shade (of color)\"   ''k\u02bcan-set\u02bc-an'' \"shade of yellow\"\n*attributive of color reduplicated+t-ik \"type of plural\"   ''tzoj-tzoj-t-ik'' < ''tzoj'' \"red\"  This construction implies intensity in the color.<ref name=\"Leon\"/>\n\n==Syntax==\nThe basic word order of Tzotzil is VOS (verb-object-subject).  Subjects and direct objects are not marked for case.  The predicate agrees in person, and sometimes in number, with its subject and direct object.  Non-emphatic personal pronouns are always left out.<ref name=\"Aissen\">{{cite book | last = Aissen | year = 1987 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n===Verb agreement===\nSince the agreement system in Tzotzil is [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]], the subject of an intransitive verb and the direct object of a transitive verb are marked by the same set of affixes, while the subject of a transitive is marked with a different set of affixes.  For example, compare the affixes in the following sentences:\n\n*l- '''i-''' ''tal'' '''-otik''' \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) came.\"\n*\u02bci '''j-''' ''pet'' '''-tik''' lok\u02bcel ti vinik -e \"We ([[clusivity|inclusive]]) carried away the man.\"\n\nIn the first sentence, the intransitive verb ''tal'' (\"come\") is affixed by '''-i-...-otik''' to show that the subject is the 1st person plural inclusive \"we,\" but in the second sentence, since the verb  ''pet'' (\"carry\") is transitive, it is affixed by '''j-...-tik''' to mark the subject as the 1st person plural inclusive \"we.\"\n\n*l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\"\n\nFrom this sentence we can see that the 1st person plural inclusive object \"us\" is being marked the same as the 1st person plural inclusive intransitive subject \"we\" using '''-i-...-otik'''.  Thus, '''-i-...-otik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|absolutive]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive and '''j-...-tik''' is the [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] marker for 1st person plural inclusive.\n\nAlso from the sentence l- '''i-''' s- ''pet'' '''-otik''' \"He carried us ([[clusivity|inclusive]])\" it is possible to see the 3rd person ergative marking s-, which contrasts with the 3rd person absolutive marking \u00d8 in the sentence \u02bci- ''tal'' \"He/she/it/they came.\"<ref name=\"Aissen\"/>\n\n===Enumeration===\nWith many nouns, numbers must be compounded to numeral classifiers that correspond to the physical nature of the object being counted.  This precedes the noun being counted.  For example, in ''vak-p\u02bcej na'' \"six houses\" the classifier ''-p\u02bcej'' \"round things, houses, flowers, etc.\" is compounded to the number ''vak'' \"six\" and precedes the noun ''na'' \"house(s).\"<ref name=\"Haviland\">{{cite book | last = Haviland | year = 1981 | title = ''op. cit.'' }}</ref>\n\n==Sample lexicon==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
