Finally, pyramidal [[Pyramidal inversion|inversion]] at the nitrogen atom occurs, as shown by decoelescence of the N-CH<sub>2</sub> resonance in NMR samples that were taken at various decreasing temperatures. The data obtained in these experiments agree with data from the similar tertiary amine [[triethylamine]], leading the authors to conclude that any acyclic trialkylamine with straight-chain moieties will have similar stereodynamics compared to DEMA and triethylamine.\n\n== Usage ==\nDEMA has found use in multiple fields of study including [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR), industrial extraction techniques, and water desalination.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor a [[Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance|<sup>13</sup>C NMR]] experiment, peak shape and instrument sensitivity are important considerations, and these can be optimized by adjusting the magnetic [[Shim (magnetism)|shims]] to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity and optimize peak shape. Samples used to optimize peak shape often fail at low temperatures due to peak broadening. However, DEMA has been shown to be a useful lineshape standard at temperatures down to 140K, due to its low melting point of 130K and liquid state at standard temperature and pressure. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of tar sands with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]]<nowiki/>s are an important source of [[bitumen]], which is extracted using water-[[surfactant]] mixtures.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Lisa D.|last2=Ulrich|first2=Ania C.|date=2015-05|title=Oil sands naphthenic acids: A review of properties, measurement, and treatment|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045653515001046|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=127|pages=276\u2013290|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.02.003}}</ref> Typical surfactants include alcohols, alkaline agents, and short-chain polymers.

Hayford attended a one-room school where his mother was the teacher, then graduated from [[Crosby High School (Belfast, Maine|Crosby High School]] in 1937.\n\nHe entered Tufts College, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in English in 1938 and 1940.

Williams]] for his graduate program in American literature. Although Williams did little publication on the subject himself, he encouraged these graduate students to focus on Melville. The group did research in archives and libraries in order to move beyond the first generation of studies, which treated Melville's writings as reliably autobiographical. The Yale students became key players in the [[Herman Melville#Melville revival and Melville studies|Melville Revival]] of the 1940s. Among them were [[Walter Bezanson]] and [[Merton M. Sealts]] (Sealts had been a classmate of Hayford's wife at Wooster College).{{sfnb|McLellan|2001|}} Hayford had intended to write his doctoral thesis on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], but when he found that he could not gain access to crucial archival papers, he turned to Melville. His dissertation on the relationship between Melville and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] has been called \u201cseminal.\" Hayford discovered letters, journal extracts, and other materials which he later included in articles.<ref name=\"Marovits \" >Sanford Marovitz, \"The Melville Revival,\" in Wyn Kelley: ''A Companion to Herman Melville''.

Howard\u2019s 1951 biography was dedicated to Hayford and Leyda. {{sfnb|Spark|2006|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0AsRZRwYjEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Hayford&f=false  361]}}\n\nIn 1945, [[Tyrus Hilway]], another student of Stanley Williams, founded the [[Melville Society]]. The prominent scholar of American literature [[F.O. Matthiessen]] disapproved of the idea, recalled Hilway, perhaps because he believed that there were already too many literary societies or that Melville did not merit one.{{sfnb|Spark|2006| p = 352}}\n\n==Textual editing== \nLiterary study in the 1940s was dominated by the [[New Criticism]], an approach that focused on close reading of texts and downplayed or excluded the author's life or historical situation. Hayford later remarked that \"Just by looking closely at a piece of writing, they saw a lot of things that nobody else had noticed before. But you take people with PhDs, who are expected to be scholars, and you tell them that they have to find something new -- well, the first 5 may come up with something, but when you have 50 people looking, the text gets used up.\" These critics also did not often question whether the texts themselves were reliable. The ideal of [[textual criticism]] was to establish the author's intention, which might well have been lost when the publisher edited the original manuscript or distorted when the printer set type.{{sfnb|Sandlin|1982| }}\n\n===Billy Budd===\nMelville left loose pages of the draft manuscript of ''[[Billy Budd]]'' in disorder on his desk when he died in 1893. Melville's first biographer, [[Raymond Weaver]] found these pages among the papers made available to him by Melville's grand-daughter. Weaver produced a text for a collected edition of Melville's works in 1928, but he did not have experience with Melville's difficult handwriting and could only guess at Melville's intentions. Another version published in 1948 reproduced many of Weaver's misreadings and added other mistakes.<ref name=\"Tanselle\"/>\n\nIn 1955, Hayford and [[Merton M. Sealts]] started to study the manuscript, which had been deposited in Harvard's [[Houghton Library]], and published their findings in a 1962 University of Chicago Press book. They found that neither of the two previous editors had realized that Melville's wife had begun to prepare the manuscript for publication, but could not resolve the many difficulties and gave up. The two earlier editors did not recognize that many of the comments were in her handwriting, not her husband's; they printed her queries and notes as if they were Melville's own. Weaver found loose sheets in a separate folder marked \"Preface?\" and printed them as the Preface. Hayford and Sealts recognized that she had come across the folder and guessed that it was a Preface\u2014hence the question mark. The earlier editors also mistakenly assumed that the pages of the manuscript were in the sequence Melville intended. Hayford and Sealts corrected readings of many words, distinguished the types of papers to show the order in which they were written, observed how Melville's handwriting and writing instruments changed over the years, and noted his use of crayons and inks of different colors. They determined the stages in which Melville developed the plot. To show readers these stages, they prepared a \"genetic text\" that used a system of markings and symbols to show the history of each leaf, indicate crossings-out and insertions, marginal notes and who made them, and alternative readings.

A basic task was to assemble a collection of Melville editions and research materials. The Newberry's Herman Melville Collection at its height contained more than 6,100 items. The core was Hayford\u2019s personal collection, augmented through purchases and gifts. The collection was enlarged to include at least one copy of every printing of each of Melville's books published in his lifetime, since Melville might possibly have made textual changes, and to accumulate copies of articles and reviews on Melville.<ref>{{citation| url = https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections/registry/hc.0947 | title = Herman Melville Collection, 1846-present | publisher = Council on Library and Information Resources |year = 2012| ref = none}}</ref> When the collection was broken up, many of the contents were transferred to the Melville Society.<ref>\u201c[http://robertsandberg.net/many-rooms-herman-melville-analog-beginnings-digital-present/ The Many \u2018Rooms\u2019 of Herman Melville \u2013 Analog Beginnings to the Digital Present]\u201d  [http://robertsandberg.net/category/education/ Robert Allen Sandberg], (21 December 2012)</ref>\n\nEstablishing a reliable text was not simple. The first printing of a book might not represent the author's intentions: Melville's handwriting was cramped, misreadings and typographical errors were common, and Melville was impatient with proofreading. In addition, publishers censored or cut many of his early books and Melville made changes and corrections on the page proofs or inserted new material. It was also possible that any edition published during the author's life might have his own corrections or changes. Hayford studied the techniques of [[textual criticism]] that bibliographers such as [[Fredson Bowers]] had developed to analyze Elizabethan texts. The textual editor was to first chose a \"copy text,\" then compare all other possible texts with it. Punctuation and spelling were known as \"accidentals,\" since they had probably been decided on by the publishing house. Hayford's graduate students and editorial assistants later recalled reading copy-texts aloud word by word, including spelling and punctuation, in order to check against other editions.{{sfnb|Students |2003| p = ??}}\n\nThe editorial team compared editions using a [[Hinman collator]], a device used by astronomers to discover changes among the stars by comparing successive images. \"You can look through a whole text and not find any changes,\" Hayford said. \"But that doesn't mean you've been wasting your time. You've found out a great deal. You found that the text is healthy. Some are absolutely cancerous.\"{{sfnb|Sandlin|1982| }} Important corrections to accepted texts emerged almost immediately. ''Moby-Dick'', for instance, was printed in London without the last chapter but with other substantive changes that only the author might have made. Correcting even a single word might affect interpretation. The Harvard literary historian [[F.O. Matthiessen]] expounded on meaning of the phrase \"''soiled'' fish of the sea,\" a phrase, however, that was a typesetter's misreading of \"''coiled'' fish of the sea.\" <ref name=\"Literary Editions\" /> {{sfnb|Fritz|2017}}\n\nThe first volume of the Northwestern-Newberry edition to be published was ''[[Typee]]'', which appeared in 1968. Edmund Wilson's \"The Fruits of the MLA\" reviewed the volume in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' and renewed the attack on the CEAA. Wilson quoted from the CEAA guidelines and wrote that he was \"prepared to acknowledge the competence of Mr. Harrison Hayford, Mr. Hershel Parker, and Mr. G. Thomas Taselle [sic] in the stultifying task assigned them,\" but that they are sometimes as much bored and annoyed as the reviewer is by these exactions; but the project in the case of ''Typee'' has been so relentlessley carried out that in the technical language of this species of scholarship\u2014of 'substantives,' 'accidentals,' and 'copy-texts' -- that a glossary should be provided for readers who are not registered union members\u2014if there are any such readers\u2014of the Modern Language Association.\" <ref>quoted in {{cite book |last = Parker |first =  Hershel  |year = 2012 |title = Melville Biography: An inside Narrative  |publisher = Northwestern University Press| location = Evanston, Ill.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxIvoghIdJQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn = 9780810127098 |ref = none}}, pp. 41-43</ref>\n\nOther reviewers praised the edition's textual scholarship for establishing reliable texts. Some questioned particular decisions behind the reading texts, however. Julian Markels, writing in the journal ''[[American Literature]]'' charged that Hayford and Sealts had been wrong to remove the \"Preface\" from Billy Budd. He also charged that Hayford used his position as General Editor to push his thesis that ''Moby-Dick'' contained \"unnecessary duplicates\" and that he excluded other interpretations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Markels |first=Julian |title=The Moby-Dick White Elephant |journal=American Literature |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=105\u2013122 |year=1994 |jstor=2927435 |doi=10.2307/2927435|ref= harv}}</ref> Robert Milder, reviewing several volumes published in the mid-1990s, remarked that the ratio of material in the appendices in the earlier volumes was roughly two to one, but that the Northwestern-Newberry editors had greatly expanded the material in the historical and critical appendices in the recent volumes. The edition \"quite simply reinvented itself and in so doing redefined what a scholarly volume can and perhaps ought to be.\"  Milder cautioned, however, \"no firm and abiding principle governs the inclusion or exclusion of material.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Milder |first=Robert |title=Review: Editing Melville's Afterlife |journal=Text |volume =9 |issue = |pages=394 |date=1996 |jstor=20698031}}</ref>\n\nNorthwestern-Newberry texts soon were accepted as standard and widely reprinted. Because the National Endowment for the Humanities funded the project, the texts were not copyright, and there was no fee to reprint them. Edmund Wilson and Jason Epstein's vision  came to fruition in the [[Library of America]]. The first volume in the series was devoted to Melville, edited by G. Thomas Tanselle, and Hayford edited a later volume. The texts were those established by the Northwestern- Newberry editions.<ref name=\"Skinner \" />\n\n==Literary history and criticism==\nAfter his death in 2001, Northwestern University Press published a collection of Hayford's selected and revised essays, ''Melville's Prisoners'' (2003), with an extensive introduction by Hershel Parker. {{sfnb|Hayford|2003|}} John Bryant's review in ''Leviathan'' notes that it contains both \"scholarly-critical essays,\" in which textual history and bibliographical facts shape and inform critical insight, but also ''explication de texte'', source study, and biography. {{sfnb|Bryant|2006| p = 88}}\n\n==Book collecting==\nHayford was also known to friends and students as a book-lover and collector. His essay \"An Apology for Book Accumulating,\" however, argued that there was value in accumulating books without narrowing the reasons. He defended a collection of Twentieth Century Second Rate Fiction on the grounds that bad literature was also part of the record.{{sfnb|Students|2003| p= 71-72, 83}}\n\nOne former student estimated that some 200,000 volumes must have passed through Hayford's house over the course of his career, also filling his attic, basement, and garage. He began to accumulate books in large numbers after 1965. Since he then could buy Melville books only for the Newberry Melville collection, his attention turned to other topics. Although he was generous in giving books to graduate students, he sold or donated from this stock only to college or university libraries in thematic groups, such as American fiction, humor, and poetry. He devoted special attention to areas that were then less developed, such as writings by women and African Americans, in order to encourage research. In addition to the Newberry Library, large collections went to Purdue University, Western Michigan University, University of Toledo, and Meiji University in Tokyo. {{sfnb|Students|2003| p= 71-72, 83}}\n\nIn 1990, he and his wife donated  \"The Josephine Long Wishart Collection: Mother, Home, and Heaven,\" a collection of more than 800 books by and about American women, to Wooster College to provide research material for the college's undergraduate research program. {{sfnb|Gilgenbach|1993}} The collection honors Josephine Long Wishart,  his wife's mother and wife of former Wooster president [[Charles F.

Williams]] for his graduate program in American literature. Although Williams did little publication on the subject himself, he encouraged these graduate students to focus on Melville. The group did research in archives and libraries in order to move beyond the first generation of studies, which treated Melville's writings as reliably autobiographical. The Yale students became key players in the [[Herman Melville#Melville revival and Melville studies|Melville Revival]] of the 1940s. Among them were [[Walter Bezanson]] and [[Merton M. Sealts]] (Sealts had been a classmate of Hayford's wife at Wooster College).{{sfnb|McLellan|2001|}} Hayford had intended to write his doctoral thesis on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], but when he found that he could not gain access to crucial archival papers, he turned to Melville.

Howard\u2019s 1951 biography was dedicated to Hayford and Leyda. {{sfnb|Spark|2006|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0AsRZRwYjEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Hayford&f=false  361]}} \n\nIn 1945, [[Tyrus Hilway]], another student of Stanley Williams, founded the [[Melville Society]]. The prominent scholar of American literature [[F.O. Matthiessen]] disapproved of the idea, recalled Hilway, perhaps because he believed that there were already too many literary societies or that Melville did not merit one.{{sfnb|Spark|2006| p = 352}}\n\n==Textual editing== \nLiterary study in the 1940s was dominated by the [[New Criticism]], an approach that focused on close reading of texts and downplayed or excluded the author's life or historical situation. Hayford later remarked that \"Just by looking closely at a piece of writing, they saw a lot of things that nobody else had noticed before. But you take people with PhDs, who are expected to be scholars, and you tell them that they have to find something new -- well, the first 5 may come up with something, but when you have 50 people looking, the text gets used up.\" These critics also did not often question whether the texts themselves were reliable. The ideal of [[textual criticism]] was to establish the author's intention, which might well have been lost when the publisher edited the original manuscript or distorted when the printer set type.{{sfnb|Sandlin|1982| }}\n\n===Billy Budd===\nMelville left loose pages of the draft manuscript of ''[[Billy Budd]]'' in disorder on his desk when he died in 1893. Melville's first biographer, [[Raymond Weaver]] found these pages among the papers made available to him by Melville's grand-daughter. Weaver produced a text for a collected edition of Melville's works in 1928, but he did not have experience with Melville's difficult handwriting and could only guess at Melville's intentions. Another version published in 1948 reproduced many of Weaver's misreadings and added other mistakes.<ref name=\"Tanselle\"/> \n\nIn 1955, Hayford and [[Merton M. Sealts]] started to study the manuscript, which had been deposited in Harvard's [[Houghton Library]], and published their findings in a 1962 University of Chicago Press book. They found that neither of the two previous editors had realized that Melville's wife had begun to prepare the manuscript for publication, but could not resolve the many difficulties and gave up. The two earlier editors did not recognize that many of the comments were in her handwriting, not her husband's; they printed her queries and notes as if they were Melville's own. Weaver found loose sheets in a separate folder marked \"Preface?\" and printed them as the Preface. Hayford and Sealts recognized that she had come across the folder and guessed that it was a Preface -- hence the question mark. The earlier editors also mistakenly assumed that the pages of the manuscript were in the sequence Melville intended. Hayford and Sealts corrected readings of many words, distinguished the types of papers to show the order in which they were written, observed how Melville's handwriting and writing instruments changed over the years, and noted his use of crayons and inks of different colors. They determined the stages in which Melville developed the plot. To show readers these stages, they prepared a \"genetic text\" that used a system of markings and symbols to show the history of each leaf, indicate crossings-out and insertions, marginal notes and who made them, and alternative readings. [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] called the genetic text an \"historic achievement\" that made all the textual evidence available for scholars to construct \"reading texts.\" The 1962 University of Chicago volume included both the genetic text and a reading text, which Sealts prepared.<ref name=\"Tanselle\"> G.

A basic task was to assemble a collection of Melville editions and research materials. The Newberry's Herman Melville Collection at its height contained more than 6,100 items. The core was Hayford\u2019s personal collection, augmented through purchases and gifts. The collection was enlarged to include at least one copy of every printing of each of Melville's books published in his lifetime, since Melville might possibly have made textual changes, and to accumulate copies of articles and reviews on Melville. <ref>{{citation| url = https://www.clir.org/hiddencollections/registry/hc.0947 | title = Herman Melville Collection, 1846-present | publisher = Council on Library and Information Resources |year = 2012| ref = none}}</ref> When the collection was broken up, many of the contents were transferred to the Melville Society. <ref>\u201c[http://robertsandberg.net/many-rooms-herman-melville-analog-beginnings-digital-present/ The Many \u2018Rooms\u2019 of Herman Melville \u2013 Analog Beginnings to the Digital Present]\u201d  [http://robertsandberg.net/category/education/ Robert Allen Sandberg], (21 December 2012) </ref>\n\nEstablishing a reliable text was not simple. The first printing of a book might not represent the author's intentions: Melville's handwriting was cramped, misreadings and typographical errors were common, and Melville was impatient with proofreading. In addition, publishers censored or cut many of his early books and Melville made changes and corrections on the page proofs or inserted new material. It was also possible that any edition published during the author's life might have his own corrections or changes. Hayford studied the techniques of [[textual criticism]] that bibliographers such as [[Fredson Bowers]] had developed to analyze Elizabethan texts. The textual editor was to first chose a \"copy text,\" then compare all other possible texts with it. Punctuation and spelling were known as \"accidentals,\" since they had probably been decided on by the publishing house. Hayford's graduate students and editorial assistants later recalled reading copy-texts aloud word by word, including spelling and punctuation, in order to check against other editions.{{sfnb|Students |2003| p = ??}}\n\nThe editorial team compared editions using a [[Hinman collator]], a device used by astronomers to discover changes among the stars by comparing successive images. \"You can look through a whole text and not find any changes,\" Hayford said. \"But that doesn't mean you've been wasting your time. You've found out a great deal. You found that the text is healthy. Some are absolutely cancerous.\"{{sfnb|Sandlin|1982| }} Important corrections to accepted texts emerged almost immediately. ''Moby-Dick'', for instance, was printed in London without the last chapter but with other substantive changes that only the author might have made. Correcting even a single word might affect interpretation. The Harvard literary historian [[F.O. Matthiessen]] expounded on meaning of the phrase \"''soiled'' fish of the sea,\" a phrase, however, that was a typesetter's misreading of \"''coiled'' fish of the sea.\" <ref name=\"Literary Editions\" /> {{sfnb|Fritz|2017}}\n\nThe first volume of the Northwestern-Newberry edition to be published was ''[[Typee]]'', which appeared in 1968. Edmund Wilson's \"The Fruits of the MLA\" reviewed the volume in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' and renewed the attack on the CEAA. Wilson quoted from the CEAA guidelines and wrote that he was \"prepared to acknowledge the competence of Mr. Harrison Hayford, Mr. Hershel Parker, and Mr. G. Thomas Taselle [sic] in the stultifying task assigned them,\" but that they are sometimes as much bored and annoyed as the reviewer is by these exactions; but the project in the case of ''Typee'' has been so relentlessley carried out that in the technical language of this species of scholarship -- of 'substantives,' 'accidentals,' and 'copy-texts' -- that a glossary should be provided for readers who are not registered union members -- if there are any such readers -- of the Modern Language Association.\" <ref>quoted in {{cite book |last = Parker |first =  Hershel  |year = 2012 |title = Melville Biography: An inside Narrative  |publisher = Northwestern University Press| location = Evanston, Ill.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxIvoghIdJQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn = 9780810127098 |ref = none}}, pp. 41-43</ref>\n\nOther reviewers praised the edition's textual scholarship for establishing reliable texts. Some questioned particular decisions behind the reading texts, however. Julian Markels, writing in the journal ''[[American Literature]]'' charged that Hayford and Sealts had been wrong to remove the \"Preface\" from Billy Budd. He also charged that Hayford used his position as General Editor to push his thesis that ''Moby-Dick'' contained \"unnecessary duplicates\" and that he excluded other interpretations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Markels |first=Julian |title=The Moby-Dick White Elephant |journal=American Literature |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=105\u2013122 |year=1994 |jstor=2927435 |doi=10.2307/2927435|ref= harv}}</ref> Robert Milder, reviewing several volumes published in the mid-1990s, remarked that the ratio of material in the appendices in the earlier volumes was roughly two to one, but that the Northwestern-Newberry editors had greatly expanded the material in the historical and critical appendices in the recent volumes. The edition \"quite simply reinvented itself and in so doing redefined what a scholarly volume can and perhaps ought to be.\"  Milder cautioned, however, \"no firm and abiding principle governs the inclusion or exclusion of material.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Milder |first=Robert |title=Review: Editing Melville's Afterlife |journal=Text |volume =9 |issue = |pages=394 |date=1996 |jstor=20698031}}</ref>\n\nNorthwestern-Newberry texts soon were accepted as standard and widely reprinted. Because the National Endowment for the Humanities funded the project, the texts were not copyright, and there was no fee to reprint them. Edmund Wilson and Jason Epstein's vision  came to fruition in the [[Library of America]]. The first volume in the series was devoted to Melville, edited by G. Thomas Tanselle, and Hayford edited a later volume. The texts were those established by the Northwestern- Newberry editions.<ref name=\"Skinner \" />\n\n==Literary history and criticism==\nAfter his death in 2001, Northwestern University Press published a collection of Hayford's selected and revised essays, ''Melville's Prisoners'' (2003), with an extensive introduction by Hershel Parker. {{sfnb|Hayford|2003|}} John Bryant's review in ''Leviathan'' notes that it contains both \"scholarly-critical essays,\" in which textual history and bibliographical facts shape and inform critical insight, but also ''explication de texte'', source study, and biography. {{sfnb|Bryant|2006| p = 88}}\n\n==Book collecting==\nHayford was also known to friends and students as a book-lover and collector. His essay \"An Apology for Book Accumulating,\" however, argued that there was value in accumulating books without narrowing the reasons. He defended a collection of Twentieth Century Second Rate Fiction on the grounds that bad literature was also part of the record.{{sfnb|Students|2003| p= 71-72, 83}} \n\nOne former student estimated that some 200,000 volumes must have passed through Hayford's house over the course of his career, also filling his attic, basement, and garage. He began to accumulate books in large numbers after 1965. Since he then could buy Melville books only for the Newberry Melville collection, his attention turned to other topics. Although he was generous in giving books to graduate students, he sold or donated from this stock only to college or university libraries in thematic groups, such as American fiction, humor, and poetry. He devoted special attention to areas that were then less developed, such as writings by women and African Americans, in order to encourage research. In addition to the Newberry Library, large collections went to Purdue University, Western Michigan University, University of Toledo, and Meiji University in Tokyo. {{sfnb|Students|2003| p= 71-72, 83}} \n\nIn 1990, he and his wife donated  \"The Josephine Long Wishart Collection: Mother, Home, and Heaven,\" a collection of more than 800 books by and about American women, to Wooster College to provide research material for the college's undergraduate research program. {{sfnb|Gilgenbach|1993}} The collection honors Josephine Long Wishart,  his wife's mother and wife of former Wooster president [[Charles F.

Most stars carry out transmutation through fusion reactions involving [[hydrogen]] and helium, while much larger stars are also capable of fusing heavier elements up to [[iron]] late in their evolution.\n\nElements heavier than iron, such as [[gold]] or [[lead]], are created through elemental transmutations that can only naturally occur in [[Supernova|supernovae]].  As stars begin to fuse heavier elements, substantially less energy is released from each fusion reaction. Reactions that produce elements heavier than iron are [[Endothermic process|endothermic]]  and unable to generate the energy required to maintain stable fusion inside the star.\n\nOne type of natural transmutation observable in the present occurs when certain [[radioactive]] elements present in nature spontaneously decay by a process that causes transmutation, such as [[alpha decay|alpha]] or [[beta decay]]. An example is the natural decay of [[potassium-40]] to [[argon-40]], which forms most of the [[argon]] in the air. Also on Earth, natural transmutations from the different mechanisms of ''natural [[nuclear reaction]]s'' occur, due to [[cosmic ray]] bombardment of elements (for example, to form [[carbon-14]]), and also occasionally from natural neutron bombardment (for example, see [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]).\n\nArtificial transmutation may occur in machinery that has enough energy to cause changes in the nuclear structure of the elements. Such machines include [[particle accelerator]]s and [[tokamak]] reactors. Conventional [[Nuclear fission#Fission reactors|fission power reactors]] also cause artificial transmutation, not from the power of the machine, but by exposing elements to [[neutron]]s produced by fission from an artificially produced [[nuclear chain reaction]]. For instance, when a uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons, fission takes place. This releases, on average, 3 neutrons and a large amount of energy. The released neutrons then cause fission of other uranium atoms, until all of the available uranium is exhausted. This is called a [[chain reaction]].\n\nArtificial nuclear transmutation has been considered as a possible mechanism for reducing the volume and hazard of [[radioactive waste]].<ref>http://www.oecd-nea.org/trw/ \"Transmutation of Radioactive Waste.\" Nuclear Energy Agency. Feb 3rd 2012.</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Alchemy===\nThe term ''transmutation'' dates back to [[alchemy]]. Alchemists pursued the [[philosopher's stone]], capable of [[chrysopoeia]] &ndash; the transformation of [[base metal]]s into gold.<ref>{{citation |contribution=Alchemy |contribution-url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alchemy |title=Dictionary.com}}</ref> While alchemists often understood chrysopoeia as a metaphor for a mystical, or religious process, some practitioners adopted a literal interpretation, and tried to make gold through physical experiment. The impossibility of the metallic transmutation had been debated amongst alchemists, philosophers and scientists since the Middle Ages. Pseudo-alchemical transmutation was outlawed<ref>John Hines, II, R. F. Yeager. ''John Gower, Trilingual Poet: Language, Translation, and Tradition.'' Boydell & Brewer.  2010.  p.170</ref> and publicly mocked beginning in the fourteenth century. Alchemists like [[Michael Maier]] and [[Heinrich Khunrath]] wrote tracts exposing fraudulent claims of gold making. By the 1720s, there were no longer any respectable figures pursuing the physical transmutation of substances into gold.<ref>Lawrence Principe. ''New Narratives in Eighteenth-Century Chemistry''. Springer. 2007. p.8</ref> [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in the 18th century, replaced the [[Classical element#Elements in Medieval alchemy|alchemical theory of elements]] with the modern theory of chemical elements, and [[John Dalton]] further developed the notion of atoms (from the alchemical theory of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]]) to explain various chemical processes. The disintegration of atoms is a distinct process involving much greater energies than could be achieved by alchemists.\n\n===Modern physics===\nIt was first consciously applied to modern physics by [[Frederick Soddy]] when he, along with [[Ernest Rutherford]], discovered that radioactive [[thorium]] was converting itself into [[radium]] in 1901. At the moment of realization, Soddy later recalled, he shouted out: \"Rutherford, this is transmutation!\" Rutherford snapped back, \"For Christ's sake, Soddy, don't call it ''transmutation''. They'll have our heads off as alchemists.\"<ref>Muriel Howorth, ''Pioneer Research on the Atom: The Life Story of Frederick Soddy'', New World, London 1958, pp 83-84; Lawrence Badash, Radium, ''Radioactivity and the Popularity of Scientific Discovery'', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 122,1978: 145-54; Thaddeus J. Trenn, ''The Self-Splitting Atom: The History of the Rutherford-Soddy Collaboration'', Taylor & Francis, London, 1977, pp 42, 58-60, 111-17.</ref>\n\nRutherford and Soddy were observing natural transmutation as a part of [[radioactive decay]] of the [[alpha decay]] type. The first artificial transmutation was accomplished in 1925 by [[Patrick Blackett]], a research fellow working under Rutherford, with the transmutation of nitrogen into [[Oxygen-17|oxygen]], using alpha particles directed at nitrogen <sup>14</sup>N + \u03b1 \u2192 [[Oxygen-17|<sup>17</sup>O]] + p.&nbsp; <ref> http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/rutherford/sections/atop-physics-wave.html</ref> Rutherford had shown in 1919 that a proton (he called it a hydrogen atom) was emitted from alpha bombardment experiments but he had no information about the residual nucleus. Blackett's 1921-1924 experiments provided the first experimental evidence of an artificial nuclear transmutation reaction. Blackett correctly identified the underlying integration process and the identity of the residual nucleus. In 1932, a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherford's colleagues [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7 to split the nucleus into two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom,\" although it was not the modern [[nuclear fission]] reaction discovered in 1938 by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]] and their assistant Fritz Strassmann in heavy elements.<ref>[http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm Cockcroft and Walton split lithium with high energy protons April 1932. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902195556/http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm |date=2012-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nLater in the twentieth century the transmutation of elements within stars was elaborated, accounting for the relative abundance of heavier elements in the universe. Save for the first five elements, which were produced in the Big Bang and other [[cosmic ray]] processes, stellar nucleosynthesis accounted for the abundance of all elements heavier than [[boron]]. In their 1957 paper ''[[Synthesis of the Elements in Stars]]'',<ref>William Alfred Fowler, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, and Fred Hoyle, 'Synthesis of the Elements in Stars', ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', vol. 29, Issue 4, pp. 547\u2013650</ref> [[William Alfred Fowler]], [[Margaret Burbidge]], [[Geoffrey Burbidge]], and [[Fred Hoyle]] explained how the abundances of essentially all but the lightest chemical elements could be explained by the process of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars.\n\nIt transpired that, under true nuclear transmutation, it is far easier to turn gold into lead than the reverse reaction, which was the one the alchemists had ardently pursued. Nuclear experiments have successfully transmuted lead into gold, but the expense far exceeds any gain.<ref>Anne Marie Helmenstine, [http://chemistry.about.com/cs/generalchemistry/a/aa050601a.htm Turning Lead into Gold: Is Alchemy Real?], About.com:Chemistry, retrieved January 2008</ref> It would be easier to convert lead into gold via [[neutron capture]] and [[beta decay]] by leaving lead in a nuclear reactor for a long period of time.\n\n[[Glenn T. Seaborg#Return to California|Glenn Seaborg produced several thousand atoms of gold from bismuth]], but at a net loss.\n\nMore information on gold synthesis, see [[Synthesis of precious metals]].\n\n<sup>197</sup>{{gold}} + [[neutron capture|n]] \u2192 <sup>198</sup>Au ([[half-life]] 2.7 days) \u2192 <sup>198</sup>{{mercury}} + n \u2192 <sup>199</sup>Hg + n \u2192 <sup>200</sup>Hg + n \u2192 <sup>201</sup>Hg + n \u2192 <sup>202</sup>Hg + n \u2192 <sup>203</sup>Hg (halflife 47 days) \u2192 <sup>203</sup>{{thallium}} + n \u2192 <sup>204</sup>Tl (halflife 3.8 years) \u2192 <sup>204</sup>[[Lead|Pb]]\n\n==Transmutation in the universe==\n{{main|Nucleosynthesis}}\nThe [[Big Bang]] is thought to be the origin of the hydrogen (including all [[deuterium]]) and helium in the universe. Hydrogen and helium together account for 98% of the mass of ordinary matter in the universe, while the other 2% makes up everything else. The Big Bang also produced small amounts of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and perhaps [[boron]]. More lithium, beryllium and boron were produced later, in a natural nuclear reaction, [[cosmic ray spallation]].\n\n[[Stellar nucleosynthesis]] is responsible for all of the other elements occurring naturally in the universe as [[stable isotopes]] and [[primordial nuclide]], from [[carbon]] to [[uranium]]. These occurred after the Big Bang, during star formation. Some lighter elements from carbon to iron were formed in stars and released into space by [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) stars. These are a type of red giant that \"puffs\" off its outer atmosphere, containing some elements from carbon to nickel and iron. All elements with [[atomic weight]] greater than 64 [[atomic mass unit]]s are produced in [[supernova]] stars by means of [[neutron capture]], which sub-divides into two processes: [[r-process]] and [[s-process]].\n\nThe [[Solar System]] is thought to have condensed approximately 4.6 billion years before the present, from a cloud of hydrogen and helium containing heavier elements in dust grains formed previously by a large number of such stars. These grains contained the heavier elements formed by transmutation earlier in the history of the universe.\n\nAll of these natural processes of transmutation in stars are continuing today, in our own galaxy and in others. Stars fuse hydrogen and helium into heavier and heavier elements in order to produce energy. For example, the observed light curves of supernova stars such as [[SN 1987A]] show them blasting large amounts (comparable to the mass of Earth) of radioactive nickel and cobalt into space. However, little of this material reaches Earth. Most natural transmutation on the Earth today is mediated by [[cosmic rays]] (such as production of [[carbon-14]]) and by the radioactive decay of radioactive [[primordial nuclide]]s left over from the initial formation of the solar system (such as [[potassium-40]], uranium and thorium), plus the radioactive decay of products of these nuclides (radium, radon, polonium, etc.). See [[decay chain]].\n\n=={{Anchor|Nuclear waste}}Artificial transmutation of nuclear waste==\n\n===Overview===\nTransmutation of [[transuranium element]]s (TRUs, i.e. [[actinides]] minus [[actinium]] to [[uranium]]) such as the [[isotope]]s of [[plutonium]] (about 1wt% in the [[Light Water Reactor]]s' used [[nuclear fuel]] (UNF)) or the minor actinides (MAs, i.e. [[neptunium]], [[americium]], and [[curium]], about 0.1wt% each in LWRs' UNF) has the potential to help solve some problems posed by the management of [[radioactive waste]] by reducing the proportion of long-lived isotopes it contains. (This does not rule out the need for a [[Deep geological repository|Deep Geological Repository]] (DGR) for [[High-level waste|High radioactive Level Waste]] (HLW).) When irradiated with [[fast neutrons]] in a [[nuclear reactor]], these isotopes can  undergo [[nuclear fission]], destroying the original [[actinide]] isotope and producing a spectrum of radioactive and nonradioactive [[fission products]].\n\nCeramic targets containing actinides can be bombarded with neutrons to induce transmutation reactions to remove the most difficult long-lived species. These can consist of actinide-containing solid solutions such as (Am,Zr)N, (Am,Y)N, (Zr,Cm)O<sub>2</sub>, (Zr,Cm,Am)O<sub>2</sub>, (Zr,Am,Y)O<sub>2</sub> or just actinide phases such as AmO<sub>2</sub>, NpO<sub>2</sub>, NpN, AmN mixed with some inert phases such as MgO, MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, (Zr,Y)O<sub>2</sub>, TiN and ZrN. The role of non-radioactive inert phases is mainly to provide stable mechanical behaviour to the target under neutron irradiation.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation\n  |url=http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html\n  |publisher=Imperial College Press\n  |location=London\n  |year=2010\n  |page=198\n  |url-status=dead\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093650/http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html\n  |archive-date=9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are issues with this P&T (partitioning and transmutation) strategy however:\n* first, it is limited by the costly and cumbersome need to separate LLFP isotopes before they can undergo transmutation. \n* also, some LLFPs, due to their small neutron capture cross sections, are unable to capture enough neutrons for effective transmutation to occur.\n\nThe new study led by Satoshi Chiba at Tokyo Tech (called \"Method to Reduce Long-lived Fission Products by Nuclear Transmutations with Fast Spectrum Reactors\"<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 5654822|year = 2017|last1 = Chiba|first1 = S.|title = Method to Reduce Long-lived Fission Products by Nuclear Transmutations with Fast Spectrum Reactors|journal = Scientific Reports|volume = 7|issue = 1|pages = 13961|last2 = Wakabayashi|first2 = T.|last3 = Tachi|first3 = Y.|last4 = Takaki|first4 = N.|last5 = Terashima|first5 = A.|last6 = Okumura|first6 = S.|last7 = Yoshida|first7 = T.|pmid = 29066843|doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-14319-7|bibcode = 2017NatSR...713961C}}</ref>) shows that effective transmutation of LLFPs can be achieved in fast spectrum reactors without the need for isotope separation.

Gohar, [[Argonne National Laboratory]]]</ref>\n\n===Fuel types===\nThere are several fuels that can incorporate plutonium in their initial composition at beginning of cycle (BOC) and have a smaller amount of this element at the end of cycle (EOC). During the cycle, plutonium can be burnt in a power reactor, generating electricity. This process is not only interesting from a power generation standpoint, but also due to its capability of consuming the surplus weapons grade plutonium from the weapons program and plutonium resulting of [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] UNF.\n\n[[MOX fuel|Mixed oxide fuel (MOX)]] is one of these. Its blend of oxides of plutonium and uranium constitutes an alternative to the low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel predominantly used in LWRs. Since uranium is present in MOX, although plutonium will be burnt, second generation plutonium will be produced through the radiative capture of U-238 and the two subsequent beta minus decays.\n\nFuels with plutonium and [[thorium]] are also an option. In these, the neutrons released in the fission of plutonium are captured by Th-232. After this radiative capture, Th-232 becomes Th-233, which undergoes two beta minus decays resulting in the production of the fissile isotope U-233. The radiative capture cross section for Th-232 is more than three times that of U-238, yielding a higher conversion to fissile fuel than that from U-238. Due to the absence of uranium in the fuel, there is no second generation plutonium produced, and the amount of plutonium burnt will be higher than in MOX fuels. However, U-233, which is fissile, will be present in the UNF. Weapons-grade and [[reactor-grade plutonium]] can be used in plutonium-thorium fuels, with weapons-grade plutonium being the one that shows a bigger reduction in the amount of Pu-239.\n\n===Reasoning behind transmutation===\nIsotopes of plutonium and other actinides tend to be long-lived with [[half-life|half-lives]] of many thousands of years, whereas radioactive fission products tend to be shorter-lived (most with half-lives of 30 years or less). From a waste management viewpoint, transmutation (or \"burning\" or \"incineration\") of actinides eliminates a very long-term radioactive hazard and replaces it with a much shorter-term one.\n\nIt is important to understand that the threat posed by a radioisotope is influenced by many factors including the [[physical chemistry|physical]] (e.g. heat -infrared photon radiation-, which is an advantage for the storage or disposal af radioactive waste), [[chemical]] and [[biology|biological]] properties of the element. For instance [[caesium]] has a relatively short [[biological half-life]] (1 to 4 months) while [[strontium]] and [[radium]] both have very long biological half-lives. As a result, [[strontium-90]] and radium are much more able to cause harm than [[caesium-137]] when a given activity is ingested. {{Citation needed span|text=Insert a brief calculation of doses |date=February 2016 |reason=Or insert a brief calculation of doses}}\n\nMany of the actinides are very radiotoxic because they have long biological half-lives and are [[alpha particle|alpha]] emitters. In transmutation the intention is to convert the actinides into [[fission products]]. The fission products are very radioactive, but the majority of the activity will decay away within a short time. The most worrying short-lived fission products are those that accumulate in the body, such as [[iodine]]-131 which accumulates in the thyroid gland, but it is hoped{{By whom|date=March 2014}} that by good design of the nuclear fuel and transmutation plant that such fission products can be isolated from humans and their environment and allowed to decay. In the medium term the fission products of highest concern are strontium-90 and caesium-137; both have a half-life of about 30 years. The caesium-137 is responsible for the majority of the external [[gamma radiation|gamma]] dose experienced by workers in [[nuclear reprocessing]] plants<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schwenk-Ferrero|first=A.|title=German Spent Nuclear Fuel Legacy: Characteristics and High-Level Waste Management Issues|journal=Science and Technology of Nuclear Installations|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=293792|doi=10.1155/2013/293792|url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/stni/2013/293792.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> and, in 2005, to workers at the [[Chernobyl]] site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cesium-RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp157-c2.pdf|publisher=cdc.gov|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> When these medium-lived isotopes have decayed almost completely (usually after 10 half-lives) the remaining isotopes will pose a much smaller threat.\n\n===Long-lived fission products (LLFP)===\n{{Long-lived fission products}}{{Medium-lived fission products}}\n{{See also|Nuclear reprocessing#Voloxidation}}\nSome radioactive fission products can be converted into shorter-lived radioisotopes by transmutation. Transmutation of all fission products with half-life greater than one year is studied in Grenoble,<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US4721596 Method for net decrease of hazardous radioactive nuclear waste materials - US Patent 4721596 Description]</ref> with varying results.\n\n[[Sr-90]] and [[Cs-137]], with half-lives of about 30 years, are the largest radiation (including heat) emitters in used nuclear fuel on a scale of decades to ~305 years (Sn-121m is insignificant because of the low yield), and are not easily transmuted because they have low [[neutron absorption]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]]s. Instead, they should simply be stored until they decay. Given that this length of storage is necessary, the fission products with shorter half-lives can also be stored until they decay.\n\nThe next longer-lived fission product is [[Sm-151]], which has a half-life of 90 years, and is such a good neutron absorber that most of it is transmuted while the nuclear fuel is still being used; however, effectively transmuting the remaining Sm-151 in nuclear waste would require separation from other isotopes of [[samarium]]. Given the smaller quantities and its low-energy radioactivity, Sm-151 is less dangerous than Sr-90 and Cs-137 and can also be left to decay for ~970 years.\n\nFinally, there are 7 [[long-lived fission product]]s. They have much longer half-lives in the range 211,000 years to 15.7 million years. Two of them, [[Tc-99]] and [[Iodine-129|I-129]], are mobile enough in the environment to be potential dangers, are free or mostly free of mixture with stable isotopes of the same element, and have neutron cross sections that are small but adequate to support transmutation.\nAlso, Tc-99 can substitute for [[Uranium-238|U-238]] in supplying [[Doppler broadening]] for negative feedback for reactor stability.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10180577-PCAEyE/10180577.PDF Transmutation of Selected Fission Products in a Fast Reactor]</ref>\nMost studies of proposed transmutation schemes have assumed [[technetium|<sup>99</sup>Tc]], [[Iodine-129|<sup>129</sup>I]], and TRUs as the targets for transmutation, with other fission products, [[activation products]], and possibly [[reprocessed uranium]] remaining as waste.<ref>[http://www.ieer.org/reports/transm/report.pdf The Nuclear Alchemy Gamble - Institute for Energy and Environmental Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOf the remaining 5 long-lived fission products, [[Se-79]], [[Sn-126]] and [[Pd-107]] are produced only in small quantities (at least in today's [[thermal neutron]], [[Uranium-235|U-235]]-burning [[light water reactors]]) and the last two should be relatively inert. The other two, [[Zr-93]] and [[Cs-135]], are produced in larger quantities, but also not highly mobile in the environment.

Most stars carry out transmutation through fusion reactions involving [[hydrogen]] and helium, while much larger stars are also capable of fusing heavier elements up to [[iron]] late in their evolution.\n\nElements heavier than iron, such as [[gold]] or [[lead]], are created through elemental transmutations that can only naturally occur in [[Supernova|supernovae]].  As stars begin to fuse heavier elements, substantially less energy is released from each fusion reaction. Reactions that produce elements heavier than iron are [[Endothermic process|endothermic]]  and unable to generate the energy required to maintain stable fusion inside the star.\n\nOne type of natural transmutation observable in the present occurs when certain [[radioactive]] elements present in nature spontaneously decay by a process that causes transmutation, such as [[alpha decay|alpha]] or [[beta decay]]. An example is the natural decay of [[potassium-40]] to [[argon-40]], which forms most of the [[argon]] in the air. Also on Earth, natural transmutations from the different mechanisms of ''natural [[nuclear reaction]]s'' occur, due to [[cosmic ray]] bombardment of elements (for example, to form [[carbon-14]]), and also occasionally from natural neutron bombardment (for example, see [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]).\n\nArtificial transmutation may occur in machinery that has enough energy to cause changes in the nuclear structure of the elements. Such machines include [[particle accelerator]]s and [[tokamak]] reactors. Conventional [[Nuclear fission#Fission reactors|fission power reactors]] also cause artificial transmutation, not from the power of the machine, but by exposing elements to [[neutron]]s produced by fission from an artificially produced [[nuclear chain reaction]]. For instance, when a uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons, fission takes place. This releases, on average, 3 neutrons and a large amount of energy. The released neutrons then cause fission of other uranium atoms, until all of the available uranium is exhausted. This is called a [[chain reaction]].\n\nArtificial nuclear transmutation has been considered as a possible mechanism for reducing the volume and hazard of [[radioactive waste]].<ref>http://www.oecd-nea.org/trw/ \"Transmutation of Radioactive Waste.\" Nuclear Energy Agency. Feb 3rd 2012.</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Alchemy===\nThe term ''transmutation'' dates back to [[alchemy]]. Alchemists pursued the [[philosopher's stone]], capable of [[chrysopoeia]] &ndash; the transformation of [[base metal]]s into gold.<ref>{{citation |contribution=Alchemy |contribution-url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alchemy |title=Dictionary.com}}</ref> While alchemists often understood chrysopoeia as a metaphor for a mystical, or religious process, some practitioners adopted a literal interpretation, and tried to make gold through physical experiment. The impossibility of the metallic transmutation had been debated amongst alchemists, philosophers and scientists since the Middle Ages. Pseudo-alchemical transmutation was outlawed<ref>John Hines, II, R. F. Yeager. ''John Gower, Trilingual Poet: Language, Translation, and Tradition.'' Boydell & Brewer.  2010.  p.170</ref> and publicly mocked beginning in the fourteenth century. Alchemists like [[Michael Maier]] and [[Heinrich Khunrath]] wrote tracts exposing fraudulent claims of gold making. By the 1720s, there were no longer any respectable figures pursuing the physical transmutation of substances into gold.<ref>Lawrence Principe. ''New Narratives in Eighteenth-Century Chemistry''. Springer. 2007. p.8</ref> [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in the 18th century, replaced the [[Classical element#Elements in Medieval alchemy|alchemical theory of elements]] with the modern theory of chemical elements, and [[John Dalton]] further developed the notion of atoms (from the alchemical theory of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]]) to explain various chemical processes. The disintegration of atoms is a distinct process involving much greater energies than could be achieved by alchemists.\n\n===Modern physics===\nIt was first consciously applied to modern physics by [[Frederick Soddy]] when he, along with [[Ernest Rutherford]], discovered that radioactive [[thorium]] was converting itself into [[radium]] in 1901. At the moment of realization, Soddy later recalled, he shouted out: \"Rutherford, this is transmutation!\" Rutherford snapped back, \"For Christ's sake, Soddy, don't call it ''transmutation''. They'll have our heads off as alchemists.\"<ref>Muriel Howorth, ''Pioneer Research on the Atom: The Life Story of Frederick Soddy'', New World, London 1958, pp 83-84; Lawrence Badash, Radium, ''Radioactivity and the Popularity of Scientific Discovery'', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 122,1978: 145-54; Thaddeus J. Trenn, ''The Self-Splitting Atom: The History of the Rutherford-Soddy Collaboration'', Taylor & Francis, London, 1977, pp 42, 58-60, 111-17.</ref>\n\nRutherford and Soddy were observing natural transmutation as a part of [[radioactive decay]] of the [[alpha decay]] type. The first artificial transmutation was accomplished in 1925 by [[Patrick Blackett]], a research fellow working under Rutherford, with the transmutation of nitrogen into [[Oxygen-17|oxygen]], using alpha particles directed at nitrogen <sup>14</sup>N + \u03b1 \u2192 [[Oxygen-17|<sup>17</sup>O]] + p.&nbsp; <ref> http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/rutherford/sections/atop-physics-wave.html</ref> Rutherford had shown in 1919 that a proton (he called it a hydrogen atom) was emitted from alpha bombardment experiments but he had no information about the residual nucleus. Blackett's 1921-1924 experiments provided the first experimental evidence of an artificial nuclear transmutation reaction. Blackett correctly identified the underlying integration process and the identity of the residual nucleus. In 1932, a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherford's colleagues [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7 to split the nucleus into two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom,\" although it was not the modern [[nuclear fission]] reaction discovered in 1938 by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]] and their assistant Fritz Strassmann in heavy elements.<ref>[http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm Cockcroft and Walton split lithium with high energy protons April 1932. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902195556/http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm |date=2012-09-02 }}</ref>\n\nLater in the twentieth century the transmutation of elements within stars was elaborated, accounting for the relative abundance of heavier elements in the universe. Save for the first five elements, which were produced in the Big Bang and other [[cosmic ray]] processes, stellar nucleosynthesis accounted for the abundance of all elements heavier than [[boron]]. In their 1957 paper ''[[Synthesis of the Elements in Stars]]'',<ref>William Alfred Fowler, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, and Fred Hoyle, 'Synthesis of the Elements in Stars', ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', vol. 29, Issue 4, pp. 547\u2013650</ref> [[William Alfred Fowler]], [[Margaret Burbidge]], [[Geoffrey Burbidge]], and [[Fred Hoyle]] explained how the abundances of essentially all but the lightest chemical elements could be explained by the process of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars.\n\nIt transpired that, under true nuclear transmutation, it is far easier to turn gold into lead than the reverse reaction, which was the one the alchemists had ardently pursued. Nuclear experiments have successfully transmuted lead into gold, but the expense far exceeds any gain.<ref>Anne Marie Helmenstine, [http://chemistry.about.com/cs/generalchemistry/a/aa050601a.htm Turning Lead into Gold: Is Alchemy Real?], About.com:Chemistry, retrieved January 2008</ref> It would be easier to convert lead into gold via [[neutron capture]] and [[beta decay]] by leaving lead in a nuclear reactor for a long period of time.\n\n[[Glenn T.

Hydrogen and helium together account for 98% of the mass of ordinary matter in the universe, while the other 2% makes up everything else. The Big Bang also produced small amounts of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and perhaps [[boron]]. More lithium, beryllium and boron were produced later, in a natural nuclear reaction, [[cosmic ray spallation]].\n\n[[Stellar nucleosynthesis]] is responsible for all of the other elements occurring naturally in the universe as [[stable isotopes]] and [[primordial nuclide]], from [[carbon]] to [[uranium]]. These occurred after the Big Bang, during star formation. Some lighter elements from carbon to iron were formed in stars and released into space by [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) stars. These are a type of red giant that \"puffs\" off its outer atmosphere, containing some elements from carbon to nickel and iron. All elements with [[atomic weight]] greater than 64 [[atomic mass unit]]s are produced in [[supernova]] stars by means of [[neutron capture]], which sub-divides into two processes: [[r-process]] and [[s-process]].\n\nThe [[Solar System]] is thought to have condensed approximately 4.6 billion years before the present, from a cloud of hydrogen and helium containing heavier elements in dust grains formed previously by a large number of such stars. These grains contained the heavier elements formed by transmutation earlier in the history of the universe.\n\nAll of these natural processes of transmutation in stars are continuing today, in our own galaxy and in others. Stars fuse hydrogen and helium into heavier and heavier elements in order to produce energy. For example, the observed light curves of supernova stars such as [[SN 1987A]] show them blasting large amounts (comparable to the mass of Earth) of radioactive nickel and cobalt into space. However, little of this material reaches Earth. Most natural transmutation on the Earth today is mediated by [[cosmic rays]] (such as production of [[carbon-14]]) and by the radioactive decay of radioactive [[primordial nuclide]]s left over from the initial formation of the solar system (such as [[potassium-40]], uranium and thorium), plus the radioactive decay of products of these nuclides (radium, radon, polonium, etc.). See [[decay chain]].\n\n=={{Anchor|Nuclear waste}}Artificial transmutation of nuclear waste==\n\n===Overview===\nTransmutation of [[transuranium element]]s (TRUs, i.e. [[actinides]] minus [[actinium]] to [[uranium]]) such as the [[isotope]]s of [[plutonium]] (about 1wt% in the [[Light Water Reactor]]s' used [[nuclear fuel]] (UNF)) or the minor actinides (MAs, i.e. [[neptunium]], [[americium]], and [[curium]], about 0.1wt% each in LWRs' UNF) has the potential to help solve some problems posed by the management of [[radioactive waste]] by reducing the proportion of long-lived isotopes it contains. (This does not rule out the need for a [[Deep geological repository|Deep Geological Repository]] (DGR) for [[High-level waste|High radioactive Level Waste]] ([[HLW]]).) When irradiated with [[fast neutrons]] in a [[nuclear reactor]], these isotopes can  undergo [[nuclear fission]], destroying the original [[actinide]] isotope and producing a spectrum of radioactive and nonradioactive [[fission products]].\n\nCeramic targets containing actinides can be bombarded with neutrons to induce transmutation reactions to remove the most difficult long-lived species. These can consist of actinide-containing solid solutions such as (Am,Zr)N, (Am,Y)N, (Zr,Cm)O<sub>2</sub>, (Zr,Cm,Am)O<sub>2</sub>, (Zr,Am,Y)O<sub>2</sub> or just actinide phases such as AmO<sub>2</sub>, NpO<sub>2</sub>, NpN, AmN mixed with some inert phases such as MgO, MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, (Zr,Y)O<sub>2</sub>, TiN and ZrN. The role of non-radioactive inert phases is mainly to provide stable mechanical behaviour to the target under neutron irradiation.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation\n  |url=http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html\n  |publisher=Imperial College Press\n  |location=London\n  |year=2010\n  |page=198\n  |url-status=dead\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093650/http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html\n  |archive-date=9 March 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are issues with this P&T (partitioning and transmutation) strategy however:\n* first, it is limited by the costly and cumbersome need to separate LLFP isotopes before they can undergo transmutation. \n* also, some LLFPs, due to their small neutron capture cross sections, are unable to capture enough neutrons for effective transmutation to occur.\n\nThe new study led by Satoshi Chiba at Tokyo Tech (called \"Method to Reduce Long-lived Fission Products by Nuclear Transmutations with Fast Spectrum Reactors\"<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 5654822|year = 2017|last1 = Chiba|first1 = S.|title = Method to Reduce Long-lived Fission Products by Nuclear Transmutations with Fast Spectrum Reactors|journal = Scientific Reports|volume = 7|issue = 1|pages = 13961|last2 = Wakabayashi|first2 = T.|last3 = Tachi|first3 = Y.|last4 = Takaki|first4 = N.|last5 = Terashima|first5 = A.|last6 = Okumura|first6 = S.|last7 = Yoshida|first7 = T.|pmid = 29066843|doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-14319-7|bibcode = 2017NatSR...713961C}}</ref>) shows that effective transmutation of LLFPs can be achieved in fast spectrum reactors without the need for isotope separation.

As a result, [[strontium-90]] and radium are much more able to cause harm than [[caesium-137]] when a given activity is ingested. {{Citation needed span|text=Insert a brief calculation of doses |date=February 2016 |reason=Or insert a brief calculation of doses}}\n\nMany of the actinides are very radiotoxic because they have long biological half-lives and are [[alpha particle|alpha]] emitters. In transmutation the intention is to convert the actinides into [[fission products]]. The fission products are very radioactive, but the majority of the activity will decay away within a short time. The most worrying short-lived fission products are those that accumulate in the body, such as [[iodine]]-131 which accumulates in the thyroid gland, but it is hoped{{By whom|date=March 2014}} that by good design of the nuclear fuel and transmutation plant that such fission products can be isolated from humans and their environment and allowed to decay. In the medium term the fission products of highest concern are strontium-90 and caesium-137; both have a half-life of about 30 years. The caesium-137 is responsible for the majority of the external [[gamma radiation|gamma]] dose experienced by workers in [[nuclear reprocessing]] plants<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schwenk-Ferrero|first=A.|title=German Spent Nuclear Fuel Legacy: Characteristics and High-Level Waste Management Issues|journal=Science and Technology of Nuclear Installations|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=293792|doi=10.1155/2013/293792|url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/stni/2013/293792.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> and, in 2005, to workers at the [[Chernobyl]] site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cesium-RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp157-c2.pdf|publisher=cdc.gov|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> When these medium-lived isotopes have decayed almost completely (usually after 10 half-lives) the remaining isotopes will pose a much smaller threat.\n\n===Long-lived fission products (LLFP)===\n{{Long-lived fission products}}{{Medium-lived fission products}}\n{{See also|Nuclear reprocessing#Voloxidation}}\nSome radioactive fission products can be converted into shorter-lived radioisotopes by transmutation. Transmutation of all fission products with half-life greater than one year is studied in Grenoble,<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US4721596 Method for net decrease of hazardous radioactive nuclear waste materials - US Patent 4721596 Description]</ref> with varying results.\n\n[[Sr-90]] and [[Cs-137]], with half-lives of about 30 years, are the largest radiation (including heat) emitters in used nuclear fuel on a scale of decades to ~305 years (Sn-121m is insignificant because of the low yield), and are not easily transmuted because they have low [[neutron absorption]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]]s. Instead, they should simply be stored until they decay. Given that this length of storage is necessary, the fission products with shorter half-lives can also be stored until they decay.\n\nThe next longer-lived fission product is [[Sm-151]], which has a half-life of 90 years, and is such a good neutron absorber that most of it is transmuted while the nuclear fuel is still being used; however, effectively transmuting the remaining Sm-151 in nuclear waste would require separation from other isotopes of [[samarium]]. Given the smaller quantities and its low-energy radioactivity, Sm-151 is less dangerous than Sr-90 and Cs-137 and can also be left to decay for ~970 years.\n\nFinally, there are 7 [[long-lived fission product]]s. They have much longer half-lives in the range 211,000 years to 15.7 million years. Two of them, [[Tc-99]] and [[Iodine-129|I-129]], are mobile enough in the environment to be potential dangers, are free or mostly free of mixture with stable isotopes of the same element, and have neutron cross sections that are small but adequate to support transmutation.\nAlso, Tc-99 can substitute for [[Uranium-238|U-238]] in supplying [[Doppler broadening]] for negative feedback for reactor stability.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10180577-PCAEyE/10180577.PDF Transmutation of Selected Fission Products in a Fast Reactor]</ref>\nMost studies of proposed transmutation schemes have assumed [[technetium|<sup>99</sup>Tc]], [[Iodine-129|<sup>129</sup>I]], and TRUs as the targets for transmutation, with other fission products, [[activation products]], and possibly [[reprocessed uranium]] remaining as waste.<ref>[http://www.ieer.org/reports/transm/report.pdf The Nuclear Alchemy Gamble - Institute for Energy and Environmental Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOf the remaining 5 long-lived fission products, [[Se-79]], [[Sn-126]] and [[Pd-107]] are produced only in small quantities (at least in today's [[thermal neutron]], [[Uranium-235|U-235]]-burning [[light water reactors]]) and the last two should be relatively inert. The other two, [[Zr-93]] and [[Cs-135]], are produced in larger quantities, but also not highly mobile in the environment. They are also mixed with larger quantities of other isotopes of the same element.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Neutron activation]]\n*[[Nuclear power]]\n*[[List of nuclear waste treatment technologies]]\n*[[Synthesis of precious metals]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* \"Radioactive change\", Rutherford & Soddy article (1903), online and analyzed on ''[http://www.bibnum.education.fr/physique/radioactivite/la-transformation-radioactive Bibnum]'' <small>[click '\u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger' for English version]</small>.\n\n{{Nuclear technology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nuclear Transmutation}}\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear chemistry]]\n[[Category:Radioactivity]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toHLW(link removed) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation"}

A subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]], it is the [[Asia|Asian]] service of [[CNBC]] ('''C'''onsumer '''N'''ews and '''B'''usiness '''C'''hannel). Its programmes originate from [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Sydney]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\n===1995\u20131997: pre-ABN merger===\nCNBC Asia was launched on 20 June 1995 along with sister channel NBC Asia.  It was originally based in Hong Kong.  Anchors such as [[Rico Hizon]], [[Bernard Lo]], Lorraine Hahn, Sumire  Sugimoto, Dalton Tanonaka and Bill Hartley were part of the original CNBC Asia team.  It adopted similar programmes from its [[CNBC|US counterpart]] like ''[[The Money Wheel]]'' and ''Business Tonight'' and had a few of its own programmes as well.  In addition, the channel has broadcast programmes from CNBC US and [[CNBC Europe]] on a live and repeat basis.\n\n===Post-ABN merger===\nIn December 1997, [[Dow Jones & Company]] and [[NBC]] announced the merger of their international business news channels. This resulted in a merger of CNBC Asia with Dow Jones' [[Asia Business News]] (ABN), and likewise of [[CNBC Europe]] with [[European Business News]].  The merged channel launched on 1 February 1998 and was named ''CNBC Asia Business News'' but it was simply referred to as ''CNBC Asia'' in mid-1998.  As a result of the merger, there were massive employee lay-offs and programme cancellations at CNBC's Asia original headquarters in Hong Kong but Rico Hizon, Geoff Cutmore and Bernard Lo joined the newly merged channel whose operations have been based in Singapore ever since.  Programmes and personalities came mostly from ABN and were for the most part retained in their original form (i.e., title and graphics scheme).  CNBC Asia also mainly used ABN's own graphics scheme rather than adopt those in use by CNBC US and CNBC Europe.  In addition, there was no regional ticker for most audiences until 26 October 1998 and simulcasts of US and European programmes were very limited.\n\nFrom then (until January 2006) the international CNBC services carried the tagline \"A Service of NBC (Universal) and Dow Jones\" (or depending on other local partners, a variation of this tagline) when introducing regional programmes (including magazine programmes) and airing general channel promotions.\n\n===Mid-1998\u20132002===\nOn 1 June 1998, CNBC Asia added ''CNBC Sports'' which it aired weekend afternoons and in October 1998, it also started airing selected episodes of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on weekend evenings as CNBC Asia was replaced by the [[National Geographic Channel Asia|National Geographic Channel]].  When CNBC Asia launched its regional ticker in 1998, it introduced new shows such as ''Lunch Money'' (later replaced by ''Power Lunch Asia'' in 1999) and ''Market Watch'' (later renamed ''Global Market Watch'') where the latter was produced by CNBC Europe but anchored from both London and Singapore.  In addition, the channel substantially increased CNBC Europe programming in the afternoon by airing ''Europe Today'' in its entirety.\n\nIn October 1999, CNBC Asia had a partnership with the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' to present ''The Australian Financial Review Market Wrap'', a daily round-up of market news from the Australian region hosted by James Walker and Grace Phan.\n\nMajor programming changes occurred on 30 October 2000 with CNBC Asia expanding ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' to two hours, ''Asia Market Watch'' to two hours in the morning and 1\u00bd hours in the afternoon and ''Power Lunch Asia'' to one full hour.  CNBC Asia's ticker was also reformatted on that day to include colours reflecting change in the stock prices (green for an increase and red for a decrease) and a stock's ticker symbol.\n\nIn 2001, CNBC Asia introduced localised tickers to audiences in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore and has since kept the ticker on the screen during commercial breaks.\n\nIn July 2001, ''Asia Squawk Box'' was further extended to three hours and more programming hours from CNBC US and CNBC Europe were added to the line-up.  This was further extended in 2002 when US programming started at 20.00 SIN time uninterrupted on weeknights.\n\n===2006: full control by NBC Universal===\nIn July 2005, it was announced that NBC Universal would take full control of CNBC Asia from 31 December 2005, subject to clearance.  The channel's main sequences reverted from \"CNBC Asia - A Service of NBC Universal and Dow Jones\" to simply \"CNBC Asia\" on 1 January 2006.  But, on 30 October 2006, to further distinguish itself between its other counterparts, \"CNBC Asia\" simply rebranded itself as \"CNBC\", and adopting CNBC's new general slogan, \"First in Business Worldwide\".\n\n===2007 programming revamp===\nDuring the week of 19 March 2007, CNBC Asia commenced promotions for ''[[Squawk Australia]]'', hosted by James, which debuted on 26 March 2007 from a studio in Sydney.  It aired from 9.00 Sydney time/6.00 SIN/HK time weekdays.  A revamped ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'', anchored by [[Amanda Drury]] and [[Martin Soong]], followed at 7.00 SIN/HK time weekdays.\n\nCNBC also launched two brand new shows that replaced ''Market Watch'' and the [[CNBC Europe]] programme ''[[Today's Business]]''.  ''[[CNBC's Cash Flow]]'', anchored by [[Maura Fogarty]] (first hour) and Amanda Drury (second hour), was originally intensely trader and investor based.  Following on from the success of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'', another joint production, ''[[Capital Connection (TV series)|Capital Connection]]'' was launched.  It was originally anchored by Maura Fogarty in Singapore, and Steve Sedgwick in [[London]].  Unlike ''Worldwide Exchange'', which was originally produced by CNBC Europe (until production of that show was relocated to CNBC US on 4 January 2016), ''Capital Connection'' is produced by CNBC Asia.\n\nOn 27 September 2007, CNBC Asia announced strategic initiatives to push into the Australian market. Two new shows were introduced to the network: ''[[Trading Matters]]'', a wrap-up of the day's market action, and ''[[Australia This Week]]'', a concise show summarizing the week's highlights. Both shows are anchored by then-newly appointed CNBC anchor Oriel Morrison, formerly of [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] and [[Bloomberg Television]]. The shows debuted on 2 and 6 October 2007 respectively at 17.30 Sydney time/15.30 SIN time as the channel moved its Sydney bureau into a new studio situated across from the [[Australian Securities Exchange|Australian Stock Exchange]] building. The move has also seen CNBC Australia re-introduce opt-outs from the pan-Asian feed for additional airings of ''Trading Matters'' and ''Australia This Week''.\n\n===2007: return to Sydney===\nIt was announced on 5 March 2007 that CNBC Asia would be opening a bureau in [[Sydney]] to track the Australian markets.  This was in light of the recent global market correction.  ''Squawk Box'' has had reports from [[Jeffrey James]] (a former Business Presenter with Deutsche Welle DW-TV) who was also the original anchor of ''Squawk Australia''.  James was the first on-camera presence from CNBC since Mark Laudi returned to [[Singapore]] from Sydney.  James anchored Squawk Australia from a temporary location on the 11th floor of Sydney's General Electric headquarters (NAB House) from early 2007 whilst a new studio was being constructed in nearby Bridge Street.  He left the show in October 2008.  In 2007, [[Oriel Morrison]] also joined the Sydney bureau to give reports during the afternoon session there.  She anchored a 30-minute afternoon show for CNBC called ''Trading Matters''.\n\nOn 7 January 2008, [[Foxtel]] spun off a business channel from [[Sky News Australia]] called [[Sky News Business Channel]] (named after [[Fox Business Network]] in the United States).\n\nIn August 2008, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Channel Nine's finance reporter [[Karen Tso]], will be joining the network in October 2008.  She became the network's Sydney-based correspondent and anchored ''Squawk Australia'', thus replacing Jeffrey James.\n\nIn mid-2009, CNBC launched a new personal finance show, ''The Barefoot Investor'', with Australian personal finance expert Scott Pape. This is similar to ''The Suze Orman Show'' and is seen on the Australian feed during weekends.\n\n===2010: new studio new look===\nOn 14 June 2010, CNBC Asia moved to a new studio inside the [[Singapore Exchange]].  The new studio features a rear projection wall that principally gives an overview of regional market action (very similar to what CNBC Europe has).  The left side of the studio has three LCD screens where a reporter stands beside to feature one story or highlight per screen.  CNBC Asia also adopted the graphics package that CNBC US and CNBC Europe have been using since 2 March 2010.  CNBC also premi\u00e8red another production hub in Bahrain.  This hub is used by presenters to report on Middle East business and is one of the three locations from which ''[[Capital Connection (TV series)|Capital Connection]]'' is presented.\n\n===2014: new studio in Hong Kong and picture format change to 16:9===\nStarted from 30 March 2014 CNBC Asia changed its picture format to 16:9 as a standard broadcast format.  CNBC Europe followed suit on 31 March 2014.  Both networks debuted a then-new, updated graphics package, including new lower-thirds.  This on-air style did not carry over to CNBC US, which still had the old on-air style used from 1 March 2010 to 10 October 2014.  CNBC US also switched its own picture format to 16:9 on 13 October 2014.\n\n===2015\u2013present===\nOn 9 February 2015, CNBC Asia once again updated its graphics package, this time with new titles and new theme music that was based on the US version used since 13 October 2014.  Exactly a month later (9 March 2015), its sister network in [[CNBC Europe|Europe]] followed suit.  This new on-air style, which is designed by Magoo 3D Studios, matched its US counterpart.  Except for ''Asia Squawk Box'' and ''Capital Connection'', all of the programmes share the same theme music, which is different from US and Europe versions (each of their programmes have their individual music). CNBC also was added to [[Dialog TV]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\nOn 29 October 2018, ''Street Signs'' was expanded to three hours due to the cancellation of ''The Rundown'', which also resulted in ''Asia Squawk Box'' returning to the previous 6-9am SIN/HK timeslot.\n\n==Programming==\n{{Update|date=July 2010}}\n\n===2014 programming revamp===\nDuring the week of 31 March 2014, CNBC launched two brand new shows that replaced ''The Call'' and ''Cash Flow''. These were early morning show ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'' and ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' replaced ''Cash Flow''. CNBC also unveiled a redesigned studio in Hong Kong for ''Squawk Box''. CNBC also premiered another production hub in Beijing.\n\n===Weekday line-up===\nCNBC Asia produces live business day programming from 6 am to 1 pm [[UTC+08:00|SIN/HK]] time during DST or 6 am to 2 pm without DST (also SIN/HK time). The channel's weekday business day programmes (pan-Asian feed) are<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101529450|title=CNBC to Introduce New Programming Line-up in Asia|work=CNBC|date=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n* ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' \u2013 [[Sri Jegarajah]] and [[Martin Soong]] \n* ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' \u2013 [[Tanvir Gill]] and [[Nancy Hungerford]]\n* ''[[Capital Connection (TV series)|Capital Connection]]'' \u2013 Matthew Taylor and [[Hadley Gamble]]\n\nIn addition, CNBC Asia produces two weekly shows. These programmes are in the pan-Asian feed at 5 pm SIN/HK time (during DST) or 6 pm that same time (without DST) on the days indicated below, repeated at various times over the weekend. These are:\n* ''Inside China'' \u2013 [[Eunice Yoon]] (Friday only)\n* ''Managing Asia'' \u2013 [[Christine Tan]] (Friday only)\n\n===Weekends===\nCNBC Asia broadcasts lifestyle and sporting programmes, branded under CNBC Life, showings of CNBC US documentaries and weekly business shows such as ''Managing Asia'', ''Investing Asia'', ''Investing Edge'', ''Access: Middle East'', ''Suze Orman'', ''Inside China'' and ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]''. Back-to-back editions of ''[[The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' are shown during the evening.\n\n===End-of-year programming===\n[[File:CNBC Asia - 3GSM Asia.jpg|thumb|CNBC Asia outside broadcasting 2006]]\n\nOn trading days over the Christmas and new year period, CNBC Asia massively cuts back its regional programming, replacing it with pre-taped specials with live output restricted to a two-hour edition of ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]''.  Simulcasts of programmes originating from CNBC US and CNBC Europe remain unaffected.  Regular programming resumes immediately after the [[New Year's Day]] holiday.\n\n===Former programmes===\nAmong the shows that have been canceled are:\n\n====Weekdays====\n* ''[[Breakfast Briefing]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 31 March 2000, replaced by ''CNBC Today'' on 3 April 2000)\n* ''[[CNBC Today]]'' (3 April 2000 \u2013 15 March 2002, replaced by ''Asia Wake Up Call'' on 18 March 2002)\n* ''[[Asia Wake Up Call]]'' (18 March 2002 \u2013 28 March 2003, replaced by ''Asia Squawk Box'' on 31 March 2003)\n* ''[[Trading Day (CNBC Asia)|Trading Day]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 31 March 2000, replaced by ''Asia Market Watch'' and ''European Market Watch'' on 3 April 2000)\n* ''[[Lunch Money (CNBC Asia)|Lunch Money]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 29 October 1999, replaced by ''Power Lunch Asia'' on 1 November 1999)\n* ''[[Power Lunch Asia]]'' (1 November 1999 \u2013 28 March 2003, replaced by ''[[Meet The Press]]'' and ''[[US Business Center]]'' on 31 March 2003 after Rico Hizon's leave)\n* ''[[Asia Market Wrap]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 2 December 2005, replaced by ''[[Squawk Box Europe]]'' then ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' on 19 December 2005)\n* ''[[Asia Nightly News]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 30 June 2000, replaced by ''e'' on 3 July 2000)\n* ''[[Global Market Watch (CNBC Asia)|Global Market Watch]]'' (3 April 2000 \u2013 27 October 2000, replaced by ''Business Center'' on 30 October 2000)\n* ''[[Business Center (CNBC Asia)|Business Center]]'' (30 October 2000 \u2013 15 February 2005, replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''[[Australia Market Wrap]]'' (1 January 2001 \u2013 2 January 2004)\n* ''[[Australia Market Week]]'' (6 April 2001 \u2013 2 January 2004)\n* ''[[The Australian Financial Review Market Wrap]]'' (1 November 1999 \u2013 29 December 2000, replaced by ''Australia Market Wrap'')\n* ''[[Business Centre Australia]]'' (January 2001 \u2013 2 January 2004)\n* ''e'' (5 April 2000 \u2013 15 February 2005, replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''[[CNBC Tonight]]'' (16 February 2005 \u2013 16 December 2005, replaced by ''Worldwide Exchange'')\n* ''[[The Asian Wall Street Journal]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 15 February 2005, replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''[[Asia Market Watch]]'' (3 April 2000 \u2013 23 March 2007, replaced by ''CNBC's Cash Flow'' and ''Asia Squawk Box'' on 26 March 2007)\n* ''[[Cash Flow (CNBC Asia)|Cash Flow]]'' (originally ''CNBC's Cash Flow'', then ''Cash Flow From Australia''; 26 March 2007 \u2013 28 March 2014, replaced by ''Street Signs'')\n* ''[[The Call (CNBC)|The Call]]'' (14 June 2010 \u2013 28 March 2014)\n* ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'' (31 March 2014 \u2013 26 October 2018)\n\n====Primetime and weekends====\n* ''Generation e'' (replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''CEO Australia''\n* ''dot.commerce'' (replaced by ''e'' in April 2000)\n* ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' or ''Review On Air'' (cancelled in April 2001)\n* ''Driven'' (cancelled in 2000)\n* ''Over Asia'' (cancelled in 1999)\n* ''New Company''\n* ''Lo & Company''\n* ''Asian Working Woman'' (cancelled in April 2001)\n* ''Smart Money'' (cancelled in 2000)\n* ''Challenging Asia'' (cancelled in 2000)\n* ''Storyboard'' (cancelled 29 October 2000)\n* ''Asia This Week'' (cancelled in March 2003 after Rico Hizon's leave)\n\n===Sports coverage===\n* ''[[PGA Tour]]''\n* ''[[World Match Racing Tour]]''\n\n===Simulcasts outside the region===\nIn the US, all of CNBC Asia's daytime programmes are seen on [[CNBC World]].\n\nIn Europe, during the mid to late 2000s CNBC Europe had chosen to scale back simulcasts of CNBC Asia programming overnight in favour of teleshopping and later poker games and CNBC Asia's entire morning line-up had only been seen on Monday mornings. During the rest of the week, only the second hour of ''Street Signs'' and ''Capital Connection'' were seen on [[CNBC Europe]]. However, in 2009, CNBC Europe began showing almost the entire CNBC Asia schedule throughout the week.\n\nSince 23 April 2007, a free live and commercial-free stream of CNBC Asia has been available on CNBC.com every Monday, from 6AM to 4PM SIN/HK/TWN time (Sundays 6PM to 4AM ET with [[Daylight saving time|DST]]).<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/id/18204100 CNBC.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201651/http://www.cnbc.com/id/18204100 |date=2007-09-30 }} / [http://nbcumv.com/cnbc/release_detail.nbc/cnbc-20070419000000-gettheedgeonwall.html?rss=1 NBC Universal Media Village]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} : Get the Edge on Wall Street: Live Coverage of the Opening of the Asian Markets on CNBC.com. 19 April 2007.</ref>  At other times, the stream can be accessed by subscribing to CNBC Plus, which costs $9.95/month or $99.95/year.\n\nSince 4 January 2016, ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' is not shown on Fridays due to clashing with weekend shows (''Inside China'', ''The Edge'') and ''Managing Asia''.\n\n==CNBC Asia ticker==\nDuring the trading day, CNBC Asia runs a [[CNBC Ticker|ticker]] providing information from major Asian stock exchanges, as well as US and Europe recaps.  The top bar usually features the Most Active shares in the region while the bottom bar gives the latest data on indices, currencies, commodities and the treasury market.  At night, the old CNBC US ticker is simulated where only the ticker symbols are displayed instead of the companies' full names.  The ticker is shown continuously during commercial breaks and most of the data for the Asian ticker is supplied by [[Reuters]].\n\nViewers in Singapore and Australia are treated to a more localised ticker with the top bar featuring trades from their respective local stock markets exclusively.\n\nOutside Asia, the ticker can be seen alongside CNBC Asia programmes simulcasted on [[CNBC Europe]] and [[CNBC World]].  However, the ticker is not available on CNBC Asia's live stream at CNBC.com (both freeview and CNBC Plus) and is instead replaced by a similar looking static strip which says \"CNBC\" on the top bar and its tagline \"First in Business Worldwide\" on the lower bar.\n\n==Notable on-air staff==\n<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/asia-anchors/ CNBC Asia - anchors and reporters]</ref>\n\nStaff are based in Singapore unless stated otherwise.\n\n===Current===\n* [[Amanda Drury]] ([[Sydney]])\n* [[Tanvir Gill]]\n* [[Nancy Hungerford]]\n* [[Sri Jegarajah]] \n* [[Chery Kang]] \u2013 [[Hong Kong]] correspondent\n* [[Arjun Kharpal]] (China) \u2013 tech reporter\n* [[Will Koulouris]] (Sydney) \u2013 [[Australia]] correspondent\n* [[Martin Soong]]\n* [[Emily Tan]] (Hong Kong) \n* [[Christine Tan]]\n* Matthew Taylor\n* [[Eunice Yoon]] ([[Beijing]]) \u2013 [[China]] correspondent\n\n===Former===\n\n====Anchors/presenters====\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Andrea Catherwood]]\n* [[Rico Hizon]] (now with [[BBC World News]])\n* [[Fauziah Ibrahim]] (now with [[ABC News (Australia)]])\n* [[Jeffrey James]] (now based in China)\n* [[May Lee]] (her \"Oprah\"-style talk show on STAR World premiered in May 2008)\n* [[Susan Li]] (moved to [[CNBC Europe]] and later to [[CNBC|CNBC US]]; left in August 2017, now with [[Fox Business]])\n* [[Teymoor Nabili]] (formerly with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], now with [[Channel NewsAsia]])\n* [[Dalton Tanonaka]] (now with [[Metro TV (Indonesia)|Metro TV]])\n* [[Karen Tso]] (now based at [[CNBC Europe]] as co-anchor of ''[[Squawk Box Europe]]'')\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n====Correspondents====\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Geoff Cutmore]] (now with CNBC Europe, hosting ''[[Squawk Box Europe]]'')\n* [[Betty Liu]] (now with Bloomberg Television, [[New York City|New York]] studios)\n* [[Colette Wong]] (now with [[Fox Sports Asia]] and [[Fox Sports News (Asia)|Fox Sports News Asia]])\n* [[Tracey Chang]] (now with [[China Central Television|CCTV]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Other CNBC Asia Services and partnerships==\n\n===CNBC-based channels===\nIn conjunction with local partners it provides the following local channels:\n* [[CNBC TV18]] (in India, formerly CNBC India)\n* [[CNBC|CNBC Infinitey]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC Awaaz]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC Bajar]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC|CNBC Prime]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC|CNBC Tamilin]] (in India)\n* [[Nikkei CNBC]] (in Japan)\n* [[CNBC Pakistan]] (now closed)\n* [[SBS-CNBC]] (in Korea)\n* [[CNBC Indonesia]] (in Indonesia)\n* [[JKN-CNBC]] (in Thailand)\n\n===Other TV and print partners===\n* [[Seoul Broadcasting System]] (SBS) (in [[South Korea]])\n** Formerly MBN CNBC was also provided in Korea.

A subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]], it is the [[Asia|Asian]] service of [[CNBC]] ('''C'''onsumer '''N'''ews and '''B'''usiness '''C'''hannel). Its programmes originate from [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Sydney]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\n===1995\u20131997: pre-ABN merger===\nCNBC Asia was launched on 20 June 1995 along with sister channel NBC Asia.  It was originally based in Hong Kong.  Anchors such as [[Rico Hizon]], [[Bernard Lo]], Lorraine Hahn, Sumire  Sugimoto, Dalton Tanonaka and Bill Hartley were part of the original CNBC Asia team.  It adopted similar programmes from its [[CNBC|US counterpart]] like ''[[The Money Wheel]]'' and ''Business Tonight'' and had a few of its own programmes as well.  In addition, the channel has broadcast programmes from CNBC US and [[CNBC Europe]] on a live and repeat basis.\n\n===Post-ABN merger===\nIn December 1997, [[Dow Jones & Company]] and [[NBC]] announced the merger of their international business news channels. This resulted in a merger of CNBC Asia with Dow Jones' [[Asia Business News]] (ABN), and likewise of [[CNBC Europe]] with [[European Business News]].  The merged channel launched on 1 February 1998 and was named ''CNBC Asia Business News'' but it was simply referred to as ''CNBC Asia'' in mid-1998.  As a result of the merger, there were massive employee lay-offs and programme cancellations at CNBC's Asia original headquarters in Hong Kong but Rico Hizon, Geoff Cutmore and Bernard Lo joined the newly merged channel whose operations have been based in Singapore ever since.  Programmes and personalities came mostly from ABN and were for the most part retained in their original form (i.e., title and graphics scheme).  CNBC Asia also mainly used ABN's own graphics scheme rather than adopt those in use by CNBC US and CNBC Europe.  In addition, there was no regional ticker for most audiences until 26 October 1998 and simulcasts of US and European programmes were very limited.\n\nFrom then (until January 2006) the international CNBC services carried the tagline \"A Service of NBC (Universal) and Dow Jones\" (or depending on other local partners, a variation of this tagline) when introducing regional programmes (including magazine programmes) and airing general channel promotions.\n\n===Mid-1998\u20132002===\nOn 1 June 1998, CNBC Asia added ''CNBC Sports'' which it aired weekend afternoons and in October 1998, it also started airing selected episodes of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on weekend evenings as CNBC Asia was replaced by the [[National Geographic Channel Asia|National Geographic Channel]].  When CNBC Asia launched its regional ticker in 1998, it introduced new shows such as ''Lunch Money'' (later replaced by ''Power Lunch Asia'' in 1999) and ''Market Watch'' (later renamed ''Global Market Watch'') where the latter was produced by CNBC Europe but anchored from both London and Singapore.  In addition, the channel substantially increased CNBC Europe programming in the afternoon by airing ''Europe Today'' in its entirety.\n\nIn October 1999, CNBC Asia had a partnership with the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' to present ''The Australian Financial Review Market Wrap'', a daily round-up of market news from the Australian region hosted by James Walker and Grace Phan.\n\nMajor programming changes occurred on 30 October 2000 with CNBC Asia expanding ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' to two hours, ''Asia Market Watch'' to two hours in the morning and 1\u00bd hours in the afternoon and ''Power Lunch Asia'' to one full hour.  CNBC Asia's ticker was also reformatted on that day to include colours reflecting change in the stock prices (green for an increase and red for a decrease) and a stock's ticker symbol.\n\nIn 2001, CNBC Asia introduced localised tickers to audiences in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore and has since kept the ticker on the screen during commercial breaks.\n\nIn July 2001, ''Asia Squawk Box'' was further extended to three hours and more programming hours from CNBC US and CNBC Europe were added to the line-up.  This was further extended in 2002 when US programming started at 20.00 SIN time uninterrupted on weeknights.\n\n===2006: full control by NBC Universal===\nIn July 2005, it was announced that NBC Universal would take full control of CNBC Asia from 31 December 2005, subject to clearance.  The channel's main sequences reverted from \"CNBC Asia - A Service of NBC Universal and Dow Jones\" to simply \"CNBC Asia\" on 1 January 2006.  But, on 30 October 2006, to further distinguish itself between its other counterparts, \"CNBC Asia\" simply rebranded itself as \"CNBC\", and adopting CNBC's new general slogan, \"First in Business Worldwide\".\n\n===2007 programming revamp===\nDuring the week of 19 March 2007, CNBC Asia commenced promotions for ''[[Squawk Australia]]'', hosted by James, which debuted on 26 March 2007 from a studio in Sydney.  It aired from 9.00 Sydney time/6.00 SIN/HK time weekdays.  A revamped ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'', anchored by [[Amanda Drury]] and [[Martin Soong]], followed at 7.00 SIN/HK time weekdays.\n\nCNBC also launched two brand new shows that replaced ''Market Watch'' and the [[CNBC Europe]] programme ''[[Today's Business]]''.  ''[[CNBC's Cash Flow]]'', anchored by [[Maura Fogarty]] (first hour) and Amanda Drury (second hour), was originally intensely trader and investor based.  Following on from the success of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'', another joint production, ''[[Capital Connection (TV series)|Capital Connection]]'' was launched.  It was originally anchored by Maura Fogarty in Singapore, and Steve Sedgwick in [[London]].  Unlike ''Worldwide Exchange'', which was originally produced by CNBC Europe (until production of that show was relocated to CNBC US on 4 January 2016), ''Capital Connection'' is produced by CNBC Asia.\n\nOn 27 September 2007, CNBC Asia announced strategic initiatives to push into the Australian market. Two new shows were introduced to the network: ''[[Trading Matters]]'', a wrap-up of the day's market action, and ''[[Australia This Week]]'', a concise show summarizing the week's highlights. Both shows are anchored by then-newly appointed CNBC anchor Oriel Morrison, formerly of [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] and [[Bloomberg Television]]. The shows debuted on 2 and 6 October 2007 respectively at 17.30 Sydney time/15.30 SIN time as the channel moved its Sydney bureau into a new studio situated across from the [[Australian Securities Exchange|Australian Stock Exchange]] building. The move has also seen CNBC Australia re-introduce opt-outs from the pan-Asian feed for additional airings of ''Trading Matters'' and ''Australia This Week''.\n\n===2007: return to Sydney===\nIt was announced on 5 March 2007 that CNBC Asia would be opening a bureau in [[Sydney]] to track the Australian markets.  This was in light of the recent global market correction.  ''Squawk Box'' has had reports from [[Jeffrey James]] (a former Business Presenter with Deutsche Welle DW-TV) who was also the original anchor of ''Squawk Australia''.  James was the first on-camera presence from CNBC since Mark Laudi returned to [[Singapore]] from Sydney.  James anchored Squawk Australia from a temporary location on the 11th floor of Sydney's General Electric headquarters (NAB House) from early 2007 whilst a new studio was being constructed in nearby Bridge Street.  He left the show in October 2008.  In 2007, [[Oriel Morrison]] also joined the Sydney bureau to give reports during the afternoon session there.  She anchored a 30-minute afternoon show for CNBC called ''Trading Matters''.\n\nOn 7 January 2008, [[Foxtel]] spun off a business channel from [[Sky News Australia]] called [[Sky News Business Channel]] (named after [[Fox Business Network]] in the United States).\n\nIn August 2008, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Channel Nine's finance reporter [[Karen Tso]], will be joining the network in October 2008.  She became the network's Sydney-based correspondent and anchored ''Squawk Australia'', thus replacing Jeffrey James.\n\nIn mid-2009, CNBC launched a new personal finance show, ''The Barefoot Investor'', with Australian personal finance expert Scott Pape. This is similar to ''The Suze Orman Show'' and is seen on the Australian feed during weekends.\n\n===2010: new studio new look===\nOn 14 June 2010, CNBC Asia moved to a new studio inside the [[Singapore Exchange]].  The new studio features a rear projection wall that principally gives an overview of regional market action (very similar to what CNBC Europe has).  The left side of the studio has three LCD screens where a reporter stands beside to feature one story or highlight per screen.  CNBC Asia also adopted the graphics package that CNBC US and CNBC Europe have been using since 2 March 2010.  CNBC also premi\u00e8red another production hub in Bahrain.  This hub is used by presenters to report on Middle East business and is one of the three locations from which ''[[Capital Connection (TV series)|Capital Connection]]'' is presented.\n\n===2014: new studio in Hong Kong and picture format change to 16:9===\nStarted from 30 March 2014 CNBC Asia changed its picture format to 16:9 as a standard broadcast format.  CNBC Europe followed suit on 31 March 2014.  Both networks debuted a then-new, updated graphics package, including new lower-thirds.  This on-air style did not carry over to CNBC US, which still had the old on-air style used from 1 March 2010 to 10 October 2014.  CNBC US also switched its own picture format to 16:9 on 13 October 2014.\n\n===2015\u2013present===\nOn 9 February 2015, CNBC Asia once again updated its graphics package, this time with new titles and new theme music that was based on the US version used since 13 October 2014.  Exactly a month later (9 March 2015), its sister network in [[CNBC Europe|Europe]] followed suit.  This new on-air style, which is designed by Magoo 3D Studios, matched its US counterpart.  Except for ''Asia Squawk Box'' and ''Capital Connection'', all of the programmes share the same theme music, which is different from US and Europe versions (each of their programmes have their individual music). CNBC also was added to [[Dialog TV]] in [[Sri Lanka]].\n\nOn 29 October 2018, ''Street Signs'' was expanded to three hours due to the cancellation of ''The Rundown'', which also resulted in ''Asia Squawk Box'' returning to the previous 6-9am SIN/HK timeslot.\n\n==Programming==\n{{Update|date=July 2010}}\n\n===2014 programming revamp===\nDuring the week of 31 March 2014, CNBC launched two brand new shows that replaced ''The Call'' and ''Cash Flow''. These were early morning show ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'' and ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' replaced ''Cash Flow''. CNBC also unveiled a redesigned studio in Hong Kong for ''Squawk Box''. CNBC also premiered another production hub in Beijing.\n\n===Weekday line-up===\nCNBC Asia produces live business day programming from 6 am to 1 pm [[UTC+08:00|SIN/HK]] time during DST or 6 am to 2 pm without DST (also SIN/HK time). The channel's weekday business day programmes (pan-Asian feed) are<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101529450|title=CNBC to Introduce New Programming Line-up in Asia|work=CNBC|date=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n* ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]'' \u2013 [[Sri Jegarajah]] and [[Martin Soong]] \n* ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' \u2013 [[Tanvir Gill]] and [[Nancy Hungerford]]\n* ''[[Capital Connection (TV series)|Capital Connection]]'' \u2013 Matthew Taylor and [[Hadley Gamble]]\n\nIn addition, CNBC Asia produces two weekly shows. These programmes are in the pan-Asian feed at 5 pm SIN/HK time (during DST) or 6 pm that same time (without DST) on the days indicated below, repeated at various times over the weekend. These are:\n* ''Inside China'' \u2013 [[Eunice Yoon]] (Friday only)\n* ''Managing Asia'' \u2013 [[Christine Tan]] (Friday only)\n\n===Weekends===\nCNBC Asia broadcasts lifestyle and sporting programmes, branded under CNBC Life, showings of CNBC US documentaries and weekly business shows such as ''Managing Asia'', ''Investing Asia'', ''Investing Edge'', ''Access: Middle East'', ''Suze Orman'', ''Inside China'' and ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]''. Back-to-back editions of ''[[The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' are shown during the evening.\n\n===End-of-year programming===\n[[File:CNBC Asia - 3GSM Asia.jpg|thumb|CNBC Asia outside broadcasting 2006]]\n\nOn trading days over the Christmas and new year period, CNBC Asia massively cuts back its regional programming, replacing it with pre-taped specials with live output restricted to a two-hour edition of ''[[Asia Squawk Box]]''.  Simulcasts of programmes originating from CNBC US and CNBC Europe remain unaffected.  Regular programming resumes immediately after the [[New Year's Day]] holiday.\n\n===Former programmes===\nAmong the shows that have been canceled are:\n\n====Weekdays====\n* ''[[Breakfast Briefing]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 31 March 2000, replaced by ''CNBC Today'' on 3 April 2000)\n* ''[[CNBC Today]]'' (3 April 2000 \u2013 15 March 2002, replaced by ''Asia Wake Up Call'' on 18 March 2002)\n* ''[[Asia Wake Up Call]]'' (18 March 2002 \u2013 28 March 2003, replaced by ''Asia Squawk Box'' on 31 March 2003)\n* ''[[Trading Day (CNBC Asia)|Trading Day]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 31 March 2000, replaced by ''Asia Market Watch'' and ''European Market Watch'' on 3 April 2000)\n* ''[[Lunch Money (CNBC Asia)|Lunch Money]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 29 October 1999, replaced by ''Power Lunch Asia'' on 1 November 1999)\n* ''[[Power Lunch Asia]]'' (1 November 1999 \u2013 28 March 2003, replaced by ''[[Meet The Press]]'' and ''[[US Business Center]]'' on 31 March 2003 after Rico Hizon's leave)\n* ''[[Asia Market Wrap]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 2 December 2005, replaced by ''[[Squawk Box Europe]]'' then ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' on 19 December 2005)\n* ''[[Asia Nightly News]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 30 June 2000, replaced by ''e'' on 3 July 2000)\n* ''[[Global Market Watch (CNBC Asia)|Global Market Watch]]'' (3 April 2000 \u2013 27 October 2000, replaced by ''Business Center'' on 30 October 2000)\n* ''[[Business Center (CNBC Asia)|Business Center]]'' (30 October 2000 \u2013 15 February 2005, replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''[[Australia Market Wrap]]'' (1 January 2001 \u2013 2 January 2004)\n* ''[[Australia Market Week]]'' (6 April 2001 \u2013 2 January 2004)\n* ''[[The Australian Financial Review Market Wrap]]'' (1 November 1999 \u2013 29 December 2000, replaced by ''Australia Market Wrap'')\n* ''[[Business Centre Australia]]'' (January 2001 \u2013 2 January 2004)\n* ''e'' (5 April 2000 \u2013 15 February 2005, replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''[[CNBC Tonight]]'' (16 February 2005 \u2013 16 December 2005, replaced by ''Worldwide Exchange'')\n* ''[[The Asian Wall Street Journal]]'' (2 February 1998 \u2013 15 February 2005, replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''[[Asia Market Watch]]'' (3 April 2000 \u2013 23 March 2007, replaced by ''CNBC's Cash Flow'' and ''Asia Squawk Box'' on 26 March 2007)\n* ''[[Cash Flow (CNBC Asia)|Cash Flow]]'' (originally ''CNBC's Cash Flow'', then ''Cash Flow From Australia''; 26 March 2007 \u2013 28 March 2014, replaced by ''Street Signs'')\n* ''[[The Call (CNBC)|The Call]]'' (14 June 2010 \u2013 28 March 2014)\n* ''[[The Rundown (CNBC Asia)|The Rundown]]'' (31 March 2014 \u2013 26 October 2018)\n\n====Primetime and weekends====\n* ''Generation e'' (replaced by ''CNBC Tonight'')\n* ''CEO Australia''\n* ''dot.commerce'' (replaced by ''e'' in April 2000)\n* ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' or ''Review On Air'' (cancelled in April 2001)\n* ''Driven'' (cancelled in 2000)\n* ''Over Asia'' (cancelled in 1999)\n* ''New Company''\n* ''Lo & Company''\n* ''Asian Working Woman'' (cancelled in April 2001)\n* ''Smart Money'' (cancelled in 2000)\n* ''Challenging Asia'' (cancelled in 2000)\n* ''Storyboard'' (cancelled 29 October 2000)\n* ''Asia This Week'' (cancelled in March 2003 after Rico Hizon's leave)\n\n===Sports coverage===\n* ''[[PGA Tour]]''\n* ''[[World Match Racing Tour]]''\n\n===Simulcasts outside the region===\nIn the US, all of CNBC Asia's daytime programmes are seen on [[CNBC World]].\n\nIn Europe, during the mid to late 2000s CNBC Europe had chosen to scale back simulcasts of CNBC Asia programming overnight in favour of teleshopping and later poker games and CNBC Asia's entire morning line-up had only been seen on Monday mornings. During the rest of the week, only the second hour of ''Street Signs'' and ''Capital Connection'' were seen on [[CNBC Europe]]. However, in 2009, CNBC Europe began showing almost the entire CNBC Asia schedule throughout the week.\n\nSince 23 April 2007, a free live and commercial-free stream of CNBC Asia has been available on CNBC.com every Monday, from 6AM to 4PM SIN/HK/TWN time (Sundays 6PM to 4AM ET with [[Daylight saving time|DST]]).<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/id/18204100 CNBC.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201651/http://www.cnbc.com/id/18204100 |date=2007-09-30 }} / [http://nbcumv.com/cnbc/release_detail.nbc/cnbc-20070419000000-gettheedgeonwall.html?rss=1 NBC Universal Media Village]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} : Get the Edge on Wall Street: Live Coverage of the Opening of the Asian Markets on CNBC.com. 19 April 2007.</ref>  At other times, the stream can be accessed by subscribing to CNBC Plus, which costs $9.95/month or $99.95/year.\n\nSince 4 January 2016, ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' is not shown on Fridays due to clashing with weekend shows (''Inside China'', ''The Edge'') and ''Managing Asia''.\n\n==CNBC Asia ticker==\nDuring the trading day, CNBC Asia runs a [[CNBC Ticker|ticker]] providing information from major Asian stock exchanges, as well as US and Europe recaps.  The top bar usually features the Most Active shares in the region while the bottom bar gives the latest data on indices, currencies, commodities and the treasury market.  At night, the old CNBC US ticker is simulated where only the ticker symbols are displayed instead of the companies' full names.  The ticker is shown continuously during commercial breaks and most of the data for the Asian ticker is supplied by [[Reuters]].\n\nViewers in Singapore and Australia are treated to a more localised ticker with the top bar featuring trades from their respective local stock markets exclusively.\n\nOutside Asia, the ticker can be seen alongside CNBC Asia programmes simulcasted on [[CNBC Europe]] and [[CNBC World]].  However, the ticker is not available on CNBC Asia's live stream at CNBC.com (both freeview and CNBC Plus) and is instead replaced by a similar looking static strip which says \"CNBC\" on the top bar and its tagline \"First in Business Worldwide\" on the lower bar.\n\n==Notable on-air staff==\n<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/asia-anchors/ CNBC Asia - anchors and reporters]</ref>\n\nStaff are based in Singapore unless stated otherwise.\n\n===Current===\n* [[Amanda Drury]] ([[Sydney]])\n* [[Tanvir Gill]]\n* [[Nancy Hungerford]]\n* [[Sri Jegarajah]] \n* [[Chery Kang]] \u2013 [[Hong Kong]] correspondent\n* [[Arjun Kharpal]] (China) \u2013 tech reporter\n* [[Will Koulouris]] (Sydney) \u2013 [[Australia]] correspondent\n* [[Martin Soong]]\n* [[Emily Tan]] (Hong Kong) \n* [[Christine Tan]]\n* Matthew Taylor\n* [[Eunice Yoon]] ([[Beijing]]) \u2013 [[China]] correspondent\n\n===Former===\n\n====Anchors/presenters====\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Andrea Catherwood]]\n* [[Rico Hizon]] (now with [[BBC World News]])\n* [[Fauziah Ibrahim]] (now with [[ABC News (Australia)]])\n* [[Jeffrey James]] (now based in China)\n* [[May Lee]] (her \"Oprah\"-style talk show on STAR World premiered in May 2008)\n* [[Susan Li]] (moved to [[CNBC Europe]] and later to [[CNBC|CNBC US]]; left in August 2017, now with [[Fox Business]])\n* [[Teymoor Nabili]] (formerly with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], now with [[Channel NewsAsia]])\n* [[Dalton Tanonaka]] (now with [[Metro TV (Indonesia)|Metro TV]])\n* [[Karen Tso]] (now based at [[CNBC Europe]] as co-anchor of ''[[Squawk Box Europe]]'')\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n====Correspondents====\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Geoff Cutmore]] (now with CNBC Europe, hosting ''[[Squawk Box Europe]]'')\n* [[Betty Liu]] (now with Bloomberg Television, [[New York City|New York]] studios)\n* [[Colette Wong]] (now with [[Fox Sports Asia]] and [[Fox Sports News (Asia)|Fox Sports News Asia]])\n* [[Tracey Chang]] (now with [[China Central Television|CCTV]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Other CNBC Asia Services and partnerships==\n\n===CNBC-based channels===\nIn conjunction with local partners it provides the following local channels:\n* [[CNBC TV18]] (in India, formerly CNBC India)\n* [[CNBC|CNBC Infinitey]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC Awaaz]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC Bajar]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC|CNBC Prime]] (in India)\n* [[CNBC|CNBC Tamilin]] (in India)\n* [[Nikkei CNBC]] (in Japan)\n* [[CNBC Pakistan]] (now closed)\n* [[SBS-CNBC]] (in Korea)\n* [[CNBC Indonesia]] (in Indonesia)\n* [[JKN-CNBC]] (in Thailand)\n\n===Other TV and print partners===\n* [[Seoul Broadcasting System]] (SBS) (in [[South Korea]])\n** Formerly MBN CNBC was also provided in Korea.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\n\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine.

Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\n\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.|year=1997|title=Protocols for monitoring New Zealand robins: Petroica australis|series=Department of Conservation Technical Series|volume=13|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation}}</ref> However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.<ref name=\"ref13\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter. Fossils of New Zealand robins can sometimes be found near pit fall deposits, as they do most of their feeding/foraging on the ground.<ref name=\"ref5\">{{cite book|last1=Worthy|first1=Trevor H.|last2=Holdaway|first2=Richard N.|year=2002|chapter=Shorebirds, Parrots and Passerines|title=The Lost World of the Moa|pages=410\u2013440}}</ref> The fossil record also indicates the robins' presence throughout lowland New Zealand until drastic habitat reduction through deforestation by the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ancestors of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and later European colonisers.<ref name=\"ref6\">{{cite journal|last=Borkin|first=K.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.|year=1997|title=Protocols for monitoring New Zealand robins: Petroica australis|series=Department of Conservation Technical Series|volume=13|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation}}</ref> However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.<ref name=\"ref13\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D.

''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.
