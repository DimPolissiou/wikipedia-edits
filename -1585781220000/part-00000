He was introduced by producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]] to revamp the show, and originally served as one of the show's leading [[protagonists]] throughout the 1990s; with the character first appearing in 22 February 1990 and then departing on 25 October 1999 after Kemp had opted to leave the show in 1999. He then returned to the show on 24 October 2005 for a few weeks and returned again between March and June 2006. Kemp was persuaded to return to the role for brief stints during a period of heavy media criticism aimed at ''EastEnders''. The return proved to be a ratings success. Kemp reprised the role of Grant for various guest stints in 2016, appearing in twelve episodes between 13 May and 9 September.\n\nThroughout the course of his 1990s duration, Grant established himself as one of the show's most prominent characters. He was portrayed as a tough persona, wildly known for his fiery temper and his tendency to resort to violence. Despite this, however, his [[Mitchell family|family]] is important to him \u2013 particularly his relationship with his older brother [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Known as the \"Mitchell brothers\", Grant and Phil have become household names in the United Kingdom \u2013 due to their association with the stereotypical black [[leather jacket]] wearing bald and brutal thug. They have been parodied even in adverts where their gruff, tough talking, cockney accents have been impersonated. One of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most popular and highly rated storylines was \"[[Sharongate]]\", where Grant discovers that his wife [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) has been having an affair with his brother. In light of this iconic revelation, Grant attacked Phil and exact revenge on Sharon until she departed the programme following her betrayal. Grant then went on to embark on a second marriage with local barmaid [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), up to the point where she gave birth to their daughter \u2013 [[Courtney Mitchell|Courtney]]. However, their marriage ended in tragedy when Grant's longstanding mistreatment towards Tiffany ultimately led to her being accidentally killed by Peggy's would-be second husband [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]).\n\nThe character has also become a prime suspect in the murder of Sharon's hated boss [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), which later triggered a quarrel with her best-friend [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]); clashed with his  mother's campaign rival [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]]); sparked a number of altercations Sam's former boyfriend [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]); cheated on Tiffany by having an affair with her mother [[Louise Raymond|Louise]] ([[Carol Harrison]]); developed a feud with his archenemy [[Beppe di Marco]] ([[Michael Greco (actor)|Michael Greco]]); disputed with Beppe's younger brother [[Gianni di Marco|Gianni]] ([[Marc Bannerman]]); worked with Palmer's daughter [[Annie Palmer|Annie]] ([[Nadia Sawalha]]) on a jointed business venture at the local gym; established an antagonistic business partnership with Phil's would-be sworn nemesis, [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]); had a one-night stand with Phil's estranged wife [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]); exonerated Sam for the murder of Sharon's illegitimate father, [[Den Watts|Den]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), by proving to his ex-wife that her stepmother [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) was responsible for the crime; teamed up with Phil to confront their mother's gangland enemy, [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]), and get justice for the death of Sharon's adopted brother-turned-newly husband [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) in the [[Get Johnny Week]] scenario; infuriated Kathy's son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) by having an affair with his eventual lover [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]); ended his third ill-fated marriage to [[Carla Mitchell|Carla]] ([[Christianne Oliveira]]) upon learning that she turned him against Courtney; and discovered that he is the father of Michelle's secret son, [[Mark Fowler (2016 character)|Mark]] ([[Ned Porteous]]), in light of coping with losing his mother Peggy to cancer.\n\nDespite his tough nature, he is also a womanizer and has been involved in several relationships with an array of women - including [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]), [[Lorraine Wicks]] ([[Jacqueline Leonard]]), [[Nina Harris]] ([[Troy Titus-Adams]]), and [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]). He has calmed down in recent years, although Grant is still feared by people in and around Walford.\n\n==Storylines==\n===1990\u20131999===\nGrant Mitchell first arrived in [[Albert Square]] with his older brother [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), and the pair become co-owners of the local garage - The Arches. Grant had returned from being a [[paratrooper]] in the [[British Army|Army]] who got involved in the [[Falklands War]]. After a brief fling with [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]) and getting involved in various dodgy deals, Grant starts wooing the local barmaid - [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). She grows attracted to his machismo, and soon their flirting progresses into a relationship. Fiercely protective of his girlfriend, most of Grant's initial problems in the Square revolve around his over-possessive nature and jealousy. He puts Sharon's boss [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), the landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], in hospital after he makes a pass at Sharon; he later becomes prime suspect for Royle's murder, but is proven innocent when the killer is revealed to be [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) - a local thug who eventually owns up to the crime. In the wake of this, Grant decides to re-enlist in the army; however, he is left despondent after getting rejected for failing their psychiatric tests.\n\n[[File:Grant shax.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Grant and [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] marry (1991).]]\n\nDespite his hot-headed tendencies, Sharon sees a different side to Grant, and when he proposes marriage to her, she accepts on the condition that he buys her her childhood home, The Queen Vic, which he does. Grant marries Sharon and together they run The Queen Vic. Their marriage is stormy and punctuated with violent rows and fights. Grant is desperate for a child, and when he discovers Sharon is still taking contraception, he smashes up the pub and then disappears.  In his absence, Sharon is comforted by Phil and they begin an affair, although this comes to an abrupt end when Grant returns and promises to change his ways. He cannot live up to his promises however, and on Sharon's birthday, Grant sets fire to The Queen Vic to generate insurance money to pay off debts. He does not check to see if Sharon is out of the way, and she and her dog [[Roly]] nearly die in the blaze. The insurance money is insufficient, and Sharon reacts with fury when she discovers what Grant has done. She leaves Grant for a while, and when she returns and attempts to seize control of The Queen Vic; Grant turns violent, assaults Sharon and her best friend [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) and is imprisoned on remand. While he is in prison, Sharon and Phil rekindle their affair, but neither can confess to Grant, and it ends when he is released from prison. Sharon and Grant patch up their relationship; however, Grant discovers a tape on which Sharon talks about her affair with Phil, and plays it to a packed pub at Phil's engagement party to his fiance - [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). In response, Grant batters Phil in revenge - leaving him with a [[ruptured spleen]] - and bullies Sharon until she flees to the [[United States]]. She returns briefly to enact revenge, making Grant realise that he is still in love with her, he chooses to be with Sharon over his family. Sharon is ready to turn him down in front of a packed pub and his family. However, in the end, she cannot go through with it, and stops him from publicly proposing before he humiliates himself. She then confesses to him that she still loves him, before returning to the US, leaving Grant heartbroken.\n\nMichelle has a volatile relationship with Grant but, following Sharon's exit, falls pregnant following a [[one-night stand]] with him and then flees to the US without telling Grant that he is to be a father. Grant would not find out that the baby is his until years later. He goes on to marry [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), who soon becomes pregnant - although it is unclear whether he or Tiffany's ex-partner [[Tony Hills|Tony]] ([[Mark Homer]]) is the father of her child. When Grant discovers this, he is incensed and throws Tiffany out. He begins a relationship with [[Lorraine Wicks]] ([[Jacqueline Leonard]]), until a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity test]] reveals that Grant is the father of his baby, [[Courtney Mitchell|Courtney]] (Carissa and Josephine O'Meara). He reunites with Tiffany to be near his daughter, but by this time his marriage has deteriorated. When Tiffany discovers that Grant has had an affair with her mother [[Louise Raymond]] ([[Carol Harrison]]), she plans to flee to [[Spain]] with Courtney. However, Grant discovers her plan and retrieves Courtney. Tiffany attempts to snatch Courtney, but is hit by a car driven by Grant's stepfather [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]); she dies instantly as the clock struck midnight. Grant tries to move on by dating barmaid [[Nina Harris]] ([[Troy Titus-Adams]]) for a while, but dumps her after discovering the latter's past as a [[prostitute]] is uncovered.\n\nIt is at this point that Grant and Phil have established themselves as the undisputed hardman of the square's local borough - [[Walford]]; the pair have spent the entirely of the 1990s decade embarking on criminal activities, amongst other separate shenanigans. Despite the majority of occasions when the pair clashed, particularly in the follow-up to Phil's affair with Sharon, the two brothers remained faithful to each other. This impact heightens in 1999 when Grant goes into partnership with Phil's archenemy [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]]), and they end up having a feud - which ends with Grant punching Steve after getting annoyed with his disrespectful attitude towards him. By then, Grant and Phil have conducted a plan to cheat some gangsters by intercepting a [[Illegal drug trade|drug deal]] and stealing a large amount of cash - in order to take care of their debts. The job is initially successful, but is quickly grows obstructive when Phil finds out that Grant had slept his ex-wife Kathy before doing the job. He confronts Grant after the job and Grant admits he did it in revenge for Phil having sex with Sharon. As they attempt to flee from the oncoming police, Phil pulls out a gun and shoots the steering wheel in their getaway car - causing Grant to plunge the car into the [[River Thames]]. Phil is rescued, but Grant is not found and presumed dead. It soon transpires a week later that Grant has survived, and he leaves the country with both Courtney and the stolen money to [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n===2005\u20132006===\nGrant returns to Walford with Phil to exonerate their younger sister, [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]), for the murder of her ex-boss and Sharon's adopted father - [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]). Although she was involved in the events surrounding Den's murder, Sam was framed for the crime by his widow and her nemesis [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) - the real murderer. Grant manages to put behind him his differences with both Phil and Sharon, forgiving Sharon when she confesses that she aborted his child. The two brothers manage to convince Sharon that Chrissie is the real killer and that Sam is innocent. Whilst teaming up with Phil and Sharon to prove Sam's innocence, Grant forms a rivalry with her husband [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) - who had previously teamed up with Den to imprison Phil for robbery. Grant and Dennis soon put their differences aside to help Phil with their conflict against [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]), the local gangland kingpin who holds a grudge against the Mitchell brothers because of their mother - [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). When Johnny extracts CCTV footage of Chrissie confessing to her boyfriend [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) that she killed Den, he plans to use the tape as bait for Phil and Grant - intending to kill them. The brothers eventually beat Johnny at his nightclub office in order to get the tape, which is promptly delivered to the police; as a result, Sam is released from prison and Chrissie is arrested for Den's murder.\n\nFollowing Sam's release, Grant initially returns to Rio - only to later come back to Walford with Courtney (now played by [[Megan Jossa]]), citing family and financial problems back in Brazil. When Phil learns about his brother's return, he tricks Grant into helping him with quest against Johnny. During Grant's absence, Phil and Johnny embarked on a feud that led to Dennis and Sharon getting involved. The impact escalated after Dennis humiliated Johnny on Christmas Day 2005, which prompted Johnny to throttle Sharon with an ultimatum; Dennis will be killed unless she and him leave Walford for good. On the eve of 2006 commencing, Dennis learned from Phil about the threat Johnny made to Sharon - as well as being told that Johnny killed his best-friend and Sam's ex-husband, [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]), on the same night Chrissie killed Den. This resulted in Dennis beating up Johnny, who then ordered Jake's brother [[Danny Moon|Danny]] ([[Jake Maskall]]) - his henchman - to kill Dennis. Following Dennis' murder, Phil was wracked with guilt for sparking the events of Sharon losing her husband and has vowed revenge on Johnny more than ever. After hearing Phil explain his reasons for wanting to bring Johnny to justice for killing Dennis, specifically as a promise he made to Sharon before she left Walford, Grant reluctantly accompanies his brother in settling their score with Johnny once and for all. Their efforts quickly falter by Grant arguing with Phil about the situation he has put them in, all the while Phil demands Grant to maintain their course against Johnny - who uses this opportunity to capture the brothers. Johnny later orders Danny to kill the brothers and bury them in the woods. After marching them into the forest for execution, Danny prepares to kill Grant; however, the brothers are saved when Jake appears and shoots Danny - accidentally killing him. After telling the brothers that it was Danny who killed Dennis on Johnny's orders, Jake allows Phil and Grant to flee whilst he himself proceeds to bury Danny in the woods. Phil and Grant rush back to Johnny's mansion to confront him once more, only to find out that he has already been arrested; Johnny surrendered to the police after his daughter, [[Ruby Allen|Ruby]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) threatened to disown her father unless he confessed to his crimes. Following his arrest, Johnny is sentenced to life imprisonment and later dies of a heart attack - allowing Phil and Grant to finally put their demons to reason for good. The brothers reconcile after Phil apologises to Grant for the situation he put them in, and Grant forgives Phil for his actions.\n\nAs time goes on, Grant begins flirting with [[Jane Beale|Jane Collins]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) - the girlfriend of Kathy's son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) - after seducing her. Their affair ends when Phil catches them together and Grant then has a [[one-night stand]] with 19-year-old [[Chelsea Fox]] - to his mother's outrage. Shortly after, his estranged Brazilian wife, [[Carla Mitchell|Carla]] ([[Christianne Oliveira]]), shows up in Walford. Grant and Carla resume their relationship, but Carla's ex-partner [[List of EastEnders characters (2006)#Ray|Ray]] ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) soon arrives to retrieve [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]12,000 that Carla has stolen from him. Carla and Ray resume their affair and plan to fleece Grant for \u00a325,000. Grant learns of Carla's scam; unbeknownst to Carla he chases Ray away and leads Carla to believe he has fallen for her lies. Grant catches her attempting to steal his money and reacts by dumping her in a litter bin, ending their marriage. After quitting his job at the newly reopened [[R&R (EastEnders)#Scarlet|Scarlet nightclub]], currently owed by Jake following Johnny's imprisonment, Grant leaves the country again with Courtney for a new life in Portugal.\n\n===2016===\nIn May 2016, Peggy returns to Albert Square following a diagnosis of terminal cancer. She decides to stop her treatment, but Phil tries to change her mind, enlisting the help of Sharon. Sharon then calls Grant in Portugal, leaving a voicemail saying that his family needs him. Grant returns to the square soon after and walks in on Phil and Peggy. He plans to take Peggy with him back to Portugal, only for her to say that her cancer is active. Grant is angry when Peggy reveals that her plan for him and Sam to learn about it was by letters to them after her death by suicide, however Phil and Grant seemingly convince Peggy not to do this. Grant tells Phil he immediately needs the money that he lent him. Knowing he cannot get it, Grant threatens him unless he returns the money. Grant returns to Portugal, and Sharon has to call him about Peggy having killed herself. When Sam returns to Walford for Peggy's funeral, she reveals that Grant is unable to attend the funeral, although Grant secretly attends, laying a flower and watching from a distance.\n\nWhen Grant's nephew [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) goes missing and Phil is reluctant to get the police involved, Sharon contacts Grant for help, but Courtney (now played by Alice Nokes) meets Sharon instead; Grant has not seen the messages. Sharon decides to go to the police and finds Grant outside the police station as a result of being drunk and disorderly. Grant goes to The Queen Vic where he flirts with [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]). Grant tells Courtney that Phil killed Peggy. When Courtney tells Grant that Sharon wanted to meet him, he goes to see Sharon and declares his love to her, but she is not interested. Grant accuses Phil of killing Peggy and asks for his money back, but Phil does not have it. Grant tries to persuade Sharon to go to Portugal with him but she declares her love for Phil. Grant telephones Courtney to ask to stay with her but she refuses. Grant then meets Belinda again and they go to her home for sex but are interrupted by her family. Phil finds a letter in Sharon's bag that Michelle sent Peggy, revealing that Grant fathered Michelle's child, [[Mark Fowler (2016 character)|Mark Fowler]] ([[Ned Porteous]]) 21 years previously. Grant visits Jane where he learns that she has been paralysed by her adoptive son [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington). He admits that he has lost his home and business in Portugal and is in debt. Grant and Jane both comfort each other, but Ian walks in on them and shouts at Grant for deserting his family. Grant leaves, ignoring Phil, who is attempting to tell him about Mark. Courtney calls Grant, who is staying with [[Aunt Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]) due to losing his villa and bar in Portugal, for help after Ben and [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) are kidnapped by the men who attacked Ben and killed his boyfriend [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]). Grant rushes to Courtney's aid and assumes Mark is attacking her, but Sharon tells him he is Michelle's son. Phil initially insists he does not need Grant's help but then accepts it. Phil collapses so Grant vows to rescue Ben. Mark gets in Grant's car to help him, and they find Ben and Grant scares off the men. Grant reconciles with Phil, admitting he no longer wants the money Phil borrowed from him, and Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Courtney is angry with Grant when he stops her kissing Mark. Grant confronts Ian about keeping the secret for so long and punches him after Ian insults his parenting skills. Sharon tells him the reasons Michelle did not want him involved and Grant agrees that Mark would be better off not knowing, but Jane convinces Grant otherwise, so Grant offers to take Mark for a drink. After a heart to heart, Grant realizes that Mark would be better off not knowing and decides to return to Portugal after seeing Phil. Phil gives him money, and he reunites with Courtney and the pair return to Portugal. Mark also works out who Grant is, but Sharon convinces him he is better off with his adoptive father - Tim.\n\n==Character creation==\n===Background===\nIn the latter part of 1989 ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], had taken over from [[Mike Gibbon]]. Ferguson had previously been a producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' \u2014 a hard-hitting and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging ''EastEnders'' in providing a realistic vision of modern life in [[London]]. Due to his success on ''The Bill'', [[Peter Cregeen]], the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comedic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] has said that it was a challenging period, but \"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAs a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters, including [[Marge Green]] ([[Pat Coombs]]), [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]), [[Trevor Short]] ([[Phil McDermott]]) and [[Paul Priestly]] ([[Mark Thrippleton]]), were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Two major new characters, the Mitchell brothers, made their first appearance in February 1990. Ferguson wanted to introduce a couple of young men who would bring an air of danger, characters who would be \"unpredictable\" and \"bursting with energy\". [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and Grant Mitchell went on to become major long-term characters, rooted firmly at the heart of the series.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Grant787.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Grant as he appeared in 1994.]]\nTo cast Phil and Grant Mitchell many actors were screen-tested together. This was done to assure that the chosen actors \u2014 who would work predominantly alongside each other \u2014 had a strong rapport and physical resemblance. Producer [[Corinne Hollingworth]] has commented: \"There were some good actors we had to turn down because we couldn't find the 'right' brother\". [[Ross Kemp]] was chosen to play Grant. Kemp was an actor with a stocky, muscular build and shaven hair, making him an ideal choice to play one of [[Walford]]'s latest \"tough-men\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-685-52957-7|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> [[Steve McFadden]] was given the role of Phil. Both actors worked well and convincingly together and both shared similar physical characteristics, such as short cropped hair and a \"round, open face\" \u2014 facial characteristics also shared by [[Danniella Westbrook]], who was chosen to play their sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Samantha]] partly because of this (Westbrook was later recast, with [[Kim Medcalf]] taking over).<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n===Personality===\nOf the two brothers Grant was the more volatile, but both had a sense of physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do it for him.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.\n\nGrant often displayed laddish, thrill-seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, gambling and living off of his wits.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> He became restless easily and actively sought the thrill of danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an indifference to the feelings of others, particularly the women in his life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this was that he was one of the few people who offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness.\n\nGrant took great pride in being a Mitchell, his late father had a local reputation as a [[Boxing|boxer]].<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> He always strived to live up to the family name and enjoyed the reputation he inherited and maintained.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> While Grant liked to think of himself as indestructible, he at many times showed emotional vulnerability and a need to be mothered.<ref name=\"20years\">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= ''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Indeed, at times he was just as likely to burst into tears as he was to throw a punch.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/644836.stm Happy Birthday EastEnders]\", ''BBC''.

Their arrival heralded a new era for the soap, which aptly coincided with the beginning of a new decade \u2014 ''EastEnders'' during the 1980s having been very much dominated by the hugely popular Fowler and Watts families.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2739361.stm | title= Phil to quit EastEnders | publisher = [[BBC]] | author = | date = 8 February 2003 | accessdate=26 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Sharongate===\n{{Main|Sharongate}}\nOne of the most notable and popular early storylines involving Grant was a love triangle between him, his brother and his wife [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] (played by [[Letitia Dean]]). Despite the fact that Sharon married Grant initially, ''EastEnders'' writer [[Tony Jordan]] has revealed in ''The Mitchells - The Full Story'' that the love-triangle storyline had been planned since Phil and Grant's introduction, after the writers came to the realisation that Sharon was perfect for them both.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders//news/news_content/news_20060306.shtml Mitchells Special]\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 18 September 2006.</ref> This storyline was slow burning and was spread over several years, providing a plethora of dramatic tension along the way. The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 in one of the soap's notorious [[EastEnders two-hander episodes#Notable three-handers|three-handers]]. Sue Dunderdale directed the episodes and the performances of McFadden, Kemp and Dean have been described as memorable and filled with high-tension drama.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Things finally came to a head in 1994 with some of ''EastEnders''' most popular and renowned episodes, which have been dubbed \"[[Sharongate]]\".<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19941025.shtml Sharongate]\", ''BBC''.

The repercussions of Phil's betrayal contributed to many subsequent storylines involving the brothers throughout the 1990s. Writer of Sharongate, Tony Jordan, has stated that of all the storylines he has penned for the soap, Sharongate is the one he is most proud of. He comments \"Three of the strongest characters that have ever been in ''EastEnders'' are the Mitchell brothers and Sharon... when we actually blew that story it was incredible... being able to reach that many people with your work is what makes ''EastEnders'' exciting.\"<ref>\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3wvSweMWU Tony Jordan interview]\", ''youtube''.

Their relationship was a typical portrayal of [[unrequited love]] on Tiffany's side and was fraught with tragedy and drama. For Grant it was more a [[marriage of convenience]], allowing him access to his daughter, [[Courtney Mitchell|Courtney]]. Grant's poor treatment of Tiffany included physical and emotional abuse and two affairs, one of which was with her mother [[Louise Raymond|Louise]] (played by [[Carol Harrison]]) and the other with [[Lorraine Wicks]] (played by [[Jacqueline Leonard]]). Their volatile relationship made headlines in July 1997 amid reports that ''EastEnders'' bosses were considering airing a highly controversial storyline that saw Tiffany brutally raped by Grant. The plot, which was slated to be aired on Christmas Day 1997, evoked high criticism from female MPs and children's groups, TV clean-up campaigners and church officials, who were all expressive in unanimous condemnation about the BBC's \"cynical ploy to win the seasonal ratings war over arch-rival ''[[Coronation Street]]''.\" Labour MP Anne Clywd suggested that the BBC should \"reconsider\" and Michelle Elliott, director of the children's charity [[Kidscape]], said: \"This is an appalling, outrageous, utterly nauseous example of rape for ratings.\" Reports also alleged that actor Ross Kemp was not happy about the plot either and threatened to quit the role unless the scripts were altered. Subsequently, the plot never came to fruition.<ref name=\"rapeplot\">\"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19970727/ai_n14465885 EastEnder hardman Ross says he'll quit over Christmas Day rape plot]\", ''Sunday Mirror''.

The storyline signifying his departure played heavily on the Mitchell brothers' fragile and damaged relationship. After discovering that Grant vengefully had sex with his wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Mitchell]], Phil went ballistic with a [[Pistol|handgun]] causing the car Grant was driving to career at high speed into the [[River Thames]]. The episode was written by Tony Jordan, directed by Paul Annett and was watched by 19.5 million viewers.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19991014.shtml The Mitchell car crash]\", ''BBC''.

Executive producer, [[Kate Harwood]], commented: \"We are so pleased that Ross will be back on the show. His character is one of the most iconic and popular in the history of soap.

Kemp was persuaded to return to the role for brief stints during a period of heavy media criticism aimed at ''EastEnders''. The return proved to be a ratings success. Kemp reprised the role of Grant for various guest stints in 2016, appearing in twelve episodes between 13 May and 9 September.\n\nThroughout the course of his 1990s duration, Grant established himself as one of the show's most prominent characters. He was portrayed as a tough persona, wildly known for his fiery temper and his tendency to resort to violence. Despite this, however, his [[Mitchell family|family]] is important to him \u2013 particularly his relationship with his older brother [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Known as the \"Mitchell brothers\", Grant and Phil have become household names in the United Kingdom \u2013 due to their association with the stereotypical black [[leather jacket]] wearing bald and brutal thug. They have been parodied even in adverts where their gruff, tough talking, cockney accents have been impersonated. One of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most popular and highly rated storylines was \"[[Sharongate]]\", where Grant discovers that his wife [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) has been having an affair with his brother. In light of this iconic revelation, Grant attacked Phil and exact revenge on Sharon until she departed the programme following her betrayal. Grant then went on to embark on a second marriage with local barmaid [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), up to the point where she gave birth to their daughter \u2013 [[Courtney Mitchell|Courtney]]. However, their marriage ended in tragedy when Grant's longstanding mistreatment towards Tiffany ultimately led to her being accidentally killed by Peggy's would-be second husband [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]).\n\nThe character has also become a prime suspect in the murder of Sharon's hated boss [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), which later triggered a quarrel with her best-friend [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]); clashed with his  mother's campaign rival [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]]); sparked a number of altercations Sam's former boyfriend [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]); cheated on Tiffany by having an affair with her mother [[Louise Raymond|Louise]] ([[Carol Harrison]]); developed a feud with his archenemy [[Beppe di Marco]] ([[Michael Greco (actor)|Michael Greco]]); disputed with Beppe's younger brother [[Gianni di Marco|Gianni]] ([[Marc Bannerman]]); worked with Palmer's daughter [[Annie Palmer|Annie]] ([[Nadia Sawalha]]) on a jointed business venture at the local gym; established an antagonistic business partnership with Phil's would-be sworn nemesis, [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]); had a one-night stand with Phil's estranged wife [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]); exonerated Sam for the murder of Sharon's illegitimate father, [[Den Watts|Den]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), by proving to his ex-wife that her stepmother [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) was responsible for the crime; teamed up with Phil to confront their mother's gangland enemy, [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]), and get justice for the death of Sharon's adopted brother-turned-newly husband [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) in the [[Get Johnny Week]] scenario; infuriated Kathy's son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) by having an affair with his eventual lover [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]); ended his third ill-fated marriage to [[Carla Mitchell|Carla]] ([[Christianne Oliveira]]) upon learning that she turned him against Courtney; and discovered that he is the father of Michelle's secret son, [[Mark Fowler (2016 character)|Mark]] ([[Ned Porteous]]), in light of coping with losing his mother Peggy to cancer.\n\nDespite his tough nature, he is also a womanizer and has been involved in several relationships with an array of women - including [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]), [[Lorraine Wicks]] ([[Jacqueline Leonard]]), [[Nina Harris]] ([[Troy Titus-Adams]]), and [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]). He has calmed down in recent years, although Grant is still feared by people in and around Walford.\n\n==Storylines==\n===1990\u20131999===\nGrant Mitchell first arrived in [[Albert Square]] with his older brother [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), and the pair become co-owners of the local garage - The Arches. Grant had returned from being a [[paratrooper]] in the [[British Army|Army]] who got involved in the [[Falklands War]]. After a brief fling with [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]) and getting involved in various dodgy deals, Grant starts wooing the local barmaid - [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). She grows attracted to his machismo, and soon their flirting progresses into a relationship. Fiercely protective of his girlfriend, most of Grant's initial problems in the Square revolve around his over-possessive nature and jealousy. He puts Sharon's boss [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), the landlord of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], in hospital after he makes a pass at Sharon; he later becomes prime suspect for Royle's murder, but is proven innocent when the killer is revealed to be [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) - a local thug who eventually owns up to the crime. In the wake of this, Grant decides to re-enlist in the army; however, he is left despondent after getting rejected for failing their psychiatric tests.\n\n[[File:Grant shax.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Grant and [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] marry (1991).]]\n\nDespite his hot-headed tendencies, Sharon sees a different side to Grant, and when he proposes marriage to her, she accepts on the condition that he buys her her childhood home, The Queen Vic, which he does. Grant marries Sharon and together they run The Queen Vic. Their marriage is stormy and punctuated with violent rows and fights. Grant is desperate for a child, and when he discovers Sharon is still taking contraception, he smashes up the pub and then disappears.  In his absence, Sharon is comforted by Phil and they begin an affair, although this comes to an abrupt end when Grant returns and promises to change his ways. He cannot live up to his promises however, and on Sharon's birthday, Grant sets fire to The Queen Vic to generate insurance money to pay off debts. He does not check to see if Sharon is out of the way, and she and her dog [[Roly]] nearly die in the blaze. The insurance money is insufficient, and Sharon reacts with fury when she discovers what Grant has done. She leaves Grant for a while, and when she returns and attempts to seize control of The Queen Vic; Grant turns violent, assaults Sharon and her best friend [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) and is imprisoned on remand. While he is in prison, Sharon and Phil rekindle their affair, but neither can confess to Grant, and it ends when he is released from prison. Sharon and Grant patch up their relationship; however, Grant discovers a tape on which Sharon talks about her affair with Phil, and plays it to a packed pub at Phil's engagement party to his fiance - [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). In response, Grant batters Phil in revenge - leaving him with a [[ruptured spleen]] - and bullies Sharon until she flees to the [[United States]]. She returns briefly to enact revenge, making Grant realise that he is still in love with her, he chooses to be with Sharon over his family. Sharon is ready to turn him down in front of a packed pub and his family. However, in the end, she cannot go through with it, and stops him from publicly proposing before he humiliates himself. She then confesses to him that she still loves him, before returning to the US, leaving Grant heartbroken.\n\nMichelle has a volatile relationship with Grant but, following Sharon's exit, falls pregnant following a [[one-night stand]] with him and then flees to the US without telling Grant that he is to be a father. Grant would not find out that the baby is his until years later. He goes on to marry [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), who soon becomes pregnant - although it is unclear whether he or Tiffany's ex-partner [[Tony Hills|Tony]] ([[Mark Homer]]) is the father of her child. When Grant discovers this, he is incensed and throws Tiffany out. He begins a relationship with [[Lorraine Wicks]] ([[Jacqueline Leonard]]), until a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity test]] reveals that Grant is the father of his baby, [[Courtney Mitchell|Courtney]] (Carissa and Josephine O'Meara). He reunites with Tiffany to be near his daughter, but by this time his marriage has deteriorated. When Tiffany discovers that Grant has had an affair with her mother [[Louise Raymond]] ([[Carol Harrison]]), she plans to flee to [[Spain]] with Courtney. However, Grant discovers her plan and retrieves Courtney. Tiffany attempts to snatch Courtney, but is hit by a car driven by Grant's stepfather [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]); she dies instantly as the clock struck midnight. Grant tries to move on by dating barmaid [[Nina Harris]] ([[Troy Titus-Adams]]) for a while, but dumps her after discovering the latter's past as a [[prostitute]] is uncovered.\n\nIt is at this point that Grant and Phil have established themselves as the undisputed hardman of the square's local borough - [[Walford]]; the pair have spent the entirely of the 1990s decade embarking on criminal activities, amongst other separate shenanigans. Despite the majority of occasions when the pair clashed, particularly in the follow-up to Phil's affair with Sharon, the two brothers remained faithful to each other. This impact heightens in 1999 when Grant goes into partnership with Phil's archenemy [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]]), and they end up having a feud - which ends with Grant punching Steve after getting annoyed with his disrespectful attitude towards him. By then, Grant and Phil have conducted a plan to cheat some gangsters by intercepting a [[Illegal drug trade|drug deal]] and stealing a large amount of cash - in order to take care of their debts. The job is initially successful, but is quickly grows obstructive when Phil finds out that Grant had slept his ex-wife Kathy before doing the job. He confronts Grant after the job and Grant admits he did it in revenge for Phil having sex with Sharon. As they attempt to flee from the oncoming police, Phil pulls out a gun and shoots the steering wheel in their getaway car - causing Grant to plunge the car into the [[River Thames]]. Phil is rescued, but Grant is not found and presumed dead. It soon transpires a week later that Grant has survived, and he leaves the country with both Courtney and the stolen money to [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n===2005\u20132006===\nGrant returns to Walford with Phil to exonerate their younger sister, [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]), for the murder of her ex-boss and Sharon's adopted father - [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]). Although she was involved in the events surrounding Den's murder, Sam was framed for the crime by his widow and her nemesis [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) - the real murderer. Grant manages to put behind him his differences with both Phil and Sharon, forgiving Sharon when she confesses that she aborted his child. The two brothers manage to convince Sharon that Chrissie is the real killer and that Sam is innocent. Whilst teaming up with Phil and Sharon to prove Sam's innocence, Grant forms a rivalry with her husband [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) - who had previously teamed up with Den to imprison Phil for robbery. Grant and Dennis soon put their differences aside to help Phil with their conflict against [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]), the local gangland kingpin who holds a grudge against the Mitchell brothers because of their mother - [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). When Johnny extracts CCTV footage of Chrissie confessing to her boyfriend [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) that she killed Den, he plans to use the tape as bait for Phil and Grant - intending to kill them. The brothers eventually beat Johnny at his nightclub office in order to get the tape, which is promptly delivered to the police; as a result, Sam is released from prison and Chrissie is arrested for Den's murder.\n\nFollowing Sam's release, Grant initially returns to Rio - only to later come back to Walford with Courtney (now played by [[Megan Jossa]]), citing family and financial problems back in Brazil. When Phil learns about his brother's return, he tricks Grant into helping him with quest against Johnny. During Grant's absence, Phil and Johnny embarked on a feud that led to Dennis and Sharon getting involved. The impact escalated after Dennis humiliated Johnny on Christmas Day 2005, which prompted Johnny to throttle Sharon with an ultimatum; Dennis will be killed unless she and him leave Walford for good. On the eve of 2006 commencing, Dennis learned from Phil about the threat Johnny made to Sharon - as well as being told that Johnny killed his best-friend and Sam's ex-husband, [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]), on the same night Chrissie killed Den. This resulted in Dennis beating up Johnny, who then ordered Jake's brother [[Danny Moon|Danny]] ([[Jake Maskall]]) - his henchman - to kill Dennis. Following Dennis' murder, Phil was wracked with guilt for sparking the events of Sharon losing her husband and has vowed revenge on Johnny more than ever. After hearing Phil explain his reasons for wanting to bring Johnny to justice for killing Dennis, specifically as a promise he made to Sharon before she left Walford, Grant reluctantly accompanies his brother in settling their score with Johnny once and for all. Their efforts quickly falter by Grant arguing with Phil about the situation he has put them in, all the while Phil demands Grant to maintain their course against Johnny - who uses this opportunity to capture the brothers. Johnny later orders Danny to kill the brothers and bury them in the woods. After marching them into the forest for execution, Danny prepares to kill Grant; however, the brothers are saved when Jake appears and shoots Danny - accidentally killing him. After telling the brothers that it was Danny who killed Dennis on Johnny's orders, Jake allows Phil and Grant to flee whilst he himself proceeds to bury Danny in the woods. Phil and Grant rush back to Johnny's mansion to confront him once more, only to find out that he has already been arrested; Johnny surrendered to the police after his daughter, [[Ruby Allen|Ruby]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) threatened to disown her father unless he confessed to his crimes. Following his arrest, Johnny is sentenced to life imprisonment and later dies of a heart attack - allowing Phil and Grant to finally put their demons to reason for good. The brothers reconcile after Phil apologises to Grant for the situation he put them in, and Grant forgives Phil for his actions.\n\nAs time goes on, Grant begins flirting with [[Jane Beale|Jane Collins]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) - the girlfriend of Kathy's son [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) - after seducing her. Their affair ends when Phil catches them together and Grant then has a [[one-night stand]] with 19-year-old [[Chelsea Fox]] - to his mother's outrage. Shortly after, his estranged Brazilian wife, [[Carla Mitchell|Carla]] ([[Christianne Oliveira]]), shows up in Walford. Grant and Carla resume their relationship, but Carla's ex-partner [[List of EastEnders characters (2006)#Ray|Ray]] ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) soon arrives to retrieve [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]12,000 that Carla has stolen from him. Carla and Ray resume their affair and plan to fleece Grant for \u00a325,000. Grant learns of Carla's scam; unbeknownst to Carla he chases Ray away and leads Carla to believe he has fallen for her lies. Grant catches her attempting to steal his money and reacts by dumping her in a litter bin, ending their marriage. After quitting his job at the newly reopened [[R&R (EastEnders)#Scarlet|Scarlet nightclub]], currently owed by Jake following Johnny's imprisonment, Grant leaves the country again with Courtney for a new life in Portugal.\n\n===2016===\nIn May 2016, Peggy returns to Albert Square following a diagnosis of terminal cancer. She decides to stop her treatment, but Phil tries to change her mind, enlisting the help of Sharon. Sharon then calls Grant in Portugal, leaving a voicemail saying that his family needs him. Grant returns to the square soon after and walks in on Phil and Peggy. He plans to take Peggy with him back to Portugal, only for her to say that her cancer is active. Grant is angry when Peggy reveals that her plan for him and Sam to learn about it was by letters to them after her death by suicide, however Phil and Grant seemingly convince Peggy not to do this. Grant tells Phil he immediately needs the money that he lent him. Knowing he cannot get it, Grant threatens him unless he returns the money. Grant returns to Portugal, and Sharon has to call him about Peggy having killed herself. When Sam returns to Walford for Peggy's funeral, she reveals that Grant is unable to attend the funeral, although Grant secretly attends, laying a flower and watching from a distance.\n\nWhen Grant's nephew [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) goes missing and Phil is reluctant to get the police involved, Sharon contacts Grant for help, but Courtney (now played by Alice Nokes) meets Sharon instead; Grant has not seen the messages. Sharon decides to go to the police and finds Grant outside the police station as a result of being drunk and disorderly. Grant goes to The Queen Vic where he flirts with [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]). Grant tells Courtney that Phil killed Peggy. When Courtney tells Grant that Sharon wanted to meet him, he goes to see Sharon and declares his love to her, but she is not interested. Grant accuses Phil of killing Peggy and asks for his money back, but Phil does not have it. Grant tries to persuade Sharon to go to Portugal with him but she declares her love for Phil. Grant telephones Courtney to ask to stay with her but she refuses. Grant then meets Belinda again and they go to her home for sex but are interrupted by her family. Phil finds a letter in Sharon's bag that Michelle sent Peggy, revealing that Grant fathered Michelle's child, [[Mark Fowler (2016 character)|Mark Fowler]] ([[Ned Porteous]]) 21 years previously. Grant visits Jane where he learns that she has been paralysed by her adoptive son [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington). He admits that he has lost his home and business in Portugal and is in debt. Grant and Jane both comfort each other, but Ian walks in on them and shouts at Grant for deserting his family. Grant leaves, ignoring Phil, who is attempting to tell him about Mark. Courtney calls Grant, who is staying with [[Aunt Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]) due to losing his villa and bar in Portugal, for help after Ben and [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) are kidnapped by the men who attacked Ben and killed his boyfriend [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]). Grant rushes to Courtney's aid and assumes Mark is attacking her, but Sharon tells him he is Michelle's son. Phil initially insists he does not need Grant's help but then accepts it. Phil collapses so Grant vows to rescue Ben. Mark gets in Grant's car to help him, and they find Ben and Grant scares off the men. Grant reconciles with Phil, admitting he no longer wants the money Phil borrowed from him, and Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Courtney is angry with Grant when he stops her kissing Mark. Grant confronts Ian about keeping the secret for so long and punches him after Ian insults his parenting skills. Sharon tells him the reasons Michelle did not want him involved and Grant agrees that Mark would be better off not knowing, but Jane convinces Grant otherwise, so Grant offers to take Mark for a drink. After a heart to heart, Grant realizes that Mark would be better off not knowing and decides to return to Portugal after seeing Phil. Phil gives him money, and he reunites with Courtney and the pair return to Portugal. Mark also works out who Grant is, but Sharon convinces him he is better off with his adoptive father - Tim.\n\n==Character creation==\n===Background===\nIn the latter part of 1989 ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], had taken over from [[Mike Gibbon]]. Ferguson had previously been a producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' \u2014 a hard-hitting and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging ''EastEnders'' in providing a realistic vision of modern life in [[London]]. Due to his success on ''The Bill'', [[Peter Cregeen]], the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comedic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] has said that it was a challenging period, but \"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAs a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters, including [[Marge Green]] ([[Pat Coombs]]), [[Julie Cooper (EastEnders)|Julie Cooper]] ([[Louise Plowright]]), [[Trevor Short]] ([[Phil McDermott]]) and [[Paul Priestly]] ([[Mark Thrippleton]]), were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Two major new characters, the Mitchell brothers, made their first appearance in February 1990. Ferguson wanted to introduce a couple of young men who would bring an air of danger, characters who would be \"unpredictable\" and \"bursting with energy\". [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and Grant Mitchell went on to become major long-term characters, rooted firmly at the heart of the series.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Grant787.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Grant as he appeared in 1994.]]\nTo cast Phil and Grant Mitchell many actors were screen-tested together. This was done to assure that the chosen actors \u2014 who would work predominantly alongside each other \u2014 had a strong rapport and physical resemblance. Producer [[Corinne Hollingworth]] has commented: \"There were some good actors we had to turn down because we couldn't find the 'right' brother\". [[Ross Kemp]] was chosen to play Grant. Kemp was an actor with a stocky, muscular build and shaven hair, making him an ideal choice to play one of [[Walford]]'s latest \"tough-men\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-685-52957-7|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> [[Steve McFadden]] was given the role of Phil. Both actors worked well and convincingly together and both shared similar physical characteristics, such as short cropped hair and a \"round, open face\" \u2014 facial characteristics also shared by [[Danniella Westbrook]], who was chosen to play their sister [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Samantha]] partly because of this (Westbrook was later recast, with [[Kim Medcalf]] taking over).<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n===Personality===\nOf the two brothers Grant was the more volatile, but both had a sense of physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do it for him.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.\n\nGrant often displayed laddish, thrill-seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, gambling and living off of his wits.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> He became restless easily and actively sought the thrill of danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an indifference to the feelings of others, particularly the women in his life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this was that he was one of the few people who offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness.\n\nGrant took great pride in being a Mitchell, his late father had a local reputation as a [[Boxing|boxer]].<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> He always strived to live up to the family name and enjoyed the reputation he inherited and maintained.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> While Grant liked to think of himself as indestructible, he at many times showed emotional vulnerability and a need to be mothered.<ref name=\"20years\">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= ''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Indeed, at times he was just as likely to burst into tears as he was to throw a punch.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/644836.stm Happy Birthday EastEnders]\", ''BBC''.

Their arrival heralded a new era for the soap, which aptly coincided with the beginning of a new decade \u2014 ''EastEnders'' during the 1980s having been very much dominated by the hugely popular Fowler and Watts families.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2739361.stm | title= Phil to quit EastEnders | publisher = [[BBC]] | author = | date = 8 February 2003 | accessdate=26 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Sharongate===\n{{Main|Sharongate}}\nOne of the most notable and popular early storylines involving Grant was a love triangle between him, his brother and his wife [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] (played by [[Letitia Dean]]). Despite the fact that Sharon married Grant initially, ''EastEnders'' writer [[Tony Jordan]] has revealed in ''The Mitchells - The Full Story'' that the love-triangle storyline had been planned since Phil and Grant's introduction, after the writers came to the realisation that Sharon was perfect for them both.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders//news/news_content/news_20060306.shtml Mitchells Special]\", ''BBC''.

The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 in one of the soap's notorious [[EastEnders two-hander episodes#Notable three-handers|three-handers]]. Sue Dunderdale directed the episodes and the performances of McFadden, Kemp and Dean have been described as memorable and filled with high-tension drama.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Things finally came to a head in 1994 with some of ''EastEnders''' most popular and renowned episodes, which have been dubbed \"[[Sharongate]]\".<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19941025.shtml Sharongate]\", ''BBC''.

The repercussions of Phil's betrayal contributed to many subsequent storylines involving the brothers throughout the 1990s. Writer of Sharongate, Tony Jordan, has stated that of all the storylines he has penned for the soap, Sharongate is the one he is most proud of. He comments \"Three of the strongest characters that have ever been in ''EastEnders'' are the Mitchell brothers and Sharon... when we actually blew that story it was incredible... being able to reach that many people with your work is what makes ''EastEnders'' exciting.\"<ref>\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3wvSweMWU Tony Jordan interview]\", ''youtube''.

Their relationship was a typical portrayal of [[unrequited love]] on Tiffany's side and was fraught with tragedy and drama. For Grant it was more a [[marriage of convenience]], allowing him access to his daughter, [[Courtney Mitchell|Courtney]]. Grant's poor treatment of Tiffany included physical and emotional abuse and two affairs, one of which was with her mother [[Louise Raymond|Louise]] (played by [[Carol Harrison]]) and the other with [[Lorraine Wicks]] (played by [[Jacqueline Leonard]]). Their volatile relationship made headlines in July 1997 amid reports that ''EastEnders'' bosses were considering airing a highly controversial storyline that saw Tiffany brutally raped by Grant. The plot, which was slated to be aired on Christmas Day 1997, evoked high criticism from female MPs and children's groups, TV clean-up campaigners and church officials, who were all expressive in unanimous condemnation about the BBC's \"cynical ploy to win the seasonal ratings war over arch-rival ''[[Coronation Street]]''.\" Labour MP Anne Clywd suggested that the BBC should \"reconsider\" and Michelle Elliott, director of the children's charity [[Kidscape]], said: \"This is an appalling, outrageous, utterly nauseous example of rape for ratings.\" Reports also alleged that actor Ross Kemp was not happy about the plot either and threatened to quit the role unless the scripts were altered.

On August 30, 1983 Casey defeated [[Adrian Adonis]] to win the Southwest Championship Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Southwest Championship Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship title history|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/san_antonio/scw/scw-h.html}}</ref> A month later, on September 11 he defeated [[Tully Blanchard]] to win the [[SWCW Southwest Heavyweight Championship]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Southwest Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship title history|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/san_antonio/scw/scw-sw-h.html}}</ref> In September, Casey also held the [[SWCW Southwest Tag Team Championship]] with [[Buddy Mareno]], replacing the 'injured' [[Bobby Jaggers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Southwest Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship title history|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/san_antonio/scw/scw-sw-t.html}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving SCW he went to [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] where he was managed by [[Sunshine (wrestling)|Sunshine]]. Casey and Sunshine would also bring in The [[Great Kabuki]] in a feud with [[Jim Cornette]] and [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]], and later Kabuki after he turned on Scott and Sunshine. [[John Tatum (wrestler)|John Tatum]] and [[Missy Hyatt]] would also show up and work a program with Casey and Sunshine too.

He immediately began wrestling full-time for the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and was programmed into a short [[house show]] series against heel cowboy wrestler [[Ron Bass]]. Casey was slotted into an upper level opening card [[enhancement talent]], losing that summer to the likes of [[Rick Rude]] and [[The Honky Tonk Man]]  but also defeating [[Jose Estrada, Sr.|Jose Estrada]], [[Mike Sharpe]] and [[Steve Lombardi]]. On WWF television he was used primarily as an [[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]], and would not gain his first televised victory until the September 24, 1987 edition of [[Prime Time Wrestling]] where he teamed with [[SD Jones]] to defeat [[The Shadows]]. He would gain his first televised singles victory a month later, when he pinned Iron Mike Sharpe on the October 15th edition of Prime Time Wrestling. <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm</ref>\n\nThe winter and spring of 1988 found Casey continuing to be in the opening cards of the numerous WWF house shows, facing [[Danny Spivey]], [[Terry Gibbs]], [[Steve Lombardi]], and a returning [[Iron Shiek]]. While still being primarily utilized as an enhancement talent on television, Casey also remained under a modicum of a push and defeated [[Barry Horowitz]] on the March 7th, 1988 edition of Prime Time Wrestling, and then Mike Sharpe in the May 2nd episode. This status continued throughout most of 1988 as he lost to upper level competition, but defeated the likes of [[Richard Charland]] and [[Pete Doherty]] on house shows and on television. His most high-profile appearance came at the [[Survivor Series (1988)|1988 Survivor Series]] (substituting for an injured [[B. Brian Blair]]) where he teamed with [[Jake Roberts]], [[Tito Santana]], [[Ken Patera]] and [[Jim Duggan]] in a losing effort against [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], [[Rick Rude]], [[Curt \"Mr. Perfect\" Hennig]], [[Harley Race]] and [[Dino Bravo]]. <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm</ref>\n\nCasey's appearances became more sporadic in 1989, and he only wrestled on 11 occasions after appearing in well over five times as many matches the previous year. His final match of the year was against Barry Horowitz on March 24th in Salt Lake City, UT, after which he departed the company. <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm</ref>\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation (1991) ===\nCasey made a one match return to the WWF when he appeared on March 26th, 1991 at a taping of WWF Superstars.

The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank to have acted as guarantor and to have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Dr. Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to a) establishment and financing of GrameenPhone, a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian government owned multinational Telenor by Dr Yunus, and b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Dr Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank.  The commission also examined the legal status of the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Dr. Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership.  The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Dr. Yunus.  Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Dr Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|title=Interim report of the Grameen Bank Commission|publisher=Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh|accessdate=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124442/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of ideas===\n{{see also|Impact of microcredit}}\nMicrofinance has been criticised in the foreign media.

The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank to have acted as guarantor and to have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Dr. Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to a) establishment and financing of GrameenPhone, a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian government owned multinational Telenor by Dr Yunus, and b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Dr Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank.  The commission also examined the legal status of the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Dr. Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership.  The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Dr. Yunus.  Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Dr Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|title=Interim report of the Grameen Bank Commission|publisher=Ministry of Finance of the Government of Bangladesh|accessdate=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303124442/http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/gb/Grameen_Bank_Interim_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of ideas===\n{{see also|Impact of microcredit}}\nMicrofinance has been criticised in the foreign media.

McLouth\n| products      = Low carbon and stainless strip steel\n}}\n'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in North America to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n==First Continuous Caster==\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n===Pilot Plant===\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n===Casting Plant Description===\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n==First Use of Slab Induction Heating==\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nAlthough a contentious topic, McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref>. Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Other factors were multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref>. McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", it invested heavily in new technologies. Workers/supervisors often did not know how to get the full potential from the machines. McLouth bore not only high costs to implement, but additional losses from lack of optimization. Some also cite aging and incorrectly-sized equipment, along with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s to mid-1990s. The subsequently-lowered quality of steel created reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| name          = McLouth Steel Corporation\n| logo          = [[image:McLouth Steel Logo.svg|200px]]\n| fate          = Bankruptcy\n| successor     = Detroit Steel Company\n| foundation    = 1934\n| defunct       = 1996\n| location      = [[Detroit, MI]] 1934-1981, [[Trenton, MI]] 1982-1996\n| industry      = [[Steel]]\n| key_people    = Donald B.

The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref>. Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in North America to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n==First Continuous Caster==\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n===Pilot Plant===\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n===Casting Plant Description===\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n==First Use of Slab Induction Heating==\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nAlthough a contentious topic, McLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref>. Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Other factors were multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref>. McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", it invested heavily in new technologies. Workers/supervisors often did not know how to get the full potential from the machines. McLouth bore not only high costs to implement, but additional losses from lack of optimization. Some also cite aging and incorrectly-sized equipment, along with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s to mid-1990s. The subsequently-lowered quality of steel created reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Ty5150", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLouth_Steel"}
