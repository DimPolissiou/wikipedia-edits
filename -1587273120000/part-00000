In this role he handled Cromwell's household business and was also involved in drafting and writing his correspondence.  By 1529, he had become one of Cromwell's most trusted friends and was appointed as an executor of his will.{{sfn|Phillips|2004}} Between 1525 and 1529, his name appeared in Cromwell's correspondence in connection with suppression of monasteries.  It is probably around this time that his talents came to the attention of the king.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=993}} He was granted the manor and lands from the suppressed [[St Leonard's Priory, London|St Leonard's Priory]] in Bow.\n\nIt was probably soon after Cromwell's elevation to the peerage, on 9 July 1536, that Sadler was named a gentleman of the [[Privy Chamber]].{{sfn|Henderson|1897|p=109}}  In the same year, he became [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]] for [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon, Wiltshire]]{{sfn|Coros|1982}} and his name also appears in the list of administrators named for [[Catherine of Aragon]]'s will.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/252/mode/2up 253]}}\n\nIn January 1537, Sadler was sent to [[Scotland]] to investigate complaints made by [[Margaret Tudor]], the King's sister, against her third husband, [[Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven]], and to improve Anglo-Scottish relations. He succeeded in both respects. On 1 April 1537, Ralph met [[James V of Scotland]], newly married to [[Madeleine of Valois]], at [[Rouen]].{{sfn|Paul|1907|p=[https://archive.org/stream/accountslordhig00treagoog#page/n78/mode/2up 21]}}\n\nThe King was pleased with Sadler's work, and sent him again to Scotland, this time to discourage the King of Scotland, James V, from accepting [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton's]] proposed Franco-Scottish alliance. Sadlier failed in that respect, but the King was nonetheless impressed with his work.

In this role he handled Cromwell's household business and was also involved in drafting and writing his correspondence.  By 1529, he had become one of Cromwell's most trusted friends and was appointed as an executor of his will.{{sfn|Phillips|2004}} Between 1525 and 1529, his name appeared in Cromwell's correspondence in connection with suppression of monasteries.  It is probably around this time that his talents came to the attention of the king.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=993}} He was granted the manor and lands from the suppressed [[St Leonard's Priory, London|St Leonard's Priory]] in Bow.\n\nIt was probably soon after Cromwell's elevation to the peerage, on 9 July 1536, that Sadler was named a gentleman of the [[Privy Chamber]].{{sfn|Henderson|1897|p=109}}  In the same year, he became [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]] for [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon, Wiltshire]]{{sfn|Coros|1982}} and his name also appears in the list of administrators named for [[Catherine of Aragon]]'s will.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/252/mode/2up 253]}}\n\nIn January 1537, Sadler was sent to [[Scotland]] to investigate complaints made by [[Margaret Tudor]], the King's sister, against her third husband, [[Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven]], and to improve Anglo-Scottish relations. He succeeded in both respects. On 1 April 1537, Ralph met [[James V of Scotland]], newly married to [[Madeleine of Valois]], at [[Rouen]].{{sfn|Paul|1907|p=[https://archive.org/stream/accountslordhig00treagoog#page/n78/mode/2up 21]}}\n\nThe King was pleased with Sadler's work, and sent him again to Scotland, this time to discourage the King of Scotland, James V, from accepting [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton's]] proposed Franco-Scottish alliance. Sadlier failed in that respect, but the King was nonetheless impressed with his work. In 1539 he was elected [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]].\n\n=== Mr. Secretary: Henry VIII and Edward VI, 1540 to 1557 ===\nIn April 1540, Sadler was made [[Secretary of State (England)|principal secretary]] to the king, a position he held jointly with [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]]. In the same year, he was knighted, made a [[privy councillor]], and began more than 30 years of service representing [[Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertfordshire]] in Parliament.
