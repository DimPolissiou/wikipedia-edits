After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming.

The meeting included Singer's group, the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], and ExxonMobil. Newsweek said that, according to an eight-page memo that was leaked, the meeting proposed a $5-million campaign to convince the public that the science of global warming was controversial and uncertain. The plan was leaked to the press and never implemented.<ref name=Begley>Begley, Sharon.

Singer responded with a letter to ''Science'' saying the IPCC report had presented material selectively. He wrote: \"the Summary does not even mention the existence of 18 years of weather satellite data that show a slight global cooling trend, contradicting all theoretical models of climate warming.\"<ref>Singer, Fred.

When adjustment was made for transient events the data showed a slight warming, and research suggested that the discrepancy between surface and satellite data was largely accounted for by problems such as instrument differences between satellites.<ref>Parson, Edward A., and Dessler, Andrew E.

The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: \"Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol\u2014to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community\u2014is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.\"<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\nScheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned. At least 20 were television weather reporters, some did not have science degrees, and 14 were listed as professors without specifying a field. According to Scheuering, some of them later said they believed they were signing a document in favour of action against climate change.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\n{{anchor|NIPCC}}Singer set up the '''Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change''' (NIPCC) after a 2004 United Nations climate conference in Milan.

When the Nazis invaded, the family fled, Singer leaving on a children's transport train with other Jewish children. He ended up in England, where he lived in [[Northumberland]], working for a time as a teenage optician.

Scheuering writes that his work involved conducting experiments on rockets and satellites, remote sensing, [[radiation belts]], the [[magnetosphere]], and [[meteorites]]. He developed a new method of launching rockets into space: firing them from a high-flying plane, both with and without a pilot. The Navy adopted the idea and Singer supervised the project. He received a White House Special Commendation from [[President Eisenhower]] in 1954 for his work.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\nHe became one of 12 board members of the [[American Astronautical Society]], an organization formed in 1954 to represent the country's 300 leading scientists and engineers in the area of guided missiles\u2014he was one of seven members of the board to resign in December 1956 after a series of disputes about the direction and control of the group.<ref>Schumach, Murray.

''Intelligent Life in the Universe'', San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1966.</ref> that the orbit of the [[Mars|Martian]] moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] suggests that it is hollow, which implies it is of artificial origin. Singer wrote: \"My conclusion there is, and here I back Shklovsky, that if the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.\"<ref>S. F. Singer, \"More on the Moons of Mars\", ''Astronautics'', February 1960, American Astronautical Society, page 16.</ref> Later measurements confirmed Singer's ''big \"if\"'' caveat: Shklovsky overestimated Phobos' rate of altitude loss due to bad early data.<ref>E.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming.

He went back to play for Br\u00f8ndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] of Br\u00f8ndby to the 1st Division.\n\nAt Br\u00f8ndby, Laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st Division debut game, as fellow promoted team [[Boldklubben 1909]] were beaten 7\u20131. He scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st Division. His accomplishments earned him the 1982 [[Danish Player of the Year]] award. He played part of the 1983 season for Br\u00f8ndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending [[Serie A]] champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] from Italy in June 1983. It was the biggest [[transfer deal]] in Danish football at the time, worth around $1&nbsp;million. He was due to sign for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, Liverpool proposed a four-year contract and Laudrup opted not to sign.<ref>[[#Kvist|Kvist]] (2001), p. 36</ref>\n\nUnder restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had Polish midfielder [[Zbigniew Boniek]] and [[Michel Platini]], Juventus initially lent Laudrup to newly promoted [[Rome]] club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for Juventus. With Lazio, he scored two goals in his Serie A debut, a 2\u20134 loss to [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]]. In his first year at Lazio, Lazio narrowly avoided [[relegation]], but as Juventus wanted to keep Boniek and Platini, he stayed for another year. Lazio started the [[1984\u201385 Serie A|1984\u201385 season]] poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to [[Serie B]]. Laudrup scored just one goal that season.\n\nLaudrup returned to Juventus in summer 1985 to replace Zbigniew Boniek, playing alongside Michel Platini. In his first year at the club, he won the [[1985\u201386 Serie A]] as well as the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/club/torphy-room/intercontinental-cup/coppa-intercontinentale-1985.php|title=Intercontinental Cup 1985|publisher=juventus.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/18/michel-platini-uefa-fifa-juventus|title=Michel Platini's playing brilliance can be seen through the murk|work=The Guardian|author1=Richard Williams|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjuve.it/season-1985-juventus/intercontinental_cup-juventus-argentinos_juniors-2-2-2617.aspx|title=Intercontinental Cup 1985|publisher=myjuve.it|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> he was once again named Danish Player of the Year in 1985. However, the following season was no success for Laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of Juventus players, including Platini. When Platini retired in 1987, Laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought Welsh forward [[Ian Rush]]. But Laudrup failed to live up to Platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the [[1987\u201388 Serie A|1987\u201388 season]].\n\n===Barcelona===\nAfter an unsuccessful season with Juventus, Laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in Italy. In 1989, he joined Spanish club [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on the premise that Netherlands legend [[Johan Cruyff]], his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. Immediately, Laudrup enjoyed major success under Cruyff's leadership, citing the Dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. He was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside Dutch defender [[Ronald Koeman]] and Bulgarian striker [[Hristo Stoichkov]], who were the pillars of the ''Bar\u00e7a'' \"[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]\", along with rising stars [[Pep Guardiola]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero]], and [[Txiki Begiristain]].\n\nThe Dream Team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] team, and won four consecutive [[La Liga]] championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]], along with the [[1992 UEFA Super Cup]], [[1989\u201390 Copa del Rey]] and [[1991 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a|1991]] and [[1992 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a|1992]] [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a]] titles. Laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in Spain during his Barcelona years. When ''Bar\u00e7a'' hired a fourth foreign star player, Brazilian striker [[Rom\u00e1rio]] in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 European Cup final 0\u20134 loss to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] (amid conflicts with Cruyff), his time at Barcelona was effectively over.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/21/michael-laudrup-portrait-of-an-icon-denmark-barcelona-real-madrid]</ref>\n\nLaudrup's departure from Barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Pep Guardiola was reportedly so upset by the news that he cried and begged Laudrup to change his mind.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, Laudrup commented, \"I think we played some very good football, and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with AC Milan in that period.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Sky Sports Special&nbsp;\u2013 Football's Greatest: Michael Laudrup.</ref>\n\n===Real Madrid===\nIn 1994, Laudrup completed a controversial move from ''Bar\u00e7a'' to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] after he fell-out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. It was the year before the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.\n\nDespite widespread belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in an attempt to \"get back\" at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona when he decided to join them. Laudrup said, \"People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at Barcelona]. I went to Madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup. I said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nLaudrup went on to guide Real Madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ''Bar\u00e7a'' stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the Spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. After the initial success at Real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Palle \"Banks\" J\u00f8rgensen, \"''Landsholdenes 2198 profiler''\", Danmark, 2004, {{ISBN|87-89564-04-9}}, p. 214</ref> While playing with Barcelona, he participated in the 5\u20130 victory over rivals Real Madrid in the 1993\u201394 season. The following season while playing for Real Madrid, he aided in the revenge beating Madrid gave ''Bar\u00e7a'', the final score also ending 5\u20130.

He was registered as a player in [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Premier League]] club [[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]] in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for \u010celik, but was signed as a player.<ref>[http://www.fyens.dk/article/90102:Sport--Laudrup-var-registreret-i-bosnisk-klub-SNYD--Det-hollandske-skattevaesen-foeler-sig-snydt-i-forbindelse-med-Michael-Laudrups-skifte-til-Ajax Laudrup var registreret i bosnisk klub SNYD: Det hollandske skattev\u0107sen f\u0159ler sig snydt i forbindelse med Michael Laudrups skifte til Ajax&nbsp;\u2013 fyens.dk&nbsp;\u2013 Sport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060142/http://www.fyens.dk/article/90102:Sport--Laudrup-var-registreret-i-bosnisk-klub-SNYD--Det-hollandske-skattevaesen-foeler-sig-snydt-i-forbindelse-med-Michael-Laudrups-skifte-til-Ajax |date=21 September 2013 }}. fyens.dk. 23 October 2004.</ref> After the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at Dutch side Ajax in 1998.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Laudrup sometimes turned out to play for [[Lyngby Boldklub|Lyngby]]'s Old Boys team in his spare time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120320215520/http://lyngby-boldklub.dk/Nyheder/Seneste_nyt/Trupperne_til_Oldboys_Landspokalfinalen/ Trupperne til Oldboys Landspokalfinalen]. lyngby-boldklub.dk. 13 October 2005</ref>\n\n==International career==\nLaudrup was called up for the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] during Br\u00f8ndby's debut season in the top-flight. On his 18th birthday on 15 June 1982, he became the then-second-youngest Danish national team player ever, following [[Harald Nielsen]]. Despite playing for relegation battlers Lazio, Laudrup starred for the Denmark national team at [[UEFA Euro 1984]], playing all four of Denmark's matches.\n\nLaudrup participated in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6\u20131 defeat of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He was also a part of the disappointing Denmark squad at [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], though Laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of Denmark's two goals.\n\nFollowing three matches in the qualification campaign for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 (alongside his brother Brian Laudrup and [[Jan M\u00f8lby]]) following differences with coach [[Richard M\u00f8ller Nielsen]].<ref>\"Historien om Michael Laudrups farvel\", ''[[Politiken]]'', 26 November 1990, Section:Sport, p.2</ref> The Danes originally failed to qualify but were later given [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]'s place as Yugoslavia were kicked out due to [[Yugoslav Wars|war in their country]]. Notwithstanding their qualification, Laudrup rated Denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as Denmark beat holders [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] surprisingly saving a [[Marco van Basten]] penalty in the shoot-out. In the [[UEFA Euro 1992 Final|final]] against world champions and favourites [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the Danes stunned the world with a 2\u20130 win thanks to goals from [[John Jensen]] and [[Kim Vilfort]], making it arguably the biggest surprise in a [[UEFA European Championship]] final.\n\nLaudrup returned to Nielsen's Danish squad in August 1993, but saw [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] ahead of Denmark. He scored a goal in the 2\u20130 victory against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], as Denmark won the [[1995 King Fahd Cup|1995 Intercontinental Cup]]. He also scored four goals in ten matches as Denmark qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]], though the tournament would leave no positives for him.\n\nLaudrup's last matches for Denmark came at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. Laudrup made his [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|100th appearance]] for Denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1\u20130 defeat of [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-06-14/sports/9806130177_1_michael-laudrup-world-cup-marc-rieper|title=Laudrup Celebrates Centennial Cap|date=14 June 1998|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Denmark was defeated 2\u20133 by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-finals, and both Michael and Brian Laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination.

The national team would play a [[4-2-3-1|4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation]], depending on two fast [[winger (football)|wingers]] and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. Together, they led Denmark to the knock-out stage of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]].\n\n===Br\u00f8ndby===\nAfter his success as Denmark assistant manager, Laudrup signed on as manager for [[Danish Superliga]] club Br\u00f8ndby. As his assistant coach, he paired up with former Danish championship winning manager [[John Jensen]], who had played alongside him in the Denmark national team. At the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which Olsen and he had coached at the national team. He renovated the Br\u00f8ndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.\n\n[[File:Michael Laudrup, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Laudrup as [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] manager]]\n\nTo ensure the defensive strength of the team, Laudrup signed proven national team player [[Morten Wieghorst]]. He began his reign as Br\u00f8ndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 [[Danish Supercup]]. In his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the [[2002\u201303 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]], after Br\u00f8ndby beat [[FC Midtjylland|Midtjylland]] 3\u20130 in the final and runners-up in the [[2002\u201303 Danish Superliga|Danish Superliga]]. Laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 Danish Superliga|following season]], he again finished the season runners-up to first place [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] by just one point. However, he would not be denied in the [[2004-05 in Danish football|2004\u201305 season]], where he finally led the team to the [[2004\u201305 Danish Superliga|Danish Superliga]] title. In the same season, he also completed [[Double (association football)|The Double]] after he won his second [[2004\u201305 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] in four seasons. This saw him being given his second Danish Manager of the Year award. After finishing runners-up in the [[2005\u201306 Danish Superliga]], Laudrup announced that he, along with assistant Faxe Jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. The pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left Br\u00f8ndby in June 2006.<ref>[http://origin.foxsports.news.com.au/story/0,8659,19225470-23210,00.html Laudrup leaving Brondby], [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], 22 May 2006</ref>\n\nLaudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club Real Madrid and that he would replace [[Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck]] as head coach of the [[Sweden national football team|Sweden national team]].\n\nIn 2007, Br\u00f8ndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium \"The Michael Laudrup Lounge\", with Laudrup's approval.

During his tenure as successor to [[Bernd Schuster]], he brought in a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to the club, bringing back memories of Laudrup as a player.

He went back to play for Br\u00f8ndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] of Br\u00f8ndby to the 1st Division.\n\nAt Br\u00f8ndby, Laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st Division debut game, as fellow promoted team [[Boldklubben 1909]] were beaten 7\u20131. He scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st Division. His accomplishments earned him the 1982 [[Danish Player of the Year]] award. He played part of the 1983 season for Br\u00f8ndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending [[Serie A]] champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] from Italy in June 1983. It was the biggest [[transfer deal]] in Danish football at the time, worth around $1&nbsp;million. He was due to sign for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, Liverpool proposed a four-year contract and Laudrup opted not to sign.<ref>[[#Kvist|Kvist]] (2001), p. 36</ref>\n\nUnder restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had Polish midfielder [[Zbigniew Boniek]] and [[Michel Platini]], Juventus initially lent Laudrup to newly promoted [[Rome]] club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for Juventus. With Lazio, he scored two goals in his Serie A debut, a 2\u20134 loss to [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]]. In his first year at Lazio, Lazio narrowly avoided [[relegation]], but as Juventus wanted to keep Boniek and Platini, he stayed for another year. Lazio started the [[1984\u201385 Serie A|1984\u201385 season]] poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to [[Serie B]]. Laudrup scored just one goal that season.\n\nLaudrup returned to Juventus in summer 1985 to replace Zbigniew Boniek, playing alongside Michel Platini. In his first year at the club, he won the [[1985\u201386 Serie A]] as well as the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/club/torphy-room/intercontinental-cup/coppa-intercontinentale-1985.php|title=Intercontinental Cup 1985|publisher=juventus.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/18/michel-platini-uefa-fifa-juventus|title=Michel Platini's playing brilliance can be seen through the murk|work=The Guardian|author1=Richard Williams|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjuve.it/season-1985-juventus/intercontinental_cup-juventus-argentinos_juniors-2-2-2617.aspx|title=Intercontinental Cup 1985|publisher=myjuve.it|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> he was once again named Danish Player of the Year in 1985. However, the following season was no success for Laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of Juventus players, including Platini. When Platini retired in 1987, Laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought Welsh forward [[Ian Rush]]. But Laudrup failed to live up to Platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the [[1987\u201388 Serie A|1987\u201388 season]].\n\n===Barcelona===\nAfter an unsuccessful season with Juventus, Laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in Italy. In 1989, he joined Spanish club [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on the premise that Netherlands legend [[Johan Cruyff]], his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. Immediately, Laudrup enjoyed major success under Cruyff's leadership, citing the Dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. He was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside Dutch defender [[Ronald Koeman]] and Bulgarian striker [[Hristo Stoichkov]], who were the pillars of the ''Bar\u00e7a'' \"[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]\", along with rising stars [[Pep Guardiola]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero]], and [[Txiki Begiristain]].\n\nThe Dream Team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] team, and won four consecutive [[La Liga]] championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]], along with the [[1992 UEFA Super Cup]], [[1989\u201390 Copa del Rey]] and [[1991 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a|1991]] and [[1992 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a|1992]] [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a]] titles. Laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in Spain during his Barcelona years. When ''Bar\u00e7a'' hired a fourth foreign star player, Brazilian striker [[Rom\u00e1rio]] in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 European Cup final 0\u20134 loss to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] (amid conflicts with Cruyff), his time at Barcelona was effectively over.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/21/michael-laudrup-portrait-of-an-icon-denmark-barcelona-real-madrid]</ref>\n\nLaudrup's departure from Barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Pep Guardiola was reportedly so upset by the news that he cried and begged Laudrup to change his mind.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, Laudrup commented, \"I think we played some very good football, and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with AC Milan in that period.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Sky Sports Special&nbsp;\u2013 Football's Greatest: Michael Laudrup.</ref>\n\n===Real Madrid===\nIn 1994, Laudrup completed a controversial move from ''Bar\u00e7a'' to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] after he fell-out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. It was the year before the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.\n\nDespite widespread belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in an attempt to \"get back\" at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona when he decided to join them. Laudrup said, \"People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at Barcelona]. I went to Madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup. I said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nLaudrup went on to guide Real Madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ''Bar\u00e7a'' stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the Spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. After the initial success at Real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Palle \"Banks\" J\u00f8rgensen, \"''Landsholdenes 2198 profiler''\", Danmark, 2004, {{ISBN|87-89564-04-9}}, p. 214</ref> While playing with Barcelona, he participated in the 5\u20130 victory over rivals Real Madrid in the 1993\u201394 season. The following season while playing for Real Madrid, he aided in the revenge beating Madrid gave ''Bar\u00e7a'', the final score also ending 5\u20130. [[Daniel Storey]] wrote of Laudrup,  \"no other player is loved on both sides of the cl\u00e1sico divide quite like Laudrup\" as he remains held in high regard by both Bar\u00e7a and Madrid fans.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\n===Later career and retirement===\nIn 1996, Laudrup left Real Madrid to play for [[Vissel Kobe]] in Japan, helping them to promotion from the [[Japan Football League (1992\u20131998)|second-tier Japan Football League]] to the [[J1 League]]. He was registered as a player in [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Premier League]] club [[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]] in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for \u010celik, but was signed as a player.<ref>[http://www.fyens.dk/article/90102:Sport--Laudrup-var-registreret-i-bosnisk-klub-SNYD--Det-hollandske-skattevaesen-foeler-sig-snydt-i-forbindelse-med-Michael-Laudrups-skifte-til-Ajax Laudrup var registreret i bosnisk klub SNYD: Det hollandske skattev\u0107sen f\u0159ler sig snydt i forbindelse med Michael Laudrups skifte til Ajax&nbsp;\u2013 fyens.dk&nbsp;\u2013 Sport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060142/http://www.fyens.dk/article/90102:Sport--Laudrup-var-registreret-i-bosnisk-klub-SNYD--Det-hollandske-skattevaesen-foeler-sig-snydt-i-forbindelse-med-Michael-Laudrups-skifte-til-Ajax |date=21 September 2013 }}. fyens.dk. 23 October 2004.</ref> After the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at Dutch side Ajax in 1998.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Laudrup sometimes turned out to play for [[Lyngby Boldklub|Lyngby]]'s Old Boys team in his spare time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120320215520/http://lyngby-boldklub.dk/Nyheder/Seneste_nyt/Trupperne_til_Oldboys_Landspokalfinalen/ Trupperne til Oldboys Landspokalfinalen]. lyngby-boldklub.dk. 13 October 2005</ref>\n\n==International career==\nLaudrup was called up for the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] during Br\u00f8ndby's debut season in the top-flight. On his 18th birthday on 15 June 1982, he became the then-second-youngest Danish national team player ever, following [[Harald Nielsen]]. Despite playing for relegation battlers Lazio, Laudrup starred for the Denmark national team at [[UEFA Euro 1984]], playing all four of Denmark's matches.\n\nLaudrup participated in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6\u20131 defeat of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He was also a part of the disappointing Denmark squad at [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], though Laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of Denmark's two goals.\n\nFollowing three matches in the qualification campaign for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 (alongside his brother Brian Laudrup and [[Jan M\u00f8lby]]) following differences with coach [[Richard M\u00f8ller Nielsen]].<ref>\"Historien om Michael Laudrups farvel\", ''[[Politiken]]'', 26 November 1990, Section:Sport, p.2</ref> The Danes originally failed to qualify but were later given [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]'s place as Yugoslavia were kicked out due to [[Yugoslav Wars|war in their country]]. Notwithstanding their qualification, Laudrup rated Denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as Denmark beat holders [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] surprisingly saving a [[Marco van Basten]] penalty in the shoot-out. In the [[UEFA Euro 1992 Final|final]] against world champions and favourites [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the Danes stunned the world with a 2\u20130 win thanks to goals from [[John Jensen]] and [[Kim Vilfort]], making it arguably the biggest surprise in a [[UEFA European Championship]] final.\n\nLaudrup returned to Nielsen's Danish squad in August 1993, but saw [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] ahead of Denmark. He scored a goal in the 2\u20130 victory against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], as Denmark won the [[1995 King Fahd Cup|1995 Intercontinental Cup]]. He also scored four goals in ten matches as Denmark qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]], though the tournament would leave no positives for him.\n\nLaudrup's last matches for Denmark came at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. Laudrup made his [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|100th appearance]] for Denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1\u20130 defeat of [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-06-14/sports/9806130177_1_michael-laudrup-world-cup-marc-rieper|title=Laudrup Celebrates Centennial Cap|date=14 June 1998|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Denmark was defeated 2\u20133 by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-finals, and both Michael and Brian Laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination.

Numerous teammates of his have said, \"Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball.\"\n\nIn Barcelona, Laudrup played alongside Hristo Stoichkov, who scored many goals from Laudrup's passes, like [[Iv\u00e1n Zamorano]] (who called Laudrup \"''El Genio''\" [\"The Genius\"]) during Laudrup's time at Real Madrid.

The national team would play a [[4-2-3-1|4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation]], depending on two fast [[winger (football)|wingers]] and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. Together, they led Denmark to the knock-out stage of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]].\n\n===Br\u00f8ndby===\nAfter his success as Denmark assistant manager, Laudrup signed on as manager for [[Danish Superliga]] club Br\u00f8ndby. As his assistant coach, he paired up with former Danish championship winning manager [[John Jensen]], who had played alongside him in the Denmark national team. At the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which Olsen and he had coached at the national team. He renovated the Br\u00f8ndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.\n\n[[File:Michael Laudrup, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Laudrup as [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] manager]]\n\nTo ensure the defensive strength of the team, Laudrup signed proven national team player [[Morten Wieghorst]]. He began his reign as Br\u00f8ndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 [[Danish Supercup]]. In his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the [[2002\u201303 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]], after Br\u00f8ndby beat [[FC Midtjylland|Midtjylland]] 3\u20130 in the final and runners-up in the [[2002\u201303 Danish Superliga|Danish Superliga]]. Laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 Danish Superliga|following season]], he again finished the season runners-up to first place [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] by just one point. However, he would not be denied in the [[2004-05 in Danish football|2004\u201305 season]], where he finally led the team to the [[2004\u201305 Danish Superliga|Danish Superliga]] title. In the same season, he also completed [[Double (association football)|The Double]] after he won his second [[2004\u201305 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] in four seasons. This saw him being given his second Danish Manager of the Year award. After finishing runners-up in the [[2005\u201306 Danish Superliga]], Laudrup announced that he, along with assistant Faxe Jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. The pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left Br\u00f8ndby in June 2006.<ref>[http://origin.foxsports.news.com.au/story/0,8659,19225470-23210,00.html Laudrup leaving Brondby], [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], 22 May 2006</ref>\n\nLaudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club Real Madrid and that he would replace [[Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck]] as head coach of the [[Sweden national football team|Sweden national team]].\n\nIn 2007, Br\u00f8ndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium \"The Michael Laudrup Lounge\", with Laudrup's approval.

During his tenure as successor to [[Bernd Schuster]], he brought in a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to the club, bringing back memories of Laudrup as a player.

For example, the carbon-fibre rear diffuser that guides airflow from under the car creating down-force, and includes an active aerofoil and is lowered automatically as speed increases.

In order to create a lightweight strong structure, the chassis was planned to be made of [[carbon-fibre]], and the engine was to be mid-mounted for optimum weight distribution and to retain the concept's silhouette. The C-X75 production version was expected to deliver {{CO2}} emissions of less than 99 g/km, a sub-three second 0\u201360&nbsp;mph acceleration time, a top speed in excess of {{Convert|200|mph}} and a reduced [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|50|km|abbr=in|0}} as compared to the {{Convert|110|km|abbr=in|0}} for the concept car.<ref name=GCC050611/>\n\n==Cancellation==\nIn December 2012, Jaguar's Global Brand Director announced the cancellation of production due to the [[2008\u20132012 global recession|ongoing global economic crisis]], as the carmaker considered that \"'' it seems the wrong time to launch an \u00a3800,000 to \u00a31 million supercar''.\"  The company expected to take advantage of part of the investment in the C-X75 development by using the C-X75 technology in future Jaguar cars. The [[Jaguar F-type]] was heavily influenced from the C-X75 and carried over many design cues and technological features from it. Jaguar announced its decision to continue working on five prototypes to be developed until May 2013. These prototypes featured a 1.6-litre [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] and [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[inline-4|inline-4 engine]] coupled with two YASA electric motors placed on each axle of the car. The powertrain had a combined power output of {{cvt|890|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 9,000 rpm and helped the car achieve speeds up to {{cvt|200|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. Up to three of these prototypes were then sold at auction, while one went to a future Jaguar museum, and one was kept by Jaguar for running demonstrations. One of these prototypes was also featured in the 2015 James Bond film, Spectre.<ref name=CX75cancel/>\n\n==Appearance in ''Spectre''==\n[[File:GLOBAL UNVEILING OF JAGUAR LAND ROVER BOND CARS (21270366798).jpg |thumb |One of the Seven C-X75s used in the film ''Spectre'']]\n\nA Jaguar C-X75 appears in the 2015 James Bond film [[Spectre (2015 film)|''Spectre'']] as Mr. Hinx's car.

The [[Jaguar F-type]] was heavily influenced from the C-X75 and carried over many design cues and technological features from it. Jaguar announced its decision to continue working on five prototypes to be developed until May 2013. These prototypes featured a 1.6-litre [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] and [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[inline-4|inline-4 engine]] coupled with two YASA electric motors placed on each axle of the car. The powertrain had a combined power output of {{cvt|890|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 9,000 rpm and helped the car achieve speeds up to {{cvt|200|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}}. Up to three of these prototypes were then sold at auction, while one went to a future Jaguar museum, and one was kept by Jaguar for running demonstrations. One of these prototypes was also featured in the 2015 James Bond film, Spectre.<ref name=CX75cancel/>\n\n==Appearance in ''Spectre''==\n[[File:GLOBAL UNVEILING OF JAGUAR LAND ROVER BOND CARS (21270366798).jpg |thumb |One of the Seven C-X75s used in the film ''Spectre'']]\n\nA Jaguar C-X75 appears in the 2015 James Bond film [[Spectre (2015 film)|''Spectre'']] as Mr. Hinx's car.

Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, as well as [[feeling]] and [[thought]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] group of researchers. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<ref name=\"Fernald\">Fernald LD (2008).

Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name =\"reference_name_A\">Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables.

This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin\u2013yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611\u20131671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660\u20131730), and Wang Qingren (1768\u20131831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, \"China\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\nDistinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by [[Hinduism]]. A central idea of the [[Upanishads]] is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|eternal unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit corpus]] was suppressed under the [[British East India Company]] followed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the [[Theosophical Society]], a [[New Age]] group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, \"From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India\", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref>\n\nPsychology was a popular topic in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum\u2014most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia rationalis'' in 1734. This notion advanced further under [[Immanuel Kant]], who established the idea of [[History of anthropology|anthropology]], with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of [[experimental psychology]], writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Old University of M\u00fcnster was discontinued by Prussian authorities.<ref>Schwarz, K.

It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[psychological repression|repression]], and the unconscious. These subjects were largely taboo at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for their open discussion in polite society.<ref name=Kozulin1984Pages84to86 /> Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] and a therapeutic interest in [[dream interpretation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Freud, S|year=1900|title=The Interpretation of Dreams|journal=|edition= 2nd|publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955|volume=IV and V|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Freud, S |title=The Unconscious |year=1915 |edition= 2nd |volume=XIV |publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955}}</ref>\n\nSwiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, influenced by Freud, elaborated a theory of the [[collective unconscious]]\u2014a primordial force present in all humans, featuring [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] which exerted a profound influence on the mind.

Cognitive psychologists have used a \"filter\" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]'' of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999 /> A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between ''[[implicit memory|implicit]]'' and ''[[explicit memory|explicit]]'' memory. In another approach, one can also describe a [[subliminal stimulus]] as meeting an ''objective'' but not a ''subjective'' threshold.<ref name=BanksFarber>William P.

With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<ref name=ForgasEtAl>Forgas, Williams, & Laham, \"Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview\", in Forgas, Williams, & Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).</ref> According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation\" (pp. 9\u201384).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P. Godsil, Matthew R. Tinsley, & Michael S. Fanselow, \"Motivation\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 4: ''Experimental Psychology''.</ref> [[Clark Hull]] formalized the latter idea with his [[Drive reduction theory (learning theory)|drive reduction]] model.<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 3, \"Drive Theory\" (pp. 85\u2013138).</ref>\n\nHunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation all seem to constitute fundamental motivations for animals.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Humans also seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations\u2014though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from primordial instincts\u2014including desires for belonging, self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and control.<ref>[[E. Tory Higgins]], ''Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works''; Oxford University Press, 2012; {{ISBN|978-0-19-976582-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref><ref>Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008), entire volume.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nMotivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. Researchers have found that [[eating]], for example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for [[homeostasis]]\u2014an important factor causing the experience of hunger\u2014but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost.<ref name=GodsilEtAl /> Abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as ''goal contagion'': the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.<ref>Hank Aarts, Ap Dijksterhuis, & Giel Dik, \"Goal Contagion: Inferring goals from others' actions\u2014and what it leads to\", in Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008). \"In short, then, the studies presented above indicate that humans are keen to act on the goals of other social beings that are implied in behavioral scenarios or scripts.\" Also see: {{cite journal | last1 = Aarts | last2 = Hassin | last3 = Gollwitzer | title = Goal Contagion: Perceiving is for Pursuing | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 1| year = 2004 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.1.23 | pages=23\u201337 | pmid=15250790| citeseerx = 10.1.1.312.5507 }}</ref> Vohs and [[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]] suggest that contrary to the need-desire-fulfilment cycle of animal instincts, human motivations sometimes obey a \"getting begets wanting\" rule: the more you get a reward such as self-esteem, love, drugs, or money, the more you want it. They suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and sleep.<ref>Kathleen D. Vohs & [[Roy F. Baumeister]], \"Can Satisfaction Reinforce Wanting?

This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Genes and environment ===\n{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}\n\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702\u2013709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160\u2013164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental [[behavioral genetic]] research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name=\"Behavior Genetics\" /> Traditionally this research has been conducted using [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly [[polygenic]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.029 |pmid=22243964 |pmc=3257326 |title=Five Years of GWAS Discovery |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201324 |year=2012 |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter\u00a0M. |last2=Brown |first2=Matthew\u00a0A. |last3=McCarthy |first3=Mark\u00a0I. |last4=Yang |first4=Jian }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature13595 |pmid=25056061 |pmc=4112379 |title=Biological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci |journal=Nature |volume=511 |issue=7510 |pages=421\u2013427 |year=2014 |bibcode=2014Natur.511..421S |last1=Ripke |first1=Stephan |last2=Neale |first2=Benjamin M. |last3=Corvin |first3=Aiden |last4=Walters |first4=James T.

Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]\u2014judgment of character based on the face\u2014described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nWhen experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as ''[[psychometrics]]'').<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term \"mental test\".<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 45\u201346.</ref> In 1901, Cattell's student [[Clark Wissler]] published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance.<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46 /> In response to 1904 orders from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]], French psychologists [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Simon]] elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905\u20131911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H. Goddard]] put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as ''imbecile'' and ''feebleminded''. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford\u2013Binet scale]]) and introduced the [[intelligence quotient]] as a score report.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 50\u201356.</ref> From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation \"represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes.

Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of ''[[professional psychology]]''. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or [[mental illness]] and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name=\"brain\">Brain, Christine.

For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is [[transference]], in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, \"Psychodynamic Psychotherapy\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nPsychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]] and [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, \"Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nMental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram Brown (physician)|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of \"intense competition and role confusion\".<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, \"The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900\u20131980s\", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PhD or PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. This degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.<ref name=HallHurley />\n\nSome clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury\u2014this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, \"Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office\u2014Get into the Field!\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition.\"</ref>\n\nThe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential\u2013humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223\u20131233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377\u2013400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124\u2013130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

The work of child psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nSchool psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments.

With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist [[Elton Mayo]], Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term [[Hawthorne effect]] is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.<ref>Yeh Hsueh, \"The Hawthorne experiments and the introduction of Jean Piaget in American industrial psychology, 1929\u20131932\"; ''History of Psychology'' 5.2, May 2002.</ref>\n\nThe name industrial and organizational psychology (I\u2013O) arose in the 1960s and became enshrined as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]], Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, in 1973.<ref name=Koppes /> The goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I\u2013O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers.

In the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia|Fort Oglethorpe]] in Georgia, to provide psychological training for military staff military.<ref name=Tomes2008 /><ref>[[Robert M.

A prominent aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.<ref>Marilu Price Berry, \"Interdisciplinary Medical Setting: The Multiple Roles of a Health Psychologist\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005).</ref>\n\nPsychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies.

Baskin, \"Public Health: Career Opportunities for Psychologists in Public Health\", in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001).\"</ref>\n\nBlack American psychologists [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v.

In 2010, ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[gratitude journal]]ing and the physical expression of gratitude. Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their effects are thought to be superior to that of [[placebo]]s, especially with regard to helping people with body image problems.\n\n== Research methods ==\n{{Main|Psychological research|List of psychological research methods}}\n\n[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data.<ref>John A. Schinka & Wayne F. Velicer, \"Volume Preface\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> These include the [[Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficient]], the [[analysis of variance]], [[multiple linear regression]], [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[hierarchical linear modeling]].

In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n[[Repeated-measures experiment]]s are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable. The dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.<ref>Evelyn S. Behar & Thomas D. Borkovec, \"Psychotherapy Outcome Research\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> Using [[crossover study|crossover design]], researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.\n\n[[Quasi-experimental design]] refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, \"Program Evaluation\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.\n\nExperimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific [[hypothesis]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the [[null hypothesis]] that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely used standard ascribes [[statistical significance]] to results which have less than 5% [[p-value|probability of being explained by random variation]].<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], \"Experimental Design\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Other forms of statistical inference ===\n[[Statistical survey]]s are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n[[Neuropsychological tests]], such as the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler scales]] and [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. These can be used in experiments, as in the case of [[lesion]] experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.<ref>Russell M. Bauer, Elizabeth C. Leritz, & Dawn Bowers, \"Neuropsychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n[[Observational studies]] analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; [[multivariate statistics]] are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. [[Cross-sectional studies|Cross-sectional]] observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas [[longitudinal studies|longitudinal]] studies are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as ''selective attrition'' (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).\n\n[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]], or hypothesis formation.<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.<ref>Frank L.

[[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the [[delta wave]] observed during non-REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = R\u00f6sler | first1 = Frank | title = From Single-Channel Recordings to Brain-Mapping Devices: The Impact of Electroencephalography on Experimental Psychology | url = http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| year = 2005 | doi=10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.95 | pmid = 16021767 | pages=95\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nNewer [[functional neuroimaging]] techniques include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]], both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate\u2014or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic [[neural network]] model rather than a localized function model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Joseph M. | last2 = Zaki | first2 = Jamil | title = Functional Neuroimaging and Psychology: What Have You Done for Me Lately? | url = http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518| journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 6| year = 2013 | doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00380 | pages=834\u2013842 | pmid=23469884}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Berntson | first2 = Gary G. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = Howard C. | title = Neuroimaging as a New Tool in the Toolbox of Psychological Science | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00550.x | pages = 62\u201367 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031185051/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | archivedate = 31 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aue | first1 = Tatjana | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = Leah A. | last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = John T. | title = Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena? | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.12.017 | pages = 10\u201316 | pmid = 19232374 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109084331/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | archivedate = 9 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPsychiatric interventions such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and drugs also provide information about brain\u2013mind interactions. [[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\n\n[[File:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]\n\n=== Computer simulation ===\n{{See also|Computational cognition}}\nComputational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.\n\n=== Animal studies ===\n[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]\n\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |accessdate= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\n\n=== Qualitative and descriptive research ===\nResearch designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as ''descriptive research''. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. ''Qualitative research'' is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.\n\n[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or [[critical theory|critiques]] of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--> or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].\n\n[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P.

Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\n\n===Program Evaluation===\n[[Program Evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Criticism}}Contemporary issues in methodology and practice ==\n=== Metascience ===\nThe field of [[metascience]] has revealed significant problems with the methodology of psychological research.

Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]).\n\nThe most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.\n\n=== Humans ===\nUniversity psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>\n\nThe ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as \"Ethical Standards of Psychologists\". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, \"Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nSome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.<ref name=HandbookJones />\n\n=== Other animals ===\nCurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291\u2013305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n* An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants.

Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, as well as [[feeling]] and [[thought]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] group of researchers. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<ref name=\"Fernald\">Fernald LD (2008).

Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and [[social behavior]], while also exploring the [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[neurobiology|biological]] processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\n\n<!--Subjects and methods:-->\nPsychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|subjective experiences]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], and [[personality psychology|personality]]. This extends to interaction between people, such as [[interpersonal relationship]]s, including [[psychological resilience]], [[family resilience]], and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name =\"reference_name_A\">Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In [[eclecticism|addition]], or in [[antipositivism|opposition]], to employing empirical and deductive methods, some\u2014especially [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[counseling psychology|counseling]] psychologists\u2014at times rely upon [[Hermeneutics#Psychology|symbolic interpretation]] and other [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] techniques.

This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin\u2013yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611\u20131671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660\u20131730), and Wang Qingren (1768\u20131831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, \"China\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\nDistinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by [[Hinduism]]. A central idea of the [[Upanishads]] is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|eternal unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit corpus]] was suppressed under the [[British East India Company]] followed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the [[Theosophical Society]], a [[New Age]] group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, \"From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India\", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref>\n\nPsychology was a popular topic in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum\u2014most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia rationalis'' in 1734. This notion advanced further under [[Immanuel Kant]], who established the idea of [[History of anthropology|anthropology]], with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of [[experimental psychology]], writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Old University of M\u00fcnster was discontinued by Prussian authorities.<ref>Schwarz, K.

Chinese psychologists elaborated on Lenin's model of a \"reflective\" consciousness, envisioning an \"active consciousness\" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=tzu-chueh neng-tung-li}}) able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle. They developed a concept of \"recognition\" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=jen-shih}}) which referred the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview (failure to correspond with party doctrine was \"incorrect recognition\").<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 9\u201317. \"The Soviet psychology that Peking modeled itself upon was a Marxist-Leninist psychology with a philosophical base in dialectical materialism and a newly added label, Pavlovianism. This new Soviet psychology leaned heavily on Lenin's theory of reflection, which was unearthed in his two volumes posthumously published in 1924. Toward the late twenties, a group of Soviet research psychologists headed by Vygotskii, along with Luria and Leont'ev, laid the groundwork for a Marxist-Leninist approach to psychic development.\"</ref> Psychology education was centralized under the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], supervised by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. In 1951, the Academy created a Psychology Research Office, which in 1956 became the Institute of Psychology.

Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation\" (pp. 9\u201384).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P.

Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Genes and environment ===\n{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}\n\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702\u2013709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160\u2013164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental [[behavioral genetic]] research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name=\"Behavior Genetics\" /> Traditionally this research has been conducted using [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype.

Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]\u2014judgment of character based on the face\u2014described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nWhen experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as ''[[psychometrics]]'').<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term \"mental test\".<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 45\u201346.</ref> In 1901, Cattell's student [[Clark Wissler]] published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance.<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46 /> In response to 1904 orders from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]], French psychologists [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Simon]] elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905\u20131911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H. Goddard]] put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as ''imbecile'' and ''feebleminded''. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford\u2013Binet scale]]) and introduced the [[intelligence quotient]] as a score report.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 50\u201356.</ref> From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation \"represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes.

Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of ''[[professional psychology]]''. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or [[mental illness]] and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name=\"brain\">Brain, Christine.

Another modern psychotherapist was [[Morton Prince]].<ref name=StrickerWidiger>George Stricker & Thomas A. Widiger, \"Volume Preface\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> For the most part, in the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is [[transference]], in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, \"Psychodynamic Psychotherapy\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nPsychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]] and [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, \"Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nMental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram Brown (physician)|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of \"intense competition and role confusion\".<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, \"The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900\u20131980s\", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PhD or PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. This degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.<ref name=HallHurley />\n\nSome clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury\u2014this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, \"Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office\u2014Get into the Field!\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition.\"</ref>\n\nThe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential\u2013humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223\u20131233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377\u2013400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124\u2013130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

(ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001).\"</ref>\n\nBlack American psychologists [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v.

In 2010, ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[gratitude journal]]ing and the physical expression of gratitude. Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their effects are thought to be superior to that of [[placebo]]s, especially with regard to helping people with body image problems.\n\n== Research methods ==\n{{Main|Psychological research|List of psychological research methods}}\n\n[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data.<ref>John A. Schinka & Wayne F. Velicer, \"Volume Preface\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> These include the [[Pearson product\u2013moment correlation coefficient]], the [[analysis of variance]], [[multiple linear regression]], [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[hierarchical linear modeling]].

In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n[[Repeated-measures experiment]]s are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable. The dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.<ref>Evelyn S. Behar & Thomas D. Borkovec, \"Psychotherapy Outcome Research\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> Using [[crossover study|crossover design]], researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.\n\n[[Quasi-experimental design]] refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, \"Program Evaluation\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.\n\nExperimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific [[hypothesis]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the [[null hypothesis]] that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely used standard ascribes [[statistical significance]] to results which have less than 5% [[p-value|probability of being explained by random variation]].<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], \"Experimental Design\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Other forms of statistical inference ===\n[[Statistical survey]]s are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n[[Neuropsychological tests]], such as the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler scales]] and [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. These can be used in experiments, as in the case of [[lesion]] experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.<ref>Russell M. Bauer, Elizabeth C. Leritz, & Dawn Bowers, \"Neuropsychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n[[Observational studies]] analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; [[multivariate statistics]] are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. [[Cross-sectional studies|Cross-sectional]] observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas [[longitudinal studies|longitudinal]] studies are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as ''selective attrition'' (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).\n\n[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]], or hypothesis formation.<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.<ref>Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, \"Meta-Analysis\", ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Technological assays ===\n[[File:EEG cap.jpg|alt=|thumb|An EEG recording setup]]\nA classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain. [[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the [[delta wave]] observed during non-REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = R\u00f6sler | first1 = Frank | title = From Single-Channel Recordings to Brain-Mapping Devices: The Impact of Electroencephalography on Experimental Psychology | url = http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| year = 2005 | doi=10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.95 | pmid = 16021767 | pages=95\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nNewer [[functional neuroimaging]] techniques include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]], both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate\u2014or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic [[neural network]] model rather than a localized function model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Joseph M. | last2 = Zaki | first2 = Jamil | title = Functional Neuroimaging and Psychology: What Have You Done for Me Lately? | url = http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518| journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 6| year = 2013 | doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00380 | pages=834\u2013842 | pmid=23469884}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Berntson | first2 = Gary G. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = Howard C. | title = Neuroimaging as a New Tool in the Toolbox of Psychological Science | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00550.x | pages = 62\u201367 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031185051/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | archivedate = 31 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aue | first1 = Tatjana | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = Leah A. | last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = John T. | title = Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena? | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.12.017 | pages = 10\u201316 | pmid = 19232374 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109084331/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | archivedate = 9 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPsychiatric interventions such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and drugs also provide information about brain\u2013mind interactions. [[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\n\n[[File:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]\n\n=== Computer simulation ===\n{{See also|Computational cognition}}\nComputational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.\n\n=== Animal studies ===\n[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]\n\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |accessdate= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\n\n=== Qualitative and descriptive research ===\nResearch designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as ''descriptive research''. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. ''Qualitative research'' is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.\n\n[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or [[critical theory|critiques]] of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--> or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].\n\n[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P.

Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\n\n===Program Evaluation===\n[[Program Evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Criticism}}Contemporary issues in methodology and practice ==\n=== Metascience ===\nThe field of [[metascience]] has revealed significant problems with the methodology of psychological research.

Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]).\n\nThe most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.\n\n=== Humans ===\nUniversity psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>\n\nThe ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as \"Ethical Standards of Psychologists\". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, \"Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nSome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.<ref name=HandbookJones />\n\n=== Other animals ===\nCurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291\u2013305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n* An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants.

Irvin Solomon notes that Fort Myers was described \"as 'one of the finest and largest' forts of the Seminole Wars\".

It was intended as a place from which to recruit Union sympathizers and Confederate [[Confederate States Army#Desertion|deserters]] and [[Confederate States of America#Conscription|conscription-evaders]] and to raid into the interior and interfere with Confederate efforts to round up cattle for supply to the Confederate Army. After some probes along the [[Peace River|Peace]] and [[Myakka River|Myakka]] rivers, which had mixed results, operations were moved to the mainland.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|pp=317\u201319, 324\u201325}} Troops from the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment]] and the 2nd Regiment of Florida Rangers (later reorganized as the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)]]) left [[Key West]] for Fort Myers early in January 1864. The Union soldiers reached Fort Myers quickly enough to capture three Confederate sympathizers before they could act on orders to burn the fort to keep it out of Union hands. Beyond the principal reason for occupying the fort of providing support for Union sympathizers and local residents disaffected with Confederate taxation and conscription, the fort provided access to the large cattle herds in southern Florida, support for the blockade of the southwest Florida coast being conducted by the U.S. Navy, and a haven for any escaped slaves in the area.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133, 134, 136}}\n\nIn April 1864, after the troops from the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment had been transferred to Louisiana, Companies D and I of the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]] were transferred from Key West to Fort Myers, and remained at the fort until it was abandoned.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334}} Company G of the regiment had also been sent to Fort Myers by early May. {{sfn|Buker|1993|p=139}} Solomon argues that [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] Brigadier General [[Daniel Phineas Woodbury]], commandant of the District of Key West and the Tortugas, intended that action to be an irritant to the Confederacy. The presence of the black soldiers, who made up the majority of troops used in raids into Confederate territory, played on Confederate fears of armed blacks. It was reported that Woodbury took pleasure in placing a \"prickly pear cactus under the Confederate saddle\".{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334, 143}}\n\nBy the spring of 1864, Fort Myers was protected by a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]], {{convert|7|ft}} high and {{convert|15|ft}} wide, extending in an arc around the land side of the fort. The Seminole War-era blockhouse had been repaired and another two-story blockhouse built. The fort was soon harboring more than 400 civilians and Confederate army deserters. Many of the white men enlisted in the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)|2nd Florida Union Cavalry]]. Although designated as cavalry, the members of the regiment stationed at Fort Myers were never mounted. Escaped slaves that came to the fort were recruited into the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=136\u201337, 160}}\n\nThe Union achieved control of the full length of the Mississippi River after the [[Siege of Vicksburg|fall of Vicksburg]] in July 1863. The Confederate Army then became dependent on Florida for most of its supply of beef. By the end of 1863 between 1,000 and 2,000 head of cattle were being shipped to the Confederate Army from Florida every week.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=140\u2013141}} As 1864 progressed, Union troops and sympathizers began driving cattle to Punta Rassa to supply Union ships on blockade duty and Union-held Key West, reducing the supply of cattle available to Confederate forces. The increased shipping from Punta Rassa led the Union Army to built a barracks and a wharf there.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|p=329}} By one Confederate estimate, the Union shipped 4,500 head of cattle from Punta Rassa.{{sfn|Buker|1993|p=160}}\n\nThe '''[[Battle of Fort Myers]]''' was fought on February 20, 1865, in [[Lee County, Florida]] during the last months of the American Civil War.

He traded tobacco, beads, and gunpowder, and sold otter, bobcat, and gator hide to the neighboring Seminole.<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/> A small community began to form around the trading post.\n\nIn the late 19th century, northerners began to travel to Florida in the winter. Some saw development opportunities. In 1881, the wealthy industrialist [[Hamilton Disston]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] came to the Caloosahatchee Valley. He planned to dredge and drain the [[Everglades]] for development. Diston connected [[Lake Okeechobee]] with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the [[Kissimmee River]].<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/>\n\nOn August 12, 1885, the small town of Fort Myers&mdash;all 349 residents&mdash;was incorporated. At that time, it was the second-largest town on Florida's Gulf Coast south of [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=https://fortmyers.org/live-in-fort-myers/history-of-fort-myers/|title=The History of Fort Myers - Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce|website=Fortmyers.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1885, inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]] was cruising Florida's west coast and stopped to visit Fort Myers.<ref name=\"history\"/> He soon bought 13 acres along the Caloosahatchee River in town. There he built his home \"Seminole Lodge\", as a winter retreat. It included a laboratory for his continuing work. After the lodge was completed in 1886, Edison and his wife, Mina, spent many winters in Fort Myers. Edison also enjoyed local recreational fishing, for which Fort Myers had gained a national reputation.<ref name=\"myriver\">{{cite web|url=http://www.myriverdistrict.com/p/about/212|title=History of Ft Myers|website=Myriverdistrict.com|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the Royal Palm Hotel was constructed. This luxury hotel attracted tourists and established Fort Myers nationally as a winter resort destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/photos/business/hotels/0965.htm|title=Royal Palm Hotel in Fort Myers|first=Florida Center for Instructional|last=Technology|website=Fcit.usf.edu|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nOn May 10, 1904, access to the Fort Myers area was greatly improved with the opening of the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]], connecting [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]] to Fort Myers. This route provided Lee County both passenger and freight railroad service.<ref>Turner, Gregg M. ''A Journey Into Florida Railroad History''. University Press of Florida, p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3233-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the Arcade Theater was constructed in downtown Fort Myers. Originally a vaudeville house, Edison viewed films here for the first time with friends [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/10390|title=Arcade Theater in Fort Myers, FL - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> With the growth of the film industry, the Arcade Theatre was converted into a full movie house. A wall divided the stage in order to form two screening rooms. Changes in moviegoing habits since the late 20th century have led to the renovation of the theater for use again in live performance. It is now host to the Florida Repertory Theatre, a performing arts hall.\n\nDuring World War I, Edison became concerned about America's reliance on foreign supplies of rubber. He partnered with tire producer Harvey Firestone, of the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], and Henry Ford, of the [[Ford Motor Company]], to try to find a rubber tree or plant that could grow quickly in the United States. He sought one that would contain enough latex to support his research endeavor. In 1927, the three men contributed $25,000 each, and created the Edison Botanic Research Corporation in an attempt to find a solution to this problem.<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1928, the Edison Botanic Research Corporation laboratory was constructed. It was in Fort Myers that Edison conducted the majority of his research and planted exotic plants and trees. He sent results and sample rubber  residues to [[West Orange, New Jersey]], for further work at his large Thomas A. Edison \"Invention Factory\" (now preserved in the [[Thomas Edison National Historical Park]]). Through Edison's efforts, the [[Roystonea regia|royal palms]] lining Riverside Avenue (now McGregor Boulevard) were imported and planted. They inspired Fort Myers' nickname as \"City of Palms\".<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAfter testing 17,000 plant samples, Edison eventually discovered a source in the plant [[Goldenrod]] (Solidago leavenworthii). The rubber project was transferred to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] five years later.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n[[Image:Fordwinterhome2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Mangoes: Henry Ford's winter home]]\nIn 1916, automobile magnate Ford purchased the home next to Edison's from Robert Smith of New York. Ford named his estate \"the Mangoes\". Ford's craftsman-style \"bungalow\" was built in 1911 by Smith. Ford, Firestone, and Edison were leaders in American industry and part of an exclusive group titled \"the Millionaires' Club\". The three men have been memorialized in statues in downtown Fort Myers' Centennial Park.\n\nIn 1924, with the beginning of construction of the [[Edison Bridge (Florida)|Edison Bridge]], named for Edison, the city's population steadily grew. The bridge was opened on February 11, 1931, the 84th birthday of its namesake. Edison dedicated the bridge, and was the first to drive across it.\n\n[[File:Fort Myers FL Downtown HD Kress bldg01.jpg|thumb|Architecture of Downtown Fort Myers]]\nIn the decade following the bridge's construction, the city had a real estate boom. Several new residential subdivisions were built beyond downtown, including Dean Park, Edison Park, and Seminole Park.<ref name=\"myriver\"/> Edison Park, located across McGregor Boulevard from the Edison and Ford properties, includes a number of Fort Myers' most stately homes. The historic development showcases a variety of architectural styles. In the 21st century, it is known for its community activities and strong neighborhood ties.<ref>[http://www.fortmyers-online.com/mcgregor-history.htm McGregor history], Fort Myers Online</ref>\n\nIn 1947, Mina Edison deeded Seminole Lodge to the city of Fort Myers, in memory of her late husband and for the enjoyment of the public. By 1988, the adjacent Henry Ford winter estate was purchased by the city and opened for public tours in 1990. The combined properties today are known as the [[Edison and Ford Winter Estates]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|40.4|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|31.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.6|sqmi}} (21.25%) is water.\n\nFort Myers is on the border between a [[tropical savanna climate]] and a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Randolph J.

It was intended as a place from which to recruit Union sympathizers and Confederate [[Confederate States Army#Desertion|deserters]] and [[Confederate States of America#Conscription|conscription-evaders]] and to raid into the interior and interfere with Confederate efforts to round up cattle for supply to the Confederate Army. After some probes along the [[Peace River|Peace]] and [[Myakka River|Myakka]] rivers, which had mixed results, operations were moved to the mainland.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|pp=317\u201319, 324\u201325}} Troops from the [[47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment]] and the 2nd Regiment of Florida Rangers (later reorganized as the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)]]) left [[Key West]] for Fort Myers early in January 1864. The Union soldiers reached Fort Myers quickly enough to capture three Confederate sympathizers before they could act on orders to burn the fort to keep it out of Union hands. Beyond the principal reason for occupying the fort of providing support for Union sympathizers and local residents disaffected with Confederate taxation and conscription, the fort provided access to the large cattle herds in southern Florida, support for the blockade of the southwest Florida coast being conducted by the U.S. Navy, and a haven for any escaped slaves in the area.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133, 134, 136}}\n\nIn April 1864, after the troops from the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment had been transferred to Louisiana, Companies D and I of the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]] were transferred from Key West to Fort Myers, and remained at the fort until it was abandoned.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334}} Company G of the regiment had also been sent to Fort Myers by early May. {{sfn|Buker|1993|p=139}} Solomon argues that [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] Brigadier General [[Daniel Phineas Woodbury]], commandant of the District of Key West and the Tortugas, intended that action to be an irritant to the Confederacy. The presence of the black soldiers, who made up the majority of troops used in raids into Confederate territory, played on Confederate fears of armed blacks. It was reported that Woodbury took pleasure in placing a \"prickly pear cactus under the Confederate saddle\".{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=133\u201334, 143}}\n\nBy the spring of 1864, Fort Myers was protected by a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]], {{convert|7|ft}} high and {{convert|15|ft}} wide, extending in an arc around the land side of the fort. The Seminole War-era blockhouse had been repaired and another two-story blockhouse built. The fort was soon harboring more than 400 civilians and Confederate army deserters. Many of the white men enlisted in the [[2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment (Union)|2nd Florida Union Cavalry]]. Although designated as cavalry, the members of the regiment stationed at Fort Myers were never mounted. Escaped slaves that came to the fort were recruited into the [[2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=136\u201337, 160}}\n\nThe Union achieved control of the full length of the Mississippi River after the [[Siege of Vicksburg|fall of Vicksburg]] in July 1863. The Confederate Army then became dependent on Florida for most of its supply of beef. By the end of 1863 between 1,000 and 2,000 head of cattle were being shipped to the Confederate Army from Florida every week.{{sfn|Solomon|1993|pp=140\u2013141}} As 1864 progressed, Union troops and sympathizers began driving cattle to Punta Rassa to supply Union ships on blockade duty and Union-held Key West, reducing the supply of cattle available to Confederate forces. The increased shipping from Punta Rassa led the Union Army to built a barracks and a wharf there.{{sfn|Dillon|1984|p=329}} By one Confederate estimate, the Union shipped 4,500 head of cattle from Punta Rassa.{{sfn|Buker|1993|p=160}}\n\nThe '''[[Battle of Fort Myers]]''' was fought on February 20, 1865, in [[Lee County, Florida]] during the last months of the American Civil War.

He traded tobacco, beads, and gunpowder, and sold otter, bobcat, and gator hide to the neighboring Seminole.<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/> A small community began to form around the trading post.\n\nIn the late 19th century, northerners began to travel to Florida in the winter. Some saw development opportunities. In 1881, the wealthy industrialist [[Hamilton Disston]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] came to the Caloosahatchee Valley. He planned to dredge and drain the [[Everglades]] for development. Diston connected [[Lake Okeechobee]] with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the [[Kissimmee River]].<ref name=\"fortmyers-online.com\"/>\n\nOn August 12, 1885, the small town of Fort Myers&mdash;all 349 residents&mdash;was incorporated. At that time, it was the second-largest town on Florida's Gulf Coast south of [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=https://fortmyers.org/live-in-fort-myers/history-of-fort-myers/|title=The History of Fort Myers - Greater Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce|website=Fortmyers.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1885, inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]] was cruising Florida's west coast and stopped to visit Fort Myers.<ref name=\"history\"/> He soon bought 13 acres along the Caloosahatchee River in town. There he built his home \"Seminole Lodge\", as a winter retreat. It included a laboratory for his continuing work. After the lodge was completed in 1886, Edison and his wife, Mina, spent many winters in Fort Myers. Edison also enjoyed local recreational fishing, for which Fort Myers had gained a national reputation.<ref name=\"myriver\">{{cite web|url=http://www.myriverdistrict.com/p/about/212|title=History of Ft Myers|website=Myriverdistrict.com|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the Royal Palm Hotel was constructed.

This route provided Lee County both passenger and freight railroad service.<ref>Turner, Gregg M. ''A Journey Into Florida Railroad History''. University Press of Florida, p. 156. {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3233-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the Arcade Theater was constructed in downtown Fort Myers. Originally a vaudeville house, Edison viewed films here for the first time with friends [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/10390|title=Arcade Theater in Fort Myers, FL - Cinema Treasures|website=cinematreasures.org|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref> With the growth of the film industry, the Arcade Theatre was converted into a full movie house. A wall divided the stage in order to form two screening rooms. Changes in moviegoing habits since the late 20th century have led to the renovation of the theater for use again in live performance. It is now host to the Florida Repertory Theatre, a performing arts hall.\n\nDuring World War I, Edison became concerned about America's reliance on foreign supplies of rubber. He partnered with tire producer Harvey Firestone, of the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], and Henry Ford, of the [[Ford Motor Company]], to try to find a rubber tree or plant that could grow quickly in the United States. He sought one that would contain enough latex to support his research endeavor. In 1927, the three men contributed $25,000 each, and created the Edison Botanic Research Corporation in an attempt to find a solution to this problem.<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1928, the Edison Botanic Research Corporation laboratory was constructed. It was in Fort Myers that Edison conducted the majority of his research and planted exotic plants and trees. He sent results and sample rubber  residues to [[West Orange, New Jersey]], for further work at his large Thomas A. Edison \"Invention Factory\" (now preserved in the [[Thomas Edison National Historical Park]]). Through Edison's efforts, the [[Roystonea regia|royal palms]] lining Riverside Avenue (now McGregor Boulevard) were imported and planted. They inspired Fort Myers' nickname as \"City of Palms\".<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAfter testing 17,000 plant samples, Edison eventually discovered a source in the plant [[Goldenrod]] (Solidago leavenworthii). The rubber project was transferred to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] five years later.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n[[Image:Fordwinterhome2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Mangoes: Henry Ford's winter home]]\nIn 1916, automobile magnate Ford purchased the home next to Edison's from Robert Smith of New York. Ford named his estate \"the Mangoes\". Ford's craftsman-style \"bungalow\" was built in 1911 by Smith. Ford, Firestone, and Edison were leaders in American industry and part of an exclusive group titled \"the Millionaires' Club\". The three men have been memorialized in statues in downtown Fort Myers' Centennial Park.\n\nIn 1924, with the beginning of construction of the [[Edison Bridge (Florida)|Edison Bridge]], named for Edison, the city's population steadily grew. The bridge was opened on February 11, 1931, the 84th birthday of its namesake. Edison dedicated the bridge, and was the first to drive across it.\n\n[[File:Fort Myers FL Downtown HD Kress bldg01.jpg|thumb|Architecture of Downtown Fort Myers.]]\nIn the decade following the bridge's construction, the city had a real estate boom. Several new residential subdivisions were built beyond downtown, including Dean Park, Edison Park, and Seminole Park.<ref name=\"myriver\"/> Edison Park, located across McGregor Boulevard from the Edison and Ford properties, includes a number of Fort Myers' most stately homes. The historic development showcases a variety of architectural styles. In the 21st century, it is known for its community activities and strong neighborhood ties.<ref>[http://www.fortmyers-online.com/mcgregor-history.htm McGregor history], Fort Myers Online</ref>\n\nIn 1947, Mina Edison deeded Seminole Lodge to the city of Fort Myers, in memory of her late husband and for the enjoyment of the public. By 1988, the adjacent Henry Ford winter estate was purchased by the city and opened for public tours in 1990. The combined properties today are known as the [[Edison and Ford Winter Estates]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|40.4|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|31.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|8.6|sqmi}} (21.25%) is water.\n\nFort Myers is on the border between a [[tropical savanna climate]] and a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Randolph J.

{"title_page": "St John Passion discography", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''St John Passion'' discography}}\n'''Recordings''' of the '''''St John Passion''''' are shown as a sortable table of selected notable recordings of Johann Sebastian Bach's  ''[[St John Passion]]'', [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 245. The selection is taken from the 241 recordings listed on bach-cantatas as of 2015.\n\n== History ==\nThe work was first recorded by symphonic choirs and orchestras. From the late 1960s, [[historically informed performance]]s (HIP) tried to adhere more to the sounds of the composer's lifetime, who typically wrote for boys choirs and for comparatively small orchestras of [[Baroque instruments]], often now called \"period instruments\". Some scholars believe that Bach used only one singer for a vocal part in the choral movements, termed \"one voice per part\" (OVPP). On some of these recordings, the solo singer is reinforced in choral movements with a larger orchestra by a [[ripieno]] singer (OVPP+R).\n\n== Table of selected recordings ==\n\nThe sortable listing is taken mostly from the selection provided by Aryeh Oron on the Bach-Cantatas website.\n\nThe information lists for one recording typically:\n* '''Conductor / choir / orchestra''', sometimes several choirs\n* '''Soloists''' in the order [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]] ([[tenor]]), [[Vox Christi]] (Voice of [[Jesus]], [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]), [[soprano]], [[alto]], tenor (if the tenor arias are performed by a different tenor than the evangelist), bass (if the bass parts are performed by a different bass than the voice of Jesus).\n* '''Label'''\n* '''Year''' of the recording\n* '''Choir type'''\n*# Large choirs (red background): Bach (choir dedicated to Bach's music, founded in the mid of the 20th century), Boys (choir of all male voices), Radio (choir of a broadcaster), Symphony (choir related to a symphony orchestra)\n*# Medium-size choirs, such as Chamber choir, Chorale (choir dedicated mostly to church music)\n*# One voice per part (green background): OVPP or OVPP+R (with ripienists reinforcing the soloists in some chorale movements)\n* '''Orch. type''' (orchestra type)\n*# Large orchestras (red background): Bach (orchestra dedicated to Bach's music, founded in the mid of the 20th century), Radio (symphony orchestra of a broadcaster), Symphony\n*# Chamber orchestra\n*# Orchestra on period instruments (green background)\n\n{{Cantata discography header|work=Bach's

S. Bach]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''St John Passion'' discography}}\n'''Recordings''' of the '''''St John Passion''''' are shown as a sortable table of selected notable recordings of Johann Sebastian Bach's  ''[[St John Passion]]'', [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 245. The selection is taken from the 241 recordings listed on bach-cantatas as of 2015.\n\n== History ==\nThe work was first recorded by symphonic choirs and orchestras. From the late 1960s, [[historically informed performance]]s (HIP) tried to adhere more to the sounds of the composer's lifetime, who typically wrote for boys choirs and for comparatively small orchestras of [[Baroque instruments]], often now called \"period instruments\". Some scholars believe that Bach used only one singer for a vocal part in the choral movements, termed \"one voice per part\" (OVPP). On some of these recordings, the solo singer is reinforced in choral movements with a larger orchestra by a [[ripieno]] singer (OVPP+R).\n\n== Table of selected recordings ==\n\nThe sortable listing is taken mostly from the selection provided by Aryeh Oron on the Bach-Cantatas website.\n\nThe information lists for one recording typically:\n* '''Conductor / choir / orchestra''', sometimes several choirs\n* '''Soloists''' in the order [[Evangelist (Bach)|Evangelist]] ([[tenor]]), [[Vox Christi]] (Voice of [[Jesus]], [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]), [[soprano]], [[alto]], tenor (if the tenor arias are performed by a different tenor than the evangelist), bass (if the bass parts are performed by a different bass than the voice of Jesus).\n* '''Label'''\n* '''Year''' of the recording\n* '''Choir type'''\n*# Large choirs (red background): Bach (choir dedicated to Bach's music, founded in the mid of the 20th century), Boys (choir of all male voices), Radio (choir of a broadcaster), Symphony (choir related to a symphony orchestra)\n*# Medium-size choirs, such as Chamber choir, Chorale (choir dedicated mostly to church music)\n*# One voice per part (green background): OVPP or OVPP+R (with ripienists reinforcing the soloists in some chorale movements)\n* '''Orch. type''' (orchestra type)\n*# Large orchestras (red background): Bach (orchestra dedicated to Bach's music, founded in the mid of the 20th century), Radio (symphony orchestra of a broadcaster), Symphony\n*# Chamber orchestra\n*# Orchestra on period instruments (green background)\n\n{{Cantata discography header|work=Bach's
