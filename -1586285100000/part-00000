By the end of this period it displayed ceramic commonalities with communities as far west as the [[Troad]] and as far east as [[Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bronze Age Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/bronze-age-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Bronze Age]], Gordion came under the influence of the [[Hittites]], with administrative seals evident at the site. There is also an extensive necropolis attested on the Northeast Ridge, with burials of the MH III-IV periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mellink |first1=Machteld J. |title=A Hittite Cemetery at Gordion |date=1956 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780934718059}}</ref>\n\n[[Late Bronze Age]] Gordion was part of the Hittite Empire and located at the western edge of its heartland, approximately 200 kilometers west of the capital, [[Hattu\u0161a]].\n\n===Early Iron Age (ca. 1200-900 BCE)===\nThere is a cultural change at Gordion in the [[Early Iron Age]], with distinct differences from the [[Late Bronze Age]] in regard to architecture and ceramics. Ceramic and linguistic links with southeastern Europe point to an influx of Balkan migrants at this time, possibly the [[Bryges|Brygians]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Iron Age Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/iron-age-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> \n===Early Phrygian Period (ca. 900-800 BCE)===\nThere were several monumental construction projects on the citadel during the 10th and 9th centuries, the Early Phrygian period, resulting in a circuit wall around the Citadel Mound with an extensive gate complex. The Early Phrygian East Citadel Gate is preserved to a height of 10 meters, making it the best preserved example in Anatolia. Beyond the East Citadel Gate, a series of elite buildings occupied the eastern side of the mound. These included several megaron-plan buildings, and the large interconnected Terrace Building Complex. The Megarons at Gordion likely served an administrative function. They include several pebble mosaic floors with elaborate geometric designs, among the earliest known examples of their type.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Rodney S. |title=Early Mosaics at Gordion |journal=Expedition |date=1965 |volume=7 |pages=4-13}}</ref> The Terrace Building was a locus of grinding, cooking, and weaving, as well as storage. The remains of the Early Phrygian period were preserved due to a conflagration on the eastern side of the Citadel Mound, [[Gordium#Date of the Destruction|likely dating to ca. 800 BCE]]. This destruction level and the subsequent rebuilding of the site above it preserved the architecture and many of the finds from the Early Phrygian period. The Early Phrygian period at the site is thus better understood than the Middle Phrygian.\n====Date of the destruction====\nThere is ample evidence of widespread burning of the city mound of Gordion, in a level referred to by Young as the destruction level.  Archaeologists at first interpreted the destruction level as the remains of a Cimmerian attack, c. 700 BCE.  The traces were later reinterpreted as dating to c. 800 BCE, largely on the basis of [[dendrochronology]] and [[radiocarbon]] analysis, and with reference to the types of objects found in the burned level.<ref>[[Keith DeVries|K. DeVries]] et al., \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080404034146/http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/devries/devries.html New dates for the destruction levels at Gordion]\", ''Antiquity'' '''77''' (June 2003)</ref> If this reinterpretation is correct, then the otherwise-unrecorded destruction would seem to have been caused by a conflagration unrelated to a Cimmerian attack.  The earlier date, though, is contested, primarily on the basis of the types and styles of objects excavated in the destruction level, the latest of which are dated to c. 700 BCE by some scholars.<ref>O.W.

(Argues for the reinterpretation of the archaeological evidence.)</ref>  The  radiocarbon date seems to have a range wide enough to accommodate both proposed archaeological dates.<ref>D.J.

B. Rose, G. Darbyshire [Editors], ''The New Chronology of Iron Age Gordion'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum, 2011).</ref>\n===Middle Phrygian Period (ca. 800-540 BCE)===\nThe ca. 800 BCE destruction level marks the change from the Early Phrygian period to the Middle Phrygian. After the fire, the inhabitants of Gordion completed a massive construction program on the Citadel Mound that included the laying of up to 5 meters of clay to raise the height of the mound. The citadel was subsequently rebuilt on a largely similar plan, a process of monumentality that required an immense amount of labor and planning. The fortifications at Gordion at this time expanded to include a pair of forts to the north and south of the Citadel Mound connected by a circuit wall that enclosed an area over 25 hectares, the Lower Town. Beyond the Lower Town, settlement continued in the Outer Town, protected by a further wall and ditch. Settlement also stretched onto the Northeast Ridge, where a series of houses were destroyed in an attack by an unknown enemy around 700 BCE. During the Middle Phrygian period, Gordion grew to its largest size, encompassing an area of settlement of approximately 100 hectares. At this time the political influence of Phrygia in Anatolia increased substantially. During the 9th and 8th centuries BCE, the city grew into the capital of a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] that controlled much of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] west of the [[Halys River|river Halys]]. In the course of the 6th century BCE, the kingdom of [[Lydia]], Phrygia's neighbor to the southwest, began to exert influence within Anatolia, likely at the expense of Phrygian control. The incursion of [[Cyrus the Great]] and the Achaemenid Empire into Anatolia, beginning in 546 BCE, spelled the end of any Lydian control and of Phrygian autonomy at Gordion.\n====King Midas====\nThe most famous king of Phrygia was [[Midas]], who reigned during the Middle Phrygian period at Gordion. He was likely on the throne at Gordion by ca. 740 BCE, based on the completion of [[Gordion#Tumulus MM|Tumulus MM]] around that time. Contemporary [[Assyria]]n sources dating between c. 718 and 709 BCE call him ''Mit-ta-a''. According to the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], King Midas was the first foreigner to make an offering at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi, dedicating the throne from which he gave judgment.<ref>[[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'' (Herodotus)]] 1.14.</ref> During his reign, according to [[Strabo]], the nomadic [[Cimmerians]] invaded Asia Minor, and in 710/709 BCE, Midas was forced to ask for help from the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]]. In Strabo's account, King Midas committed suicide by drinking [[bull's blood]] when the Cimmerians overran the city.<ref>[[Strabo]] 1.3.21. L. Roller, \"The Legend of Midas\", ''[[Classical Antiquity (journal)|Classical Antiquity]]'' 2(1983): 299\u2013313.</ref> \n====Tumuli====\nThere are over 100 [[tumuli]] in the vicinity of Gordion, dating from the 9th to the 6th centuries BCE. The largest of these burial mounds have traditionally been associated with kings, especially Tumulus MM. There are two main necropoleis, the Northeast Ridge and the South Ridge. Tumulus W at Gordion, dating to ca. 850 BCE, is the earliest known at the site and the first known anywhere in Anatolia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=C. Brian |title=Fieldwork at Phrygian Gordion, 2013-2015 |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |date=2017 |volume=121 |issue=1 |page=171}}</ref> Tumuli are associated with inhumation burials at Gordion until the late 7th century, when cremation began at the site. The two traditions then coexisted through the 6th century BCE. \n=====Tumulus MM=====\n[[File:Gordion82.JPG|thumb|The Midas Mound Tumulus at Gordion, dated ca. 740 BCE.]]\nTumulus MM (for \"Midas Mound\"), the Great Tumulus, is the largest burial mound at Gordion, standing over 50 meters high today, with a diameter of about 300 meters. At the time it was built it was the largest tumulus in Anatolia and was only surpassed ca. 200 years later by the [[Alyattes of Lydia#Tomb|Tumulus of Alyattes]] in Lydia. Tumulus MM was excavated in 1957 by Young's team, revealing the remains of the royal occupant, resting on purple and golden textiles in an open log coffin, surrounded by a vast array of magnificent objects. The burial goods included pottery and bronze vessels containing organic residues, bronze fibulae (ancient safety pins), leather belts with bronze attachments, and an extraordinary collection of carved and inlaid  [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|wooden furniture]], exceptional for its state of preservation. The Tumulus MM funeral ceremony has been reconstructed, and scientists have determined that the guests at the banquet ate lamb or goat stew and drank a mixed fermented beverage.<ref>E.

There is extensive evidence for the Persian siege of 546 BCE at Gordion, mainly associated with the fort at K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck H\u00f6y\u00fck. The Persian attackers built a large siege ramp to assault the fortress, still visible today. After its conquest, Gordion became part of the satrapy of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], which had [[Dascylium|Daskyleion]] on the [[Sea of Marmara]], not Gordion, as its capital. Despite its relegation in status, Gordion initially continued to prosper under the Achaemenids, with tumulus burials and monumental buildings maintained through the 6th century. Around 500 BCE, a semi-subterranean structure, the Painted House, was added to the east side of the Citadel Mound. It featured a program of wall frescoes showing the procession of women. It is perhaps associated with cultic activity, although the nature of this is uncertain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Achaemenid Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/achaemenid-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe 4th century BCE at Gordion began with the combination of an earthquake and the attack of the Spartan king [[Agesilaus_II#Invasion_of_Achaemenid_Asia_Minor_(396-395)|Agesilaos]]. The subsequent century saw an absence of monumental buildings on the Citadel Mound, and, in fact, stone from many of the earlier structures was used for smaller buildings elsewhere around the site.\n\n===Hellenistic Period (ca. 330-1st century BCE)===\nThe advent of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 333 BCE precipitated a major change at the site, with worship of Greek deities, inscriptions in Greek, and Greek pottery all replacing their Phrygian predecessors at the site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hellenistic Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/hellenistic-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> The middle of the 3rd century BCE saw the arrival of the [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]], a Celtic people who first came to Anatolia as mercenaries hired by [[Nicomedes I of Bithynia]]. The Galatians ultimately settled in Phrygia, including at Gordion. The settlement at Gordion during this period shows a distinctly residential character, with large houses built over the public buildings of the Phrygian period. In 189 BCE, the Roman consul [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 189 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] campaigned through Galatia, forcing the inhabitants of Gordion to temporarily abandon the site. \n====Gordian Knot====\nAccording to ancient tradition, in 333 BCE [[Alexander the Great]] cut (or otherwise unfastened) the [[Gordian Knot]]: this intricate knot joined the yoke to the pole of a Phrygian wagon that stood on the acropolis of the city. The wagon was associated with Midas or Gordias (or both), and was connected with the dynasty's rise to power. A local prophecy had decreed that whoever could loosen the knot was destined to become the ruler of Asia.<ref>L. Roller, \"Midas and the Gordian Knot.\" ''[[Classical Antiquity (journal)|Classical Antiquity]]'' 3(1984): 256\u2013271.</ref>\n\n===Roman Period (1st-5th century CE)===\nThe Roman period at Gordion stretches from the 1st century CE through the 4th century, with a series of occupations and abandonments on the western part of the Citadel Mound.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/roman-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> The Roman road between Ankara and Pessinus passed through Gordion, which may have been known as Vindia/Vinda at this time. The Roman buildings at Gordion were oriented to cardinal directions and built as part of a deliberate re-foundation that included leveling the surface of the western part of the mound. The area of the Common Cemetery also includes Roman burials from the 2nd to 4th centuries CE. \n\n===Medieval Period (13th-14th century CE)===\nEvidence for the Medieval Period at Gordion is sparse but suggests habitation during the 13th and 14th centuries CE with at least some fortification.<ref>{{cite web |title=Medieval Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/medieval-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> Recent excavations have revealed lime-coated pits and ovens on the western side of the Citadel Mound, signalling food preparation and storage.<ref>{{cite web |title=Season Report 2015 |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/season-report-2015/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref>\n\n===Modern (1920s-Present)===\nGordion lay along the front lines of the 1921 [[Battle of the Sakarya]], the turning point of the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922]]. The Citadel Mound and several of the tumuli were used as defensive positions during the 3 weeks of fighting. The village of Bebi, located to the west of the Citadel Mound, was the main site of habitation in the area during the 19th and 20th centuries but was destroyed during the course of the battle.\n\n==Archaeological Research==\n===History of Research===\nThe site was excavated by [[Gustav K\u00f6rte]] and [[Alfred K\u00f6rte]] in 1900<ref>G. and A. K\u00f6rte, ''Gordion: Ergebnisse der Ausgrabung im Jahre 1900. Jahrbuch des kaiserlich deutschen arch\u00e4ologischen Instituts'' V (Berlin, 1904).</ref> and then by the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], under the direction of [[Rodney Young (archaeologist)|Rodney S. Young]], between 1950 and 1973.<ref>R.S. Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli. The Gordion Excavations Final Reports, Volume 1'' (Philadelphia, 1981).</ref> Excavations have continued at the site under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum with an international team, directed by Keith DeVries (1977-1987), G. Kenneth Sams and Mary M. Voigt (1988-2006), and G. Kenneth Sams and C. Brian Rose (2007-present). Finds from Gordion are on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in Ankara, the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museums]], and the [[Gordion Museum]], located in Yass\u0131h\u00f6y\u00fck itself.\n===Current Research===\n====Excavation====\nThe Gordion Project renewed excavations in 2013, focusing on the southern fortifications and revealing a new approach and gateway to the Citadel Mound.<ref>{{cite web |title=Season Report 2013 |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/season-report-2013/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> This new South Gate was originally constructed during the 9th century BC, contemporaneous with the Early Phrygian phase of the East Citadel Gate. The South Gate saw further modifications in the 8th and 6th centuries, and its approach road ultimately reached over 65 m in length, the longest known for a citadel gate in Anatolia.\n====Architectural Conservation====\nSince 2009, the project has undertaken a renewed program of architectural conservation on the Terrace Building Complex on the Citadel Mound, the large industrial quarter that burned in the Destruction Level ca. 800 BCE.<ref>{{cite web |title=Site Report 2014 |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/season-report-2014/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> From 2014 to 2019, the architectural conservation team focused its efforts on restoring the South Bastion of the East Citadel Gate, affected by an earthquake in 1999. This project consolidated cracked stones and reinstalled them in the wall faces with stainless-steel supports and addressed the drainage of the South Bastion.\n====Remote Sensing====\nSince 2007, another primary focus of the Gordion Project has been the exploration of the city's defensive fortifications beyond the Citadel Mound.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=C. Brian |title=Fieldwork at Phrygian Gordion, 2013-2015 |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |date=2017 |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=143-147 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.121.1.0135?seq=1&cid=pdf-reference#references_tab_contents}}</ref> The use of [[magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetometry]], [[electrical resistivity tomography]], and [[ground-penetrating radar]] have allowed for a more complete reconstruction of the defense network and urban districts of the city during the Iron Age.\n====Publication====\nThe results of the excavations at Gordion are the subject of study for an international team of scholars, with ongoing research into all periods of the site's history.

By the end of this period it displayed ceramic commonalities with communities as far west as the [[Troad]] and as far east as [[Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bronze Age Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/bronze-age-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Bronze Age]], Gordion came under the influence of the [[Hittites]], with administrative seals evident at the site. There is also an extensive necropolis attested on the Northeast Ridge, with burials of the MH III-IV periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mellink |first1=Machteld J. |title=A Hittite Cemetery at Gordion |date=1956 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780934718059}}</ref>\n\n[[Late Bronze Age]] Gordion was part of the Hittite Empire and located at the western edge of its heartland, approximately 200 kilometers west of the capital, [[Hattu\u0161a]].\n\n===Early Iron Age (ca. 1200-900 BCE)===\nThere is a cultural change at Gordion in the [[Early Iron Age]], with distinct differences from the [[Late Bronze Age]] in regard to architecture and ceramics. Ceramic and linguistic links with southeastern Europe point to an influx of Balkan migrants at this time, possibly the [[Bryges|Brygians]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Iron Age Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/iron-age-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> \n===Early Phrygian Period (ca. 900-800 BCE)===\nThere were several monumental construction projects on the citadel during the 10th and 9th centuries, the Early Phrygian period, resulting in a circuit wall around the Citadel Mound with an extensive gate complex. The Early Phrygian East Citadel Gate is preserved to a height of 10 meters, making it the best preserved example in Anatolia. Beyond the East Citadel Gate, a series of elite buildings occupied the eastern side of the mound. These included several megaron-plan buildings, and the large interconnected Terrace Building Complex. The Megarons at Gordion likely served an administrative function. They include several pebble mosaic floors with elaborate geometric designs, among the earliest known examples of their type.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Rodney S. |title=Early Mosaics at Gordion |journal=Expedition |date=1965 |volume=7 |pages=4-13}}</ref> The Terrace Building was a locus of grinding, cooking, and weaving, as well as storage. The remains of the Early Phrygian period were preserved due to a conflagration on the eastern side of the Citadel Mound, [[Gordium#Date of the Destruction|likely dating to ca. 800 BCE]]. This destruction level and the subsequent rebuilding of the site above it preserved the architecture and many of the finds from the Early Phrygian period. The Early Phrygian period at the site is thus better understood than the Middle Phrygian.\n====Date of the destruction====\nThere is ample evidence of widespread burning of the city mound of Gordion, in a level referred to by Young as the destruction level.  Archaeologists at first interpreted the destruction level as the remains of a Cimmerian attack, c. 700 BCE.  The traces were later reinterpreted as dating to c. 800 BCE, largely on the basis of [[dendrochronology]] and [[radiocarbon]] analysis, and with reference to the types of objects found in the burned level.<ref>[[Keith DeVries|K. DeVries]] et al., \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080404034146/http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/devries/devries.html New dates for the destruction levels at Gordion]\", ''Antiquity'' '''77''' (June 2003)</ref> If this reinterpretation is correct, then the otherwise-unrecorded destruction would seem to have been caused by a conflagration unrelated to a Cimmerian attack.  The earlier date, though, is contested, primarily on the basis of the types and styles of objects excavated in the destruction level, the latest of which are dated to c. 700 BCE by some scholars.<ref>O.W.

(Argues for the reinterpretation of the archaeological evidence.)</ref>  The  radiocarbon date seems to have a range wide enough to accommodate both proposed archaeological dates.<ref>D.J.

B. Rose, G. Darbyshire [Editors], ''The New Chronology of Iron Age Gordion'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum, 2011).</ref>\n===Middle Phrygian Period (ca. 800-540 BCE)===\nThe ca. 800 BCE destruction level marks the change from the Early Phrygian period to the Middle Phrygian. After the fire, the inhabitants of Gordion completed a massive construction program on the Citadel Mound that included the laying of up to 5 meters of clay to raise the height of the mound. The citadel was subsequently rebuilt on a largely similar plan, a process of monumentality that required an immense amount of labor and planning. The fortifications at Gordion at this time expanded to include a pair of forts to the north and south of the Citadel Mound connected by a circuit wall that enclosed an area over 25 hectares, the Lower Town. Beyond the Lower Town, settlement continued in the Outer Town, protected by a further wall and ditch. Settlement also stretched onto the Northeast Ridge, where a series of houses were destroyed in an attack by an unknown enemy around 700 BCE. During the Middle Phrygian period, Gordion grew to its largest size, encompassing an area of settlement of approximately 100 hectares. At this time the political influence of Phrygia in Anatolia increased substantially. During the 9th and 8th centuries BCE, the city grew into the capital of a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] that controlled much of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] west of the [[Halys River|river Halys]]. In the course of the 6th century BCE, the kingdom of [[Lydia]], Phrygia's neighbor to the southwest, began to exert influence within Anatolia, likely at the expense of Phrygian control. The incursion of [[Cyrus the Great]] and the Achaemenid Empire into Anatolia, beginning in 546 BCE, spelled the end of any Lydian control and of Phrygian autonomy at Gordion.\n====King Midas====\nThe most famous king of Phrygia was [[Midas]], who reigned during the Middle Phrygian period at Gordion. He was likely on the throne at Gordion by ca. 740 BCE, based on the completion of [[Gordion#Tumulus MM|Tumulus MM]] around that time. Contemporary [[Assyria]]n sources dating between c. 718 and 709 BCE call him ''Mit-ta-a''. According to the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], King Midas was the first foreigner to make an offering at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi, dedicating the throne from which he gave judgment.<ref>[[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'' (Herodotus)]] 1.14.</ref> During his reign, according to [[Strabo]], the nomadic [[Cimmerians]] invaded Asia Minor, and in 710/709 BCE, Midas was forced to ask for help from the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]]. In Strabo's account, King Midas committed suicide by drinking [[bull's blood]] when the Cimmerians overran the city.<ref>[[Strabo]] 1.3.21. L. Roller, \"The Legend of Midas\", ''[[Classical Antiquity (journal)|Classical Antiquity]]'' 2(1983): 299\u2013313.</ref> \n====Tumuli====\nThere are over 100 [[tumuli]] in the vicinity of Gordion, dating from the 9th to the 6th centuries BCE. The largest of these burial mounds have traditionally been associated with kings, especially Tumulus MM. There are two main necropoleis, the Northeast Ridge and the South Ridge. Tumulus W at Gordion, dating to ca. 850 BCE, is the earliest known at the site and the first known anywhere in Anatolia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=C. Brian |title=Fieldwork at Phrygian Gordion, 2013-2015 |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |date=2017 |volume=121 |issue=1 |page=171}}</ref> Tumuli are associated with inhumation burials at Gordion until the late 7th century, when cremation began at the site. The two traditions then coexisted through the 6th century BCE. \n=====Tumulus MM=====\n[[File:Gordion82.JPG|thumb|The Midas Mound Tumulus at Gordion, dated ca. 740 BCE.]]\nTumulus MM (for \"Midas Mound\"), the Great Tumulus, is the largest burial mound at Gordion, standing over 50 meters high today, with a diameter of about 300 meters. At the time it was built it was the largest tumulus in Anatolia and was only surpassed ca. 200 years later by the [[Alyattes of Lydia#Tomb|Tumulus of Alyattes]] in Lydia. Tumulus MM was excavated in 1957 by Young's team, revealing the remains of the royal occupant, resting on purple and golden textiles in an open log coffin, surrounded by a vast array of magnificent objects. The burial goods included pottery and bronze vessels containing organic residues, bronze fibulae (ancient safety pins), leather belts with bronze attachments, and an extraordinary collection of carved and inlaid  [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|wooden furniture]], exceptional for its state of preservation. The Tumulus MM funeral ceremony has been reconstructed, and scientists have determined that the guests at the banquet ate lamb or goat stew and drank a mixed fermented beverage.<ref>E.

There is extensive evidence for the Persian siege of 546 BCE at Gordion, mainly associated with the fort at K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck H\u00f6y\u00fck. The Persian attackers built a large siege ramp to assault the fortress, still visible today. After its conquest, Gordion became part of the satrapy of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]], which had [[Dascylium|Daskyleion]] on the [[Sea of Marmara]], not Gordion, as its capital. Despite its relegation in status, Gordion initially continued to prosper under the Achaemenids, with tumulus burials and monumental buildings maintained through the 6th century. Around 500 BCE, a semi-subterranean structure, the Painted House, was added to the east side of the Citadel Mound. It featured a program of wall frescoes showing the procession of women. It is perhaps associated with cultic activity, although the nature of this is uncertain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Achaemenid Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/achaemenid-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe 4th century BCE at Gordion began with the combination of an earthquake and the attack of the Spartan king [[Agesilaus_II#Invasion_of_Achaemenid_Asia_Minor_(396-395)|Agesilaos]]. The subsequent century saw an absence of monumental buildings on the Citadel Mound, and, in fact, stone from many of the earlier structures was used for smaller buildings elsewhere around the site.\n\n===Hellenistic Period (ca. 330-1st century BCE===\nThe advent of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 333 BCE precipitated a major change at the site, with worship of Greek deities, inscriptions in Greek, and Greek pottery all replacing their Phrygian predecessors at the site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hellenistic Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/hellenistic-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> The middle of the 3rd century BCE saw the arrival of the [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]], a Celtic people who first came to Anatolia as mercenaries hired by [[Nicomedes I of Bithynia]]. The Galatians ultimately settled in Phrygia, including at Gordion. The settlement at Gordion during this period shows a distinctly residential character, with large houses built over the public buildings of the Phrygian period. In 189 BCE, the Roman consul [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso (consul 189 BC)|Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] campaigned through Galatia, forcing the inhabitants of Gordion to temporarily abandon the site. \n====Gordian Knot====\nAccording to ancient tradition, in 333 BCE [[Alexander the Great]] cut (or otherwise unfastened) the [[Gordian Knot]]: this intricate knot joined the yoke to the pole of a Phrygian wagon that stood on the acropolis of the city. The wagon was associated with Midas or Gordias (or both), and was connected with the dynasty's rise to power. A local prophecy had decreed that whoever could loosen the knot was destined to become the ruler of Asia.<ref>L. Roller, \"Midas and the Gordian Knot.\" ''[[Classical Antiquity (journal)|Classical Antiquity]]'' 3(1984): 256\u2013271.</ref>\n\n===Roman Period (1st-5th century CE)===\nThe Roman period at Gordion stretches from the 1st century CE through the 4th century, with a series of occupations and abandonments on the western part of the Citadel Mound.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/roman-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> The Roman road between Ankara and Pessinus passed through Gordion, which may have been known as Vindia/Vinda at this time. The Roman buildings at Gordion were oriented to cardinal directions and built as part of a deliberate re-foundation that included leveling the surface of the western part of the mound. The area of the Common Cemetery also includes Roman burials from the 2nd to 4th centuries CE. \n\n===Medieval Period (13th-14th century CE)===\nEvidence for the Medieval Period at Gordion is sparse but suggests habitation during the 13th and 14th centuries CE with at least some fortification.<ref>{{cite web |title=Medieval Gordion |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/medieval-gordion/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> Recent excavations have revealed lime-coated pits and ovens on the western side of the Citadel Mound, signalling food preparation and storage.<ref>{{cite web |title=Season Report 2015 |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/season-report-2015/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref>\n\n===Modern (1920s-Present)===\nGordion lay along the front lines of the 1921 [[Battle of the Sakarya]], the turning point of the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922]]. The Citadel Mound and several of the tumuli were used as defensive positions during the 3 weeks of fighting. The village of Bebi, located to the west of the Citadel Mound, was the main site of habitation in the area during the 19th and 20th centuries but was destroyed during the course of the battle.\n\n==Archaeological Research==\n===History of Research===\nThe site was excavated by [[Gustav K\u00f6rte]] and [[Alfred K\u00f6rte]] in 1900<ref>G. and A. K\u00f6rte, ''Gordion: Ergebnisse der Ausgrabung im Jahre 1900. Jahrbuch des kaiserlich deutschen arch\u00e4ologischen Instituts'' V (Berlin, 1904).</ref> and then by the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], under the direction of [[Rodney Young (archaeologist)|Rodney S. Young]], between 1950 and 1973.<ref>R.S. Young, ''Three Great Early Tumuli. The Gordion Excavations Final Reports, Volume 1'' (Philadelphia, 1981).</ref> Excavations have continued at the site under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum with an international team, directed by Keith DeVries (1977-1987), G. Kenneth Sams and Mary M. Voigt (1988-2006), and G. Kenneth Sams and C. Brian Rose (2007-present). Finds from Gordion are on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in Ankara, the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museums]], and the [[Gordion Museum]], located in Yass\u0131h\u00f6y\u00fck itself.\n===Current Research===\n====Excavation====\nThe Gordion Project renewed excavations in 2013, focusing on the southern fortifications and revealing a new approach and gateway to the Citadel Mound.<ref>{{cite web |title=Season Report 2013 |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/season-report-2013/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> This new South Gate was originally constructed during the 9th century BC, contemporaneous with the Early Phrygian phase of the East Citadel Gate. The South Gate saw further modifications in the 8th and 6th centuries, and its approach road ultimately reached over 65 m in length, the longest known for a citadel gate in Anatolia.\n====Architectural Conservation====\nSince 2009, the project has undertaken a renewed program of architectural conservation on the Terrace Building Complex on the Citadel Mound, the large industrial quarter that burned in the Destruction Level ca. 800 BCE.<ref>{{cite web |title=Site Report 2014 |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/gordion/season-report-2014/ |website=The Gordion Archaeological Project |publisher=Penn Museum}}</ref> From 2014 to 2019, the architectural conservation team focused its efforts on restoring the South Bastion of the East Citadel Gate, affected by an earthquake in 1999. This project consolidated cracked stones and reinstalled them in the wall faces with stainless-steel supports and addressed the drainage of the South Bastion.\n====Remote Sensing====\nSince 2007, another primary focus of the Gordion Project has been the exploration of the city's defensive fortifications beyond the Citadel Mound.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=C. Brian |title=Fieldwork at Phrygian Gordion, 2013-2015 |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |date=2017 |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=143-147 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.121.1.0135?seq=1&cid=pdf-reference#references_tab_contents}}</ref> The use of [[magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetometry]], [[electrical resistivity tomography]], and [[ground-penetrating radar]] have allowed for a more complete reconstruction of the defense network and urban districts of the city during the Iron Age.\n====Publication====\nThe results of the excavations at Gordion are the subject of study for an international team of scholars, with ongoing research into all periods of the site's history.

It is west of the midlands of Ireland, about {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Galway]] city. Humans have lived in the area since the [[Prehistoric Ireland#Copper and Bronze Ages (2500\u2013500 BC)|Bronze Age]] while the historic period dates from the 6th century. The town became increasingly important in the 11th and 12th centuries in political and religious aspects of Ireland. The market-based layout of the town and square indicates the importance of commerce.\n\n==History==\nThe record of human settlement in Tuam dates back to the Bronze Age when an area adjacent to Shop Street was used as a burial ground. The name Tuam is a [[cognate]] with the [[Latin]] term [[tumulus]] (burial mound). The town's ancient name was ''Tuaim D\u00e1 Ghualann'', i.e. the burial mound of two shoulders.\n\nThe name probably refers to the high ground on either side of the River Nanny, overlooking a probable fording point over the River Nanny (or Corchra). In 1875, a Bronze Age burial [[urn]] was discovered in the area by workmen, dating from c.1500 B.C.<ref>A Brief History of Tuam. A Town of Two Cathedrals. 2006</ref>\n\nThe history of Tuam as a settlement dates from the early sixth century. Legend states that a monk called [[Iarlaithe mac Loga]] who was a member of a religious community at [[Cloonfush]] some {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Tuam and adjacent to the religious settlement at [[Kilbannon]]. According to the Life of [[Brendan of Clonfert]], Brendan eventually told Iarlaithe \"Not here at all shall be thy resurrection\". When Iarlaithe asked where this may be, Brendan responded: \"Have a new chariot made for thou art old; and go thy way in it, and wherever the two hind shafts of the chariot will break, there will be thy resurrection, and that of many others with thee\".<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |title=Lives of Irish Saints |chapter=Life of Brendan of Clonfert |volume=2 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1922 |ISBN=0-19-821389-1 |pages=47\u201348}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=P\u00e1draig |last=\u00d3 Riain |title=A Dictionary of Irish Saints |publisher=Four Courts Press |location=Dublin |date=2011 |ISBN=978-1-84682-318-3 |pages=115\u2013116, 374}}</ref> Iarlaithe's wheel broke at Tuam and he established a monastery there, known as the [[School of Tuam]]. As was typical with early settlements in Ireland, religious sites became established first and towns grew around them. Likewise, Tuam grew up around the monastery and has kept the broken chariot wheel as its [[heraldry|heraldic symbol]].\n\nIn 1049, Aedh O'Connor defeated Amalgaid ua Flaithbertaigh, King of [[Iar Connacht]], making the [[O'Conor|O'Connors]] [[list of kings of Connacht|provincial kings of Connacht]]. He then built a castle at Tuam and made it his principal stronghold. This event was directly responsible for the subsequent rise in the importance of the town. Its position dominated the Iar Connacht heartland of [[Maigh Se\u00f3la]].\n\nIn the twelfth century, the town became the centre of Provincial power during the fifty-year reign of [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (r. 1106\u20131156). He also brought Tuam its most prominent status as seat of the [[High King of Ireland]] which he achieved by force of arms during his long career.\n\nAbout 1140 Tairrdelach founded an Augustinian priory in Tuam with possession over three church sites in [[Ciarraige Locha na n\u00c1irne|Ciarraige Airne]], east County Mayo.<ref>See Anne Connon, 'Plotting Acallam na Senorach: the physical context of the 'Mayo' sequence, p85 in Sarah Sheehan [et al.](ed.) Gablanach in Scelaigecht: Celtic studies in honour of Ann Dooley (Dublin, 2013)</ref> At the [[Synod of Kells]] in [[1152 in Ireland|1152]], the centre of government also became the ecclesiastical centre, as Tuam was elevated to an [[Archbishop of Tuam|Archbishopric]], with [[\u00c1ed Ua hOiss\u00edn]] as the first Archbishop.\n\nTairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, as High King of Ireland from [[1128 in Ireland|1128]]\u2013[[1156 in Ireland|1156]], was a great patron of the Irish Church and it was due to his patronage that Tuam became the home of some masterpieces of 12th century Celtic art, including the [[Cross of Cong]]. Tairrdelbach was succeeded by his son [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]], the last native High King of Ireland. In [[1164 in Ireland|1164]], Ruaidr\u00ed had a \"wonderful castle\" erected, with a large courtyard defended by lofty and massive walls and a deep moat into which the adjacent river was diverted through. This was the first Irish built stone castle.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Gentleman's Magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/gentlemansmagaz304unkngoog|year=1823|publisher=A. Dodd and A. Smith|page=[https://archive.org/details/gentlemansmagaz304unkngoog/page/n361 333]}}</ref> A small part of the castle still stands. Following the destruction of the first Cathedral in [[1184 in Ireland|1184]], [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] left Tuam and retired to [[Cong Abbey]], where he entrusted the Church valuables from the Cathedral at Tuam into the care of the abbot. This left Tuam as a small settlement and it wasn't until the early 17th century that it began to grow in importance again.\n\nThroughout history, Tuam has been an important commercial centre with fairs and markets being an important part of commerce in the region. One of its fairs dates to 1252 when Letters Patent were granted to Archbishop MacFlynn by [[Henry III of England]]. Other fairs were authorised by Charters granted by [[James VI and I]] and [[George III of the United Kingdom]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Tuam Official Guide c.1958</ref>\n\nThe [[Annals of the Four Masters]] record that in 1488 \"A whirlwind attacked a number of persons, as they were cutting turf on the bog of Tuaim-Mona, which killed one of them, and swelled the faces of the rest; and four others were killed by the same wind in Machaire-Chonnacht.\"\n\nIn July 1920, the town hall and other properties were burned down by armed [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] men, after two had been killed in an ambush by the [[Irish Republican Army]] near the town the day before.\n\n===Borough of Tuam===\n[[File:Chair_of_Tuam_Monument.JPG|thumb|upright|Chair of Tuam Monument]]\nOn 30 March 1613, Tuam received a royal charter from James VI and I, which enabled the [[Tuam (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tuam Parliamentary constituency]] to send two representatives to [[Irish House of Commons]] until its abolition in 1800. The town was laid out as a market town to its present plan with all the streets converging on the central square. The charter also established a formal local council with an elected sovereign and 12 burgesses. The sovereign was sworn into office at the site of the \"Chair of Tuam\" which is believed to be within the remaining tower of Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair's castle. A monumental \"Chair of Tuam\" was unveiled in May 1980 by the late [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich|Cardinal Tom\u00e1s O'Fiaich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuam-guide.com/history.htm |title=Tuam History Tuam Galway Tuam County Galway Tuam Ireland Tuaim County Galway |publisher=Tuam-guide.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===High crosses of Tuam===\n[[File:HighCrossTuam01.jpg|left|200px|thumb|High Cross of Tuam]]\n[[File:HeadpieceTuamHighCross.jpg|right|270px|thumb|Headpiece of the High Cross of Tuam]]\nThe High Cross of Tuam was erected in 1152 possibly to commemorate the appointment of the first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]], Archbishop \u00c1ed Ua hOiss\u00edn. An inscription at the base calls for \"A prayer for O'hOis\u00edn; for the Abbot; by whom it was made\". It is reputed to have been the tallest of the High Crosses of Ireland, but its artistry is scarred by the absence of the top portion of the main shaft.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The sandstone Cross was originally erected in proximity to the earliest Cathedral erected in the town, a part of which still remains and is incorporated into [[St Mary's Cathedral, Tuam|St Mary's Cathedral]] (12th-century red sandstone chancel arch in Irish [[Romanesque architecture]], which is a National monument). The original High Cross or Market cross may have been erected close to what is now the Market Square and High Street.\n\nWhen the first Cathedral collapsed after being destroyed by fire in 1184, the High Cross was dismantled into pieces, each under different ownership. The archaeologist [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]] discovered the base of the High Cross c. 1820 and later discovered two other pieces in other locations. The High Cross contains a portion from another High Cross, the ringed cross-section on top. In addition to the Market Cross, it is likely that there were at least four other carved stone crosses from the Connor's reign in the town. An area close to the town Square, known as the Shambles, which continued to function as a market place until recently, was at one point the location of the Market Cross until 1721.<ref>[http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/publications/tuam/6.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210052200/http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/publications/tuam/6.html |date=10 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe Cross was brought to Dublin for the Great Exhibition of 1852. However, prior to its return to Tuam, a disagreement arose between the two Churches. Catholic Archbishop Dr. [[John MacHale]] claimed the Cross rightfully belonged to Catholics, with Dean Charles Seymour of the Church of Ireland asserting a Protestant claim. Agreement was reached with the Cross erected half way between both Cathedrals and positioned so that it was visible from all main streets of the town. It was in the Square in the town centre in 1874.\n\nBy the late 1980s, it was evident that the decorative stone carving of the Cross was deteriorating due to weathering and pollution. Experts thought that there was a danger from traffic passing nearby. After lengthy discussions, the Office of Public Works removed the monument from the Square in April 1992. Following cleaning and minor restoration, the High Cross was re-erected in the south transept of St Mary's Cathedral, where it now is, near its original location. St Mary's Cathedral also houses the shaft of a third Cross fashioned from limestone. It is thought that all of the High Crosses would have marked the boundaries of the monastic section of Tuam.\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe [[Christian cross variants#Forms of the Cross|red latin cross]] is representative of Tuam's importance as an ecclesiastical centre. The double green [[flaunch]]es at the sides, represent the two hills or shoulders of Tuam's ancient name, ''Tuaim Dh\u00e1 Ghualainn''. The two crowns recall the High Kings, Tairrdelbach and Ruaidr\u00ed, who were based in Tuam. The broken chariot wheel being a reminder of the foundation of the monastic town when Iarlaithe's chariot wheel broke. The motto of the town, ''Tuath Thuama go Buan'', translates as \"Long Live the People of Tuam\".<ref>Glimpses of Tuam Since the Famine, J.A.

It is west of the midlands of Ireland, about {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Galway]] city. Humans have lived in the area since the [[Prehistoric Ireland#Copper and Bronze Ages (2500\u2013500 BC)|Bronze Age]] while the historic period dates from the 6th century. The town became increasingly important in the 11th and 12th centuries in political and religious aspects of Ireland. The market-based layout of the town and square indicates the importance of commerce.\n\n==History==\nThe record of human settlement in Tuam dates back to the Bronze Age when an area adjacent to Shop Street was used as a burial ground. The name Tuam is a [[cognate]] with the [[Latin]] term [[tumulus]] (burial mound). The town's ancient name was ''Tuaim D\u00e1 Ghualann'', i.e. the burial mound of two shoulders.\n\nThe name probably refers to the high ground on either side of the River Nanny, overlooking a probable fording point over the River Nanny (or Corchra). In 1875, a Bronze Age burial [[urn]] was discovered in the area by workmen, dating from c.1500 B.C.<ref>A Brief History of Tuam. A Town of Two Cathedrals. 2006</ref>\n\nThe history of Tuam as a settlement dates from the early sixth century. Legend states that a monk called [[Iarlaithe mac Loga]] who was a member of a religious community at [[Cloonfush]] some {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Tuam and adjacent to the religious settlement at [[Kilbannon]]. According to the Life of [[Brendan of Clonfert]], Brendan eventually told Iarlaithe \"Not here at all shall be thy resurrection\". When Iarlaithe asked where this may be, Brendan responded: \"Have a new chariot made for thou art old; and go thy way in it, and wherever the two hind shafts of the chariot will break, there will be thy resurrection, and that of many others with thee\".<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |title=Lives of Irish Saints |chapter=Life of Brendan of Clonfert |volume=2 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1922 |ISBN=0-19-821389-1 |pages=47\u201348}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=P\u00e1draig |last=\u00d3 Riain |title=A Dictionary of Irish Saints |publisher=Four Courts Press |location=Dublin |date=2011 |ISBN=978-1-84682-318-3 |pages=115\u2013116, 374}}</ref> Iarlaithe's wheel broke at Tuam and he established a monastery there, known as the [[School of Tuam]]. As was typical with early settlements in Ireland, religious sites became established first and towns grew around them. Likewise, Tuam grew up around the monastery and has kept the broken chariot wheel as its [[heraldry|heraldic symbol]].\n\nIn 1049, Aedh O'Connor defeated Amalgaid ua Flaithbertaigh, King of [[Iar Connacht]], making the [[O'Conor|O'Connors]] [[list of kings of Connacht|provincial kings of Connacht]]. He then built a castle at Tuam and made it his principal stronghold. This event was directly responsible for the subsequent rise in the importance of the town. Its position dominated the Iar Connacht heartland of [[Maigh Se\u00f3la]].\n\nIn the twelfth century, the town became the centre of Provincial power during the fifty-year reign of [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (r. 1106\u20131156). He also brought Tuam its most prominent status as seat of the [[High King of Ireland]] which he achieved by force of arms during his long career.\n\nAbout 1140 Tairrdelach founded an Augustinian priory in Tuam with possession over three church sites in [[Ciarraige Locha na n\u00c1irne|Ciarraige Airne]], east County Mayo.<ref>See Anne Connon, 'Plotting Acallam na Senorach: the physical context of the 'Mayo' sequence, p85 in Sarah Sheehan [et al.](ed.) Gablanach in Scelaigecht: Celtic studies in honour of Ann Dooley (Dublin, 2013)</ref> At the [[Synod of Kells]] in [[1152 in Ireland|1152]], the centre of government also became the ecclesiastical centre, as Tuam was elevated to an [[Archbishop of Tuam|Archbishopric]], with [[\u00c1ed Ua hOiss\u00edn]] as the first Archbishop.\n\nTairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, as High King of Ireland from [[1128 in Ireland|1128]]\u2013[[1156 in Ireland|1156]], was a great patron of the Irish Church and it was due to his patronage that Tuam became the home of some masterpieces of 12th century Celtic art, including the [[Cross of Cong]]. Tairrdelbach was succeeded by his son [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]], the last native High King of Ireland. In [[1164 in Ireland|1164]], Ruaidr\u00ed had a \"wonderful castle\" erected, with a large courtyard defended by lofty and massive walls and a deep moat into which the adjacent river was diverted through. This was the first Irish built stone castle.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Gentleman's Magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/gentlemansmagaz304unkngoog|year=1823|publisher=A. Dodd and A. Smith|page=[https://archive.org/details/gentlemansmagaz304unkngoog/page/n361 333]}}</ref> A small part of the castle still stands. Following the destruction of the first Cathedral in [[1184 in Ireland|1184]], [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] left Tuam and retired to [[Cong Abbey]], where he entrusted the Church valuables from the Cathedral at Tuam into the care of the abbot. This left Tuam as a small settlement and it wasn't until the early 17th century that it began to grow in importance again.\n\nThroughout history, Tuam has been an important commercial centre with fairs and markets being an important part of commerce in the region. One of its fairs dates to 1252 when Letters Patent were granted to Archbishop MacFlynn by [[Henry III of England]]. Other fairs were authorised by Charters granted by [[James VI and I]] and [[George III of the United Kingdom]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Tuam Official Guide c.1958</ref>\n\nThe [[Annals of the Four Masters]] record that in 1488 \"A whirlwind attacked a number of persons, as they were cutting turf on the bog of Tuaim-Mona, which killed one of them, and swelled the faces of the rest; and four others were killed by the same wind in Machaire-Chonnacht.\"\n\nIn July 1920, the town hall and other properties were burned down by armed [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] men, after two had been killed in an ambush by the [[Irish Republican Army]] near the town the day before.\n\n===Borough of Tuam===\n[[File:Chair_of_Tuam_Monument.JPG|thumb|upright|Chair of Tuam Monument]]\nOn 30 March 1613, Tuam received a royal charter from James VI and I, which enabled the [[Tuam (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tuam Parliamentary constituency]] to send two representatives to [[Irish House of Commons]] until its abolition in 1800. The town was laid out as a market town to its present plan with all the streets converging on the central square. The charter also established a formal local council with an elected sovereign and 12 burgesses. The sovereign was sworn into office at the site of the \"Chair of Tuam\" which is believed to be within the remaining tower of Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair's castle. A monumental \"Chair of Tuam\" was unveiled in May 1980 by the late [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich|Cardinal Tom\u00e1s O'Fiaich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuam-guide.com/history.htm |title=Tuam History Tuam Galway Tuam County Galway Tuam Ireland Tuaim County Galway |publisher=Tuam-guide.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===High crosses of Tuam===\n[[File:HighCrossTuam01.jpg|left|200px|thumb|High Cross of Tuam]]\n[[File:HeadpieceTuamHighCross.jpg|right|270px|thumb|Headpiece of the High Cross of Tuam]]\nThe High Cross of Tuam was erected in 1152 possibly to commemorate the appointment of the first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]], Archbishop \u00c1ed Ua hOiss\u00edn. An inscription at the base calls for \"A prayer for O'hOis\u00edn; for the Abbot; by whom it was made\". It is reputed to have been the tallest of the High Crosses of Ireland, but its artistry is scarred by the absence of the top portion of the main shaft.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The sandstone Cross was originally erected in proximity to the earliest Cathedral erected in the town, a part of which still remains and is incorporated into [[St Mary's Cathedral, Tuam|St Mary's Cathedral]] (12th-century red sandstone chancel arch in Irish [[Romanesque architecture]], which is a National monument). The original High Cross or Market cross may have been erected close to what is now the Market Square and High Street.\n\nWhen the first Cathedral collapsed after being destroyed by fire in 1184, the High Cross was dismantled into pieces, each under different ownership. The archaeologist [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]] discovered the base of the High Cross c. 1820 and later discovered two other pieces in other locations. The High Cross contains a portion from another High Cross, the ringed cross-section on top. In addition to the Market Cross, it is likely that there were at least four other carved stone crosses from the Connor's reign in the town. An area close to the town Square, known as the Shambles, which continued to function as a market place until recently, was at one point the location of the Market Cross until 1721.<ref>[http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/publications/tuam/6.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210052200/http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/publications/tuam/6.html |date=10 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe Cross was brought to Dublin for the Great Exhibition of 1852. However, prior to its return to Tuam, a disagreement arose between the two Churches. Catholic Archbishop Dr. [[John MacHale]] claimed the Cross rightfully belonged to Catholics, with Dean Charles Seymour of the Church of Ireland asserting a Protestant claim. Agreement was reached with the Cross erected half way between both Cathedrals and positioned so that it was visible from all main streets of the town. It was in the Square in the town centre in 1874.\n\nBy the late 1980s, it was evident that the decorative stone carving of the Cross was deteriorating due to weathering and pollution. Experts thought that there was a danger from traffic passing nearby. After lengthy discussions, the Office of Public Works removed the monument from the Square in April 1992. Following cleaning and minor restoration, the High Cross was re-erected in the south transept of St Mary's Cathedral, where it now is, near its original location. St Mary's Cathedral also houses the shaft of a third Cross fashioned from limestone. It is thought that all of the High Crosses would have marked the boundaries of the monastic section of Tuam.\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe [[Christian cross variants#Forms of the Cross|red latin cross]] is representative of Tuam's importance as an ecclesiastical centre. The double green [[flaunch]]es at the sides, represent the two hills or shoulders of Tuam's ancient name, ''Tuaim Dh\u00e1 Ghualainn''. The two crowns recall the High Kings, Tairrdelbach and Ruaidr\u00ed, who were based in Tuam. The broken chariot wheel being a reminder of the foundation of the monastic town when Iarlaithe's chariot wheel broke. The motto of the town, ''Tuath Thuama go Buan'', translates as \"Long Live the People of Tuam\".<ref>Glimpses of Tuam Since the Famine, J.A.

It was run by the [[Bon Secours Sisters|Bon Secours]] religious order of nuns. From its construction in the mid-19th century until the early 20th century, the building served as a [[workhouse]] for the poor. Excavations carried out between November 2016 and February 2017 that had been ordered by the [[Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation]], under Judge [[Yvonne Murphy]], found a \"significant\" quantity of human remains, aged from 35 foetal weeks to two to three years, interred in a vault with twenty chambers. The report said: \"The Commission has not yet determined what the purpose of this structure was but it appears to be related to the [[septic tank|treatment/containment of sewage and/or waste water]]. The Commission has also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose.\" Carbon dating confirmed that the remains date from the timeframe relevant to the operation of the Mother and Baby Home by the Bon Secours order. The Commission stated that it was shocked by the discovery and that it is continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.<ref name=\"MBHCOI20170303\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mbhcoi.ie/MBH.nsf/page/Latest%20News-en|title=Notice- 3rd March 2017|publisher=Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n{{Clear}}\n{{Weather box\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| location = Tuam (Airglooney) (1981-2010)\n| Jan high C = 8.7\n| Feb high C = 9.0\n| Mar high C = 10.7\n| Apr high C = 13.0\n| May high C = 15.7\n| Jun high C = 18.3\n| Jul high C = 19.4\n| Aug high C = 19.3\n| Sep high C = 17.3\n| Oct high C = 14.1\n| Nov high C = 11.4\n| Dec high C = 8.9\n| year high C =\n| Jan mean C = 5.2\n| Feb mean C = 5.5\n| Mar mean C = 6.9\n| Apr mean C = 8.4\n| May mean C = 10.9\n| Jun mean C = 13.4\n| Jul mean C = 15.1\n| Aug mean C = 14.9\n| Sep mean C = 12.9\n| Oct mean C = 10.1\n| Nov mean C = 7.8\n| Dec mean C = 5.5\n| year mean C =\n| Jan low C = 1.7\n| Feb low C = 2.0\n| Mar low C = 3.1\n| Apr low C = 3.9\n| May low C = 6.1\n| Jun low C = 8.5\n| Jul low C = 10.8\n| Aug low C = 10.6\n| Sep low C = 8.6\n| Oct low C = 6.0\n| Nov low C = 4.2\n| Dec low C = 2.0\n| year low C =\n|Jan sun = 42.70\n|Feb sun = 61.82\n|Mar sun = 93.31\n|Apr sun = 142.80\n|May sun = 169.26\n|Jun sun = 144.00\n|Jul sun = 126.79\n|Aug sun = 124.93\n|Sep sun = 104.70\n|Oct sun = 86.18\n|Nov sun = 52.80\n|Dec sun = 33.79\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = Met \u00c9ireann<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie/|title=Met \u00c9ireann Forecast - The Irish Meteorological Service|website=www.met.ie}}</ref>}}\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Tuam High Street 2009 09 14.jpg|thumb|The High Street in Tuam is the west-most section of the [[N83 road (Ireland)|N83]].]]\nTuam is served by the [[N17 road (Ireland)|N17 road]] (Galway to [[Sligo]]) and the [[N83 road (Ireland)|N83 road]] (to [[Ballyhaunis]]) as well as [[R332 road (Ireland)|R332]] and [[R347 road (Ireland)|R347]].

Below 72nd Street, Riverside Drive continues as Riverside Boulevard which stretches through [[Riverside South, Manhattan|Riverside South]] to 59th Street where it merges into the [[West Side Highway]].\n\nOnly a few stretches of Riverside Drive were built along an older road; due to the hilly terrain, Riverside Drive crosses a natural cleft in the bedrock at 87th Street on an iron [[viaduct]] and passes over [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]], Tiemann Place and [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]], and 158th Street on further viaducts. At Tiemann Place and 135th Street, and at 158th Street, an old alignment is present, also named Riverside Drive, while the viaduct portion or main route is officially named and signed \"Riverside Drive West\". The [[#Riverside Drive Viaduct|viaduct]] between Tiemann Place and 135th Street is called the \"Riverside Drive Viaduct\", as it is the most notable of the Riverside Drive viaducts.\n\nAt its north end, Riverside Drive merges with the northbound lanes of the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]].

It is shouldered by masonry approaches, though the span proper was made of open hearth medium steel, comprising twenty-six spans, or bays. The south and north approaches are of rock-faced [[Mohawk Valley]] limestone with [[Maine]] granite trimmings, the face work being of coursed ashlar. The girders over Manhattan Street (now [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]]) were the largest ever built at the time. The broad plaza effect of the south approach was designed to impart deliberate grandeur to the natural terminus of much of Riverside Drive's traffic as well as to give full advantage to the vista overlooking the Hudson River and [[New Jersey Palisades]] to the west.<ref>John W.

Stuart Williamson was the chief engineer for the viaduct, which constituted a feat of engineering technology. Despite the viaduct's important utilitarian role as a highway, the structure was also a strong symbol of civic pride, inspired by America's late 19th-century [[City Beautiful movement]]. The viaduct's original roadway, wide pedestrian walks and overall design were sumptuously ornamented, creating a prime example of public works that married form and function. An issue of the ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine in 1900 remarked that the Riverside Drive Viaduct's completion afforded New Yorkers \"a continuous drive of ten miles along the picturesque banks of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Harlem River]]s.\"<ref>[http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/Scientific%20American%201900%20to%201909/10/med/sci7211900.htm Riverside Drive Viaduct New York] Scientific American, 1900-07-21</ref>  The viaduct underwent a two-year-long reconstruction in 1961 and another in 1987.\n\n=={{Anchor|Structures}} Buildings and monuments==\n\n=== Residential buildings ===\n[[File:Fire Dpt monument 100 RSD jeh.JPG|thumb|left|225px|[[Firemen's Memorial (Manhattan)|Firemen's Memorial]] at 100th Street]]\nThe eastern side of Riverside Drive, once a series of luxuriously finished rowhouses interspersed with free-standing nineteenth century [[mansion]]s set in large lawns, today is lined with luxury apartment buildings and some remaining town houses from 72nd to 118th Streets.\n\nThe brick-faced Schwab House occupies the site of \"[[Riverside (house)|Riverside]]\", built for steel magnate [[Charles M.

Below 72nd Street, Riverside Drive continues as Riverside Boulevard which stretches through [[Riverside South, Manhattan|Riverside South]] to 59th Street where it merges into the [[West Side Highway]].\n\nOnly a few stretches of Riverside Drive were built along an older road; due to the hilly terrain, Riverside Drive crosses a natural cleft in the bedrock at 87th Street on an iron [[viaduct]] and passes over [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]], Tiemann Place and [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]], and 158th Street on further viaducts.

It is shouldered by masonry approaches, though the span proper was made of open hearth medium steel, comprising twenty-six spans, or bays. The south and north approaches are of rock-faced [[Mohawk Valley]] limestone with [[Maine]] granite trimmings, the face work being of coursed ashlar. The girders over Manhattan Street (now [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]]) were the largest ever built at the time. The broad plaza effect of the south approach was designed to impart deliberate grandeur to the natural terminus of much of Riverside Drive's traffic as well as to give full advantage to the vista overlooking the Hudson River and [[New Jersey Palisades]] to the west.<ref>John W.

The viaduct's original roadway, wide pedestrian walks and overall design were sumptuously ornamented, creating a prime example of public works that married form and function. An issue of the ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine in 1900 remarked that the Riverside Drive Viaduct's completion afforded New Yorkers \"a continuous drive of ten miles along the picturesque banks of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Harlem River]]s.\"<ref>[http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/Scientific%20American%201900%20to%201909/10/med/sci7211900.htm Riverside Drive Viaduct New York] Scientific American, 1900-07-21</ref>  The viaduct underwent a two-year-long reconstruction in 1961 and another in 1987.\n\n=={{Anchor|Structures}} Buildings and monuments==\n\n=== Residential buildings ===\n[[File:Fire Dpt monument 100 RSD jeh.JPG|thumb|left|225px|[[Firemen's Memorial (Manhattan)|Firemen's Memorial]] at 100th Street]]\nThe eastern side of Riverside Drive, once a series of luxuriously finished rowhouses interspersed with free-standing nineteenth century [[mansion]]s set in large lawns, today is lined with luxury apartment buildings and some remaining town houses from 72nd to 118th Streets.\n\nThe brick-faced Schwab House occupies the site of \"[[Riverside (house)|Riverside]]\", built for steel magnate [[Charles M.

The old prison was converted into the facility's hospital and in 1923 the island was officially renamed Quarantine Island.<ref name=\"private\"/>  Quarantine cases would be taken from the ships and monitored on the island for between one and two weeks before being allowed to progress with their journey.<ref name=\"travel\">{{cite web  | last = McIntyre  | first = Chris  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Islands near Zanzibar Town| work =   Zanzibar Travel Guide| publisher = Bradt Travel Guides  | year = 2006  | url = http://www.zanzibar-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1918 | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref>  The main disease that was monitored was [[Yellow Fever]].<ref name=\"tourist\"/>  \n\nShips typically only arrived in East Africa during the period running from December to March and so the island was usually empty of quarantine cases for a large part of the year.<ref name=\"private\"/>  During the empty period the island became a popular leisure resort for European people and local residents of Zanzibar.  A building, known as the European Bungalow, was built in the late 1890s to cater for the holiday makers although the number of visitors had to be limited as the only freshwater on the island was rainwater stored in underground tanks.<ref name=\"private\"/>  Large pits on the island remained from earlier coral mining for use as a construction material and these pits were cleaned out and used as swimming pools.<ref name=\"travel\"/>  A new complex of quarantine buildings was erected in the south-west of the island in 1931 which gave an improved quarantine capacity of 904 persons.<ref name=\"private\"/>\n\n== Giant tortoises ==\n[[File:Aldabra giant tortoises on Changuu.jpg|Giant tortoises on the Island|thumb]]\n[[File:Aldabra Giant Tortoise Geochelone gigantea edit1.jpg|thumb|right|An Aldabra giant tortoise from Zanzibar]]\nIn 1919 the British governor of [[Seychelles]] sent a gift of four [[Aldabra giant tortoise]]s to Changuu from the island of [[Aldabra]].<ref name=\"private\"/>  These tortoises bred quickly and by 1955 they numbered around 200 animals.  However people began to steal the tortoises for sale abroad as pets or for food and their numbers dropped rapidly.  By 1988 there were around 100 tortoises, fifty in 1990 and just seven by 1996.<ref name=\"travel\"/>  A further 80 hatchlings were taken to the island in 1996 to increase the numbers but 40 of them vanished.  The Zanzibar government, with assistance from the [[World Society for the Protection of Animals]] (Now known as [[World Animal Protection]]) built a large compound for the protection of the animals and by 2000 numbers had recovered to 17 adults, 50 juveniles and 90 hatchlings.  \n\nThe species is now considered [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] and has been placed on the [[IUCN Red List]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].  More tortoises, mainly juveniles, continue to be brought to the island from other locations for conservation.<ref name=\"travel\"/>  There is a dedicated foundation on the island which looks after the tortoises' welfare.<ref name=\"private\"/>  Visitors are able to observe and feed the tortoises.<ref name=\"travel\"/>\n\n== Changuu today ==\n\nThe island lost its use as a quarantine station, but remained in the ownership of the government who converted the newer quarantine buildings into a guesthouse.<ref name=\"private\"/>  This ceased to function but has since been reopened as a hotel by a private company.<ref name=\"travel\"/>  There are 15 holiday cottages in the northwest of the island as well as a tennis court, swimming pool and library and the old European Bungalow has been turned into a restaurant named after Mathews.<ref name=\"private\"/>  Freshwater is transported to the island via an underwater pipe from the Zanzibar mainland.<ref name=\"private\"/>  \n\nThe island is still owned by the government, which charges a US$4 entry fee.<ref name=\"travel\"/>  The old prison remains standing, providing shelter for some of the tortoises and the cells can be visited.<ref name=\"tourist\"/><ref name=\"planet\">{{cite web  | last = Planet Aware  | title = Changuu Island| url = http://www.planetware.com/zanzibar/changuu-island-tza-zza-chang.htm  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320073118/http://www.planetware.com/zanzibar/changuu-island-tza-zza-chang.htm|archivedate=2012-03-20|accessdate=2015-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Cite book|last1=Pouwels|first1=Randall L|title=Horn and Crescent: Cultural Change and Traditional Islam on the East African Coast, 800-1900|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1987|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iyw-_NMk0bgC|isbn=0-521-52309-5|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}.\n\n[[Category:Islands of Zanzibar]]\n[[Category:Zanzibar City]]\n[[Category:Prison islands]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "hatnote", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changuu"}

Therefore, a [[Great Coalition]] of parties formed in order to reform the political system.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=44}}\n\n===Influences leading to Confederation===\nSeveral factors influenced Confederation, both caused from internal sources and pressures from external sources.{{sfn|Martin|1995|pp=23-57}}<ref name=\"Martin1990\">{{cite book |first=Ged |last=Martin |title=The Causes of Canadian confederation |pages=[https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 12\u201324] |year=1990 |publisher=Acadiensis Press |isbn=978-0-919107-25-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/causesofcanadian0000unse/page/12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Smith |title=British Businessmen and Canadian Confederation Constitution-Making in an Era of Anglo-Globalization |location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2008}}</ref>\n;Internal causes that influenced Confederation:\n* political deadlock resulting from the current political structure\n* demographic pressure (population expansion)\n* economic nationalism and the promise of economic development\n* an inter-colony railroad which would improve trade, military movement, and transportation in general <ref>The Intercolonial Railway, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=4</ref>\n\n;External pressures that influenced Confederation:\n* cancellation of the [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] (a free trade policy whereby products were allowed into the United States without taxes or tariffs starting in 1854, which was then considered to be beneficial for Canada), in 1865 by the United States, partly as a revenge against Great Britain for unofficial support of the South in the American Civil War\n* the U.S. doctrine of \"[[manifest destiny]]\", the possible threat of invasion from the U.S.\u2014Canadians had fended off American invasions during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812\u2014increased by the [[Alaska Purchase]] of March 30, 1867, which was supported on the floor of the U.S. Senate (by Charles Sumner, among others) precisely in terms of taking over the remainder of North America from the British\n* the [[American Civil War]], which horrified Canadians and drove many away from any thought of republicanism, along with British actions during the war, and American reactions to Canada<ref>The American Dimension, ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=3</ref>\n* the [[Fenian raids]]\n* the [[Little Englander]] philosophy, whereby Britain no longer wanted to maintain troops in its colonies.\n* political pressure from British financiers who had invested money in the loss-making [[Grand Trunk Railway]]\n* The [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]\n\n===Ideological origins and philosophical dimensions===\n[[File:Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Confederation 1867.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Canadian Confederation, 1867.]]\nThere is extensive scholarly debate on the role of political ideas in Canadian Confederation. Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

Macdonald]] surprised the Atlantic premiers by asking if the Province of Canada could be included in the negotiations. The request was channelled through the Governor-General, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008}} After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada's legislature), Macdonald had led his [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] into the [[Great Coalition]] with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]]'s [[Parti bleu]] and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]'s [[Clear Grits]].{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}} Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Charlottetown Conference]] began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A. Macdonald presented arguments in favour of a union of the three colonies;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} [[Alexander Tilloch Galt]] presented the Province of Canada's proposals on the financial arrangements of such a union;{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=304}} and George Brown presented a proposal for what form a united government might take.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}} The Canadian delegation's proposal for the governmental system involved:\n# preservation of ties with Great Britain;\n# residual jurisdiction left to a central authority;\n# a bicameral system including a Lower House with representation by population (rep by pop) and an Upper House with representation based on regional, rather than provincial, equality;\n# responsible government at the federal and provincial levels;\n# the appointment of a [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian governor general]] by the [[British Crown]].\n\nOther proposals attractive to the politicians from the Maritime colonies were:\n# assumption of provincial debt by the central government;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# revenues from the central government apportioned to the provinces on the basis of population;{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=85}}\n# the building of an intercolonial railway to link Montreal and Halifax, giving Canada access to an ice-free winter port and the Maritimes easy access to Canada and [[Rupert's Land]].{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=307}}\n\nBy September 7, 1864, the delegates from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island gave a positive answer to the Canadian delegation, expressing the view the federation of all of the provinces was considered desirable if the terms of union could be made satisfactory{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}} and the question of Maritime Union was waived.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=87}}\n\nAfter the Conference adjourned on September 9, there were further meetings between delegates held at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and [[Fredericton]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=88}}{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}} These meetings evinced enough interest that the delegates decided to hold a second Conference.\n[[File:ThomasDArcyMcGee.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868]]\n\n====Delegates' reactions====\nOne of the most important purposes of the Charlottetown Conference was the introduction of Canadians to the leaders from the Maritime Provinces and vice versa. At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A. Macdonald asked [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Viscount Monck]], the [[Governor-General of the Province of Canada]] to invite delegates from the three Maritime provinces and Newfoundland to a conference with United Canada delegates. Monck obliged and the Conference went ahead at [[Quebec City]] in October 1864.\n\n[[File:QuebecConvention1864.jpg|thumb|left|Delegates at the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], October 1864]]\n\nThe Conference began on October 10, 1864, on the site of present-day Montmorency Park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |title=Quebec 2008 (400th Anniversary website), Government of Canada |publisher=Quebec400.gc.ca |date=November 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506011800/http://www.quebec400.gc.ca/histoires-stories/parc-montmorency-park-eng.cfm |archivedate=May 6, 2012}}</ref> The Conference elected [[\u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9]] as its chairman, but it was dominated by Macdonald. Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=98}} For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}} For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}}\n\nOn the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=100}} It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}} It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government\u2014federal or provincial\u2014that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=105}}\n\nAt the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.\n\nPrince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=107}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\n\"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation\" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S. E. Dawson and reprinted in a Quebec City newspaper during the Conference.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nAgain, reaction to the Quebec Conference varied depending on the political views of the critic.\n\n==== Constitutional scheme discussed in London====\nGeorge Brown was the first to carry the constitutional proposals to the British Government in London in December 1864, where it gave \"a most gracious answer to our constitutional scheme.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mackenzie |first=Alexander |title=The Life and Speeches of Hon.

The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.\n\nIn December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|4th Earl of Carnarvon]] presented each to [[Queen Victoria]] in private [[audience (meeting)|audience]],<ref name=\"Lady Carnarvon\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/a-constitutional-walk-for-canada-day/ |title=A Constitutional Walk for Canada Day |date=2017-06-30 |work=Lady Carnarvon |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref> as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bousfield|1991|p=16}}</ref> At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised anti-union forces in Nova Scotia he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the ''London Resolutions'', the conference's decisions were forwarded to the [[Colonial Office]].\n\nAfter breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the ''[[British North America Act (1867)|British North America Act]].'' The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the act at [[Highclere Castle]] alongside the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A.

July 1 is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]], [[Canada Day]], the country's official [[National Day]].\n\nThe form of the country's government was influenced by the American republic to the south. Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government. [[John A.

Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian [[Peter Busby Waite|Peter Waite]] derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as \"hot air\". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.<ref>See Introduction by Ged Martin in Peter B. Waite, ''The Confederation Debates in the Province of Canada, 1865 A Selection'' (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nIn 1987, political scientist Peter&nbsp;J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a [[Court Party]] ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] values of the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.<ref>Smith, Peter J. 1987. \"The Ideological Origins of Canadian Confederation\". Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne De Science Politique. 20, no. 1: 3\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn a 2000 journal article, historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian McKay]] argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a \"liberal order\" in northern North America.<ref>Mckay, I. 2000. \"The Liberal Order Framework: A Prospectus for a Reconnaissance of Canadian History\". CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW. 81: 617\u2013645.</ref> Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.<ref>Ducharme, Michel, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Constant. ''Liberalism and Hegemony: Debating the Canadian Liberal Revolution''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunchly individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the [[Statism|statist]] supporters of Confederation over their [[anti-statist]] opponents prepared the way for Sir John A. Macdonald's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the [[Intercolonial Railway|Intercolonial]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Pacific]] Railways.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2008. \"Toryism, Classical Liberalism, and Capitalism: The Politics of Taxation and the Struggle for Canadian Confederation\". ''The Canadian Historical Review''. 89, no. 1: 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, political scientist [[Janet Ajzenstat]] connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of [[John Locke]]. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.<ref>Ajzenstat, Janet.

The request was channelled through the Governor-General, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008}} After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada's legislature), Macdonald had led his [[Liberal-Conservative Party]] into the [[Great Coalition]] with [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]]'s [[Parti bleu]] and [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]]'s [[Clear Grits]].{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}} Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.{{sfn|Careless|1963|p=233}}\n\nThe [[Charlottetown Conference]] began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=83}}\n\nNo minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but we do know George-\u00c9tienne Cartier and John A.

At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another. [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=306}}\n\nGeorge Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel [[John Hamilton Gray (Prince Edward Island politician)|John Hamilton Gray]], he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found [[Prince Edward Island]]ers to be \"amazingly civilized\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=305}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\nReaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. \"From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the ''Victoria'' where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet.\"<ref>Fredericton ''Head Quarters'', of September 14, 1864, cited in Waite, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Quebec Conference===\n{{Main|Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Resolutions}}\nAfter returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, John A.

Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=98}} For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}} For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=99}}\n\nOn the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the other three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=100}} It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}} It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.{{sfn|Gwyn|2008|p=317}}\n\nThe delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government\u2014federal or provincial\u2014that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=105}}\n\nAt the end of the Conference, it adopted the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.\n\nPrince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in [[Land Purchase Act (1875)|buying out the holdings of absentee landlords]].{{sfn|Waite|1962|p=107}}\n\n====Press and popular reaction====\n\"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation\" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S.

The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.\n\nIn December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where the [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|4th Earl of Carnarvon]] presented each to [[Queen Victoria]] in private [[audience (meeting)|audience]],<ref name=\"Lady Carnarvon\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/a-constitutional-walk-for-canada-day/ |title=A Constitutional Walk for Canada Day |date=2017-06-30 |work=Lady Carnarvon |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref> as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bousfield|1991|p=16}}</ref> At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised anti-union forces in Nova Scotia he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the ''London Resolutions'', the conference's decisions were forwarded to the [[Colonial Office]].\n\nAfter breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the ''[[British North America Act (1867)|British North America Act]].'' The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the act at [[Highclere Castle]] alongside the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[John A.

Separate provinces were re-established under their current names of Ontario and Quebec. July 1 is now celebrated as a [[public holiday]], [[Canada Day]], the country's official [[National Day]].\n\nThe form of the country's government was influenced by the American republic to the south. Noting the flaws perceived in the American system, the Fathers of Confederation opted to retain a monarchical form of government. [[John A. Macdonald]], speaking in 1865 about the proposals for the upcoming Confederation of Canada, said:\n\n{{quote|By adhering to the monarchical principle we avoid one defect inherent in the [[Constitution of the United States]].

He is never looked up to by the whole people as the head and front of the nation. He is at best but the successful leader of a party. This defect is all the greater on account of the practice of reelection.

According to the Supreme Court of Canada, Canadian \"sovereignty was acquired in the period between its separate signature of the ''Treaty of Versailles'' in 1919 and the ''Statute of Westminster, 1931''\" long after Confederation in 1867.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/4737/index.do |title=Reference Re: Offshore Mineral Rights |year=1967 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of Canada]] |location=Ottawa |page=816}}</ref> Defence of British North America became a Canadian responsibility.<ref name=\"Dyck2011b\">{{cite book |first=Rand |last=Dyck |title=Canadian Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUOoN8e5Ps0C&pg=PA106 |date=March 2011 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-17-650343-7 |page=106}}</ref> Foreign policy remained in British hands, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remained Canada's highest court of appeal, and the constitution could be amended only in Britain.

Examples include [[Mount Confederation]], [[Confederation Square]], [[Confederation Building (disambiguation)|Confederation Building]], [[Confederation Park (disambiguation)|Confederation Park]], [[Confederation Station (OC Transpo)|Confederation Station]], [[Confederation Heights]], [[Confederation Bridge]], and so on. This is similar to the American practices of naming things \"Union\" and likewise the Australians with \"Federation\".\n\nIndigenous communities were absent or ignored in the process of Canadian confederation.<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Gettler |url=https://earlycanadianhistory.ca/2017/06/26/indigenous-policy-and-silence-at-confederation/ |title=Indigenous Policy and Silence at Confederation |work=Early Canadian History |date=June 26, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref> As a result of Confederation, the Government of Canada assumed the responsibility of the British Crown in treaty dealings with the First Nations. One result of this was the ''[[Indian Act]]'' of 1873, which has governed relations ever since. Canada was no longer a colony of the United Kingdom, but Canadian Confederation continued the conditions of colonialism, including resource grabbing, broken treaties, forced assimilation, culture loss, ecological destruction, heteropatriarchy, and intergenerational trauma inflicted by the hegemony of the Canadian state on indigenous nations that had been self-governing and ecologically sound.<ref>{{cite web |first=Moira |last=Macdonald |url=https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/six-indigenous-scholars-share-views-canada-150/ |title=Six Indigenous scholars share their view of Canada at 150 |work=University Affairs |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Gabrielle |last=Slowey |url=http://activehistory.ca/2016/07/19457/ |title=Confederation comes at a cost: Indigenous peoples and the ongoing reality of colonialism in Canada |work=Active History |date=July 8, 2016 |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Dakshana |last=Bascaramurty |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-150/canada-day-indigenous-perspectives-on-canada-150/article35498737/ |title='A horrible history': Four Indigenous views on Canada 150 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=June 30, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0306396813497877 |title=Neoliberal settler colonialism, Canada and the tar sands |journal=Race & Class |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=42\u201359 |year=2013 |last1=Preston |first1=Jen}}</ref> As the 20th century progressed, attention to the conditions of Canada's Indigenous peoples increased, which included the granting of full citizenship and voting rights to Indigenous Canadians.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Treaty rights were enshrined in the Canadian Constitution in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} A process of land claims settlements is ongoing.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} A Truth and Reconciliation Commission was struck to identify further measures to improve conditions.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Expo 67]]\n* [[150th anniversary of Canada]]\n* [[History of Canada]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of Canada]]\n* [[List of documents from the constitutional history of Canada]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bousfield |first=Arthur |first2=Garry |last2=Toffoli |title=Royal Observations |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd. |year=1991 |location=Toronto |url=https://archive.org/details/royalobservation0000bous |url-access=registration |quote=toffoli. |isbn=978-1-55002-076-2 |accessdate=March 7, 2010 |ref=CITEREFBousfield1991}}\n* {{cite book |first=J.

It begins with the sluggish and slow dinosaurs seen in the works of [[Charles R. Knight]], and then continues into analyzing reconstructions after the [[dinosaur renaissance]]. It points out that these reconstructions do not take the often bizarre [[Integumentary system|integumentary coverings]] of living animals into account, and that dinosaurs should be portrayed as natural animals that aren't 'shrink-wrapped' with many of the individual bones visible.\n\nThe remainder of the book consists of pictures with accompanying explanatory texts. Each picture displays a hypothetical adaptation that an extinct animal could have possessed, such as a [[plesiosaur]] disguised on the seafloor like a [[wobbegong]] or something that dinosaurs aren't usually shown doing, such as a sleeping ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. The texts describe the adaptations or habits and explain why they are plausible. Some of the entries are deliberately made to break a paleoartistic clich\u00e9, such as a ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'' walking alone without a predatory ''[[Deinonychus]]'' in sight (''Tenontosaurus'' is almost exclusively depicted in dinosaur art as the prey of ''Deinonychus'').\n\nThe second and last major section of the book is titled \"All Todays\", and depicts animals from the present day as if non-human paleontologists from the future were reconstructing them from fossilized skeletons. Some of the creatures are somewhat recognizable, like a [[vulture]] depicted with [[pterosaur]]-like wings; others are completely unrecognizable, like a [[rhinoceros]] reconstructed with no nose horn and a sail instead of a hump. By showing how completely extant animals might be misunderstood if known only from skeletal remains, ''All Yesterdays'' shows that our own conceptions of extinct animals are likely equally mistaken.\n\n==Reception==\n\n''All Yesterdays'' has received mostly very enthusiastic reviews from palaeontologists, and is perceived as introducing or popularising a new \"third wave\" approach to palaeoart after the classical period of Knight, [[Rudolph F. Zallinger|Zallinger]], [[Zden\u011bk Burian|Burian]] and others, and the more modern work of [[Robert T. Bakker|Bakker]], [[Gregory S. Paul|Paul]], [[Doug Henderson (artist)|Henderson]] and others.
