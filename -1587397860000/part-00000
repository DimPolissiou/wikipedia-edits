A number of families in the Myddfai district later claimed descent from Rhiwallon, the most notable member being [[Morgan Owen]], [[Bishop of Llandaff]], (d.1645), whones, F. \"An Approach to Welsh Geneaology\", ''Trans. of Hon.Soc. of Cymmrodor included in the [[Red Book of Hergest]], a 14th century manuscript collection, under the title ''Meddygon Myddfai''.<ref name=davies>Davies, P.

The girl brought a dowry of cattle, traditionally still kept at [[Dinefwr Castle]], Llandeilo,{{sfn|Davies|Jenkins|2008|p=128}} and other animals. But over time the man struck his wife three times: once, to remind her to fetch a horse, once to ask why she was crying at a wedding, and once when she laughed at a funeral. She had to return to the lake according to the promise, taking the cattle with her and leaving behind her husband and their three sons.\n\nThe sons often walked around the lake hoping to see their mother again. One day she appeared to the eldest son, Rhiwallon, presented him with a collection of medicinal prescriptions and instructions, and told him that his future and that of his descendants was to be a healer. She later returned and passed him information on herbs and plants to be used in cures. In due course Rhiwallon went to the court of [[Rhys Gryg]] of [[Deheubarth]], where he became a famous doctor, as did his own sons. \n\nThe legend was further elaborated by the story that some of Rhiwallon's descendants continued to practice medicine in the area until well into the 18th century. In particular the \"David Jones of Mothvey [Myddfai], surgeon\" (d.1719) and his eldest son John Jones, surgeon (d.1739) who are both commemorated on a gravestone now located in the porch of St Michaels, Myddfai, were identified by local folklore as the last two members of the family o direct male line. A second manuscript of herbal remedies attributed to Rhiwallon's family, which was brought to light in the early 19th century, was said to have been copied from one in the possession of John Jones. Descendants of the Jones family were still in the medical profession in the 20th century: in 1971 the ''Welsh Medical Gazette'' published the biographical profiles of two men, Surgeon-Major Edward Hopkins of [[Carreg Cennen Castle]] and Dr. John Powell of [[Tenby]], who both practised medicine and were descendants of David Jones of Myddfai.<ref name=ellisdavies>Ellis-Davidson, R.

There was a revival of interest in herbalism in 18th-century Wales and a number of people had made further copies, including the scholar, [[Edward Lhuyd]], Thomas Beynon of [[Llansadwrn|Greenmeadow]] and the bard and translator James Davies (Iago ab Dewi) of [[Llanllawddog]].<ref name=jones67>Jones, G.
