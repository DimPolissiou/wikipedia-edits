Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.

I remember going to the Anniversary at that hamlet which contained, I think, five houses and a church, and what did we see? From end to end, directly we got near the place, there were \u2013 not cabs, nothing half so grand \u2013 but carts, gigs, phaetons, waggons and all sorts of things except wheelbarrows upon which people could be brought. Then when you got to Mr Otter\u2019s place you found him beaming, all in his element. There was a large tent erected, and there I had the honour of shaking hands with the widow, just returned, of the late Rev John Hunt.

It stars [[Gary Busey]], [[Jodie Foster]], and [[Robbie Robertson]]. It also includes an early role for [[Fred Ward]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrankie ([[Gary Busey]]) and Patch ([[Robbie Robertson]]) are friends who work for the Great American Carnival,  a small-time carnival that tours the South. Frankie does an act as The Mighty Bozo, a character who sits in a [[dunk tank]] insulting the crowd, while Patch takes the money, points out the next mark to milk of his money to the Bozo, and distributes the balls outside. Patch is also the show's \"adjuster,\" hence his carny name, working with the owner of the carnival, Heavy St. John ([[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]]) negotiating deals with local officials and representatives of the local underworld to keep the show open.\n\nWhat it takes to keep the show open varies from town to town. In one town, it's making good on a city official's losses gambling on the midway and giving a city councilor a pile of free passes to the carnival. In another, it's compromising to allow the strippers to work,  but keeping the freak show closed. In a third, it involves providing an underworld boss's thug with a girl he fancies. He also works to maintain harmony among the carnies. Patch is good at his job of patching together the deals that keep the carnival rolling and keeping the peace on the lot, but never likes being played for a fool.\n\nAt one stand Donna ([[Jodie Foster]]), an independent 18-year-old bored with small town life, strikes up a friendship with Frankie and at his invitation follows the carny onto the carnival circuit. Patch is less than happy with her presence, and would like her out of the picture. To get Patch off her back, she takes a job with the cooch show as a \"side girl,\" a backup dancer who does not actually take her clothes off. Patch plants the suggestion with Delno, the carny who runs the girlie show, that Donna wants to \"work strong\"\u2014be a stripper, in other words. When she is thrust onstage, she freezes and a brawl ensues. Afterwards, she covers with Heavy to keep Patch out of it, taking the blame for Patch's setting her up to fail herself.\n\nFrankie gets her a job in the string joint, one of the midway games of chance, under the tutelage of Gerta ([[Meg Foster]]). Coached in how the game works, Donna is a big success, learning how to con the marks and get their money without giving herself to them (which is what the rubes really want). After one successful scamming, she winds up in bed with Patch and the two of them are caught [[in flagrante]] by Frankie, which puts a strain on his relationships with Patch and with Donna.\n\nWhile this is going on, a con run by Nails ([[Theodore Wilson]]) on Skeets, the local crime boss's main enforcer, goes badly wrong. Upset at losing their money, the local underworld's muscle boys wreck the Bozo Joint and kill On-Your-Mark ([[Elisha Cook]]), a carny who has been \"with it\" for more than fifty years and was planning to retire at the end of the season. Crime boss Marvin Dill ([[Bill McKinney]]) comes after the carnival intending to extort more money than they have already paid him. However, the carnies have had enough of his shaking them down. To avenge On-Your-Mark's death and get Dill off their backs, Patch, Frankie, Donna and Heavy run a scam on Mr. Dill involving the apparent beheading of Skeets. (They don't actually kill him, of course, but the effect used to terrify Dill and make him believe they ''did'' is simple and horrifyingly effective.)\n\nThe movie ends with the Great American Carnival continuing on its way, with Donna her own woman rather than Frankie's girlfriend, Frankie and the Patch reconciled, and the implication that in a season or two Heavy will retire and Patch will be the one running the show.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gary Busey]] as Frankie\n*[[Jodie Foster]] as Donna\n*[[Robbie Robertson]] as Patch\n*[[Meg Foster]] as Gerta\n*[[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Heavy St. John\n*[[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as On-Your-Mark\n*[[Tim Thomerson]] as Doubles\n*[[Theodore Wilson]] as Nails (as Teddy Wilson)\n*[[John Lehne]] as Skeet\n*[[Bill McKinney]] as Marvin Dill\n*[[Bert Remsen]] as Delno Baptiste\n*[[Woodrow Parfrey]] as W.

The land for Kiryas Joel was purchased in the early 1970s, and fourteen Satmar families settled there in the summer of 1974.

Many of these area residents see the expansion of the high-density residential, commercial village as a threat to the [[quality of life]] in the surrounding suburban communities due to [[suburban sprawl]]. Other concerns of the surrounding communities are the impact on local [[aquifer]]s and the projected increased volume of sewage reaching the county's [[sewerage treatment]] plants, already near capacity by 2005.\n\nOn August 11, 2006, residents of Woodbury voted by a 3-to-1 margin to incorporate much of the town as a village to constrain further annexation.

In the hotly contested 2013 Town Supervisors race, the Kiryas Joel bloc vote elected Harley Doles to the position of town supervisor. Kiryas Joel then sought to annex {{convert|510|acre}} of land into their village and the new Monroe Town Board has had no comment on this issue. In late 2014 village leadership proposed alternatively that a new village, to be called Gilios Kiryas Joel, be created on the {{convert|1140|acre}} south of the village within Monroe, including all the land it had wanted to annex.<ref name=\"New village proposal\">\n{{cite news|last=McKenna|first=Chris|title=Kiryas Joel may propose new village|url=http://www.recordonline.com/article/20141118/NEWS/141119333/101129/SEARCH|newspaper=Times-Herald Record|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=November 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206172423/http://www.recordonline.com/article/20141118/NEWS/141119333/101129/SEARCH|archive-date=2014-12-06|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nKiryas Joel played a major role in the 2006 Congressional election. The village was at that time in the congressional district represented by Republican [[Sue Kelly]]. Village residents had been loyal to Kelly in the past, but in 2006, voters were upset over what they saw as lack of adequate representation from Kelly for the village. In a bloc, Kiryas Joel swung around 2,900 votes to Kelly's Democratic opponent, [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]]. The vote in Kiryas Joel was one reason Hall carried the election, which he did by 4,800 votes.\n\n====Internal friction====\n\nJoel Teitelbaum had no son, and thus no clear successor. His nephew, Moses, was appointed by the community's committee members. But not all Satmar accepted Moses as the community leader, and even some of those that did questioned some of his actions and pronouncements. He responded by running the village in what they called an autocratic manner, through his deputy, Abraham Weider, who also served as mayor and president of the school board, as well as the main [[synagogue]] and [[yeshiva]] in the village.<ref name=\"1992 NYT story\">\n{{cite news|last=Winerip|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Winerip|title=Pious Village Is No Stranger To the Police|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/20/nyregion/on-sunday-pious-village-is-no-stranger-to-the-police.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 20, 1992|accessdate=May 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526055320/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/20/nyregion/on-sunday-pious-village-is-no-stranger-to-the-police.html|archive-date=2015-05-26|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the village forbade any property owner from selling or renting an apartment without its permission.

In one incident, troopers rode a school bus undercover to catch teenage boys [[stoning]] it; the boys later stoned a backup police cruiser when it arrived. One of Weider's nephews was among those arrested. He admitted that some of the village's young men took it upon themselves to act violently against dissidents because they could not bear to hear the grand rebbe criticized, although he said most of them were provoked to do so by dissidents.<ref name=\"1992 NYT story\" />\n\n\"Someone not following breaks down the whole system of being able to educate and being able to bring up our children with strong family values,\" Weider told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1992. \"Why do you think we have no drugs?

As you know I want to nominate seven people and I want these people to be the people.\"<ref name=\"1994 TNR story\" />\n\nOne dissident, Joseph Waldman, decided nevertheless to run on his own. He was made unwelcome at the synagogue, his children expelled from yeshiva, his car's tires slashed and his windows broken. Several hundred residents marched in the streets in front of his house chanting \"Death to Joseph Waldman!\" after posters calling for that fate were posted in the synagogue. After the election, in which Waldman finished last but still won 673 votes, 60 families who were known to have voted for him were barred from visiting their fathers' graves in the village cemetery that was owned by the rabbi and  banned from the synagogue (also, at the time, the village's only polling place). Waldman compared Teitelbaum to Iran's [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].<ref name=\"1994 TNR story\" />\n\nAfter the election, a state court ruled that Waldman's children had to be reinstated at the yeshiva, an action that was only taken after the judge held Teitelbaum in [[contempt of court|contempt]] and fined him personally. Friction continued as some of the dissidents banned from the synagogue circulated a petition calling for the polls to be moved to a neutral location. It originally drew 150 signatures, but all but 15 retracted their names after being threatened with [[excommunication]] by the grand rabbi, signing a document that they had not actually read the petition. One of the dissidents who signed was attacked while praying, and state troopers had to be called in again to disperse a mob that gathered on Waldman's lawn and broke his windows.<ref name=\"1992 NYT story\" />\n\n====Electoral fraud allegations====\n\nOn four occasions since 1990, the [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] ''[[Times-Herald Record]]'' has run lengthy [[investigative journalism|investigative]] articles on claims of [[electoral fraud]] in the village.

The board's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] commissioner, Sue Bahrens, initially agreed to appoint six to serve in the village, but later reversed that decision. The six sued the county, alleging [[religious discrimination]]; it responded that they had no [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue. Village Manager Gedalye Szegedin said the citizens were entitled to have inspectors who spoke Yiddish and understood their culture and customs. A [[New York Supreme Court|state court]] justice dismissed the discrimination claim but ruled that the United Monroe inspectors had been dismissed [[Standard of review#Arbitrary and capricious|arbitrarily and capriciously]] and were entitled to their appointments, but did not say when or where.<ref name=\"THR 2014 article\" />\n\nIn 2014, the newspaper examined claims by [[poll watcher]]s from United Monroe that they were intimidated and harassed by other poll watchers sympathetic to the village government when they tried to challenge voters whose signatures did not initially appear to match those on file during the previous year's elections for county offices.

Orange County [[District Attorney]] David Hoovler, elected along with Neuhaus, told the newspaper it was difficult to investigate the allegations since they could not verify the identity of either signer, if in fact there were two.

This disproportionate rate of hepatitis A infection was due in part to Kiryas Joel's high birth rate and crowded conditions among children, who bathed together in pools and ate from communal food at school. Children who were not infected with hepatitis A were separated into two groups, one receiving the experimental vaccine and the other receiving a placebo injection. Based on this study, the vaccine was declared 100 percent effective.

First created in 1990 by an act of the New York State Legislature to serve [[special education]] students in the almost entirely Hasidic Orange County village, the specifically carved-out district weathered a series of constitutional challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that the district violated the Constitution's requirement of separation between religion and state. But the state government rewrote the law allowing for creation of the district, finally finding statutory language able to overcome the constitutional barriers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nAccording to NYSED documents, the district served 123 students in the 2008\u20132009 school year and 217 students the previous year, all of them under special education.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hudson Valley|New York (state)|Judaism}}\n* [[New Square, New York]] \u2212 an all-Hasidic village in a neighboring county.\n* [[Kaser, New York]] \u2212 an all-Hasidic village in a neighboring county.\n* [[Kiryas Tosh|Kiryas Tosh, Quebec]] &ndash; an all-Hasidic community in Quebec.\n* [[Q\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131 Q\u0259s\u0259b\u0259]] \n* [[Shtetl]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A04E0DC1530F930A25753C1A96F958260 Hasidic Public School Loses Again Before U.S. Supreme Court, but Supporters Persist] (The New York Times, 1999)\n* [http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/09/state-and-municipal-politicos.html Kiryas Joel Ranks at Top of National List of Municipalities that Lobby the Federal Government] (Center for Responsive Politics' Capital Eye Blog, September 2009)\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/nyregion/29census.html 2006 Census]\n*{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/nyregion/16shun.html?_r=1&em&ex=1197954000&en=d1bdf10ddf8b0cb9&ei=5087%0A| title=A Display of Disapproval That Turned Menacing| work=The New York Times| author=DAN LEVIN| date= December 16, 2007 }}\n*Grumet, L., & Caher, J.

Many of these area residents see the expansion of the high-density residential, commercial village as a threat to the [[quality of life]] in the surrounding suburban communities due to [[suburban sprawl]]. Other concerns of the surrounding communities are the impact on local [[aquifer]]s and the projected increased volume of sewage reaching the county's [[sewerage treatment]] plants, already near capacity by 2005.\n\nOn August 11, 2006, residents of Woodbury voted by a 3-to-1 margin to incorporate much of the town as a village to constrain further annexation.

Villagers are perceived as voting in a solid [[Voting bloc|bloc]]. While this is not always the case, the highly concentrated population often does skew strongly toward one candidate or the other in local elections, making Kiryas Joel a heavily courted swing vote for whichever politician offers Kiryas Joel the most favorable environment for continued growth. In the hotly contested 2013 Town Supervisors race, the Kiryas Joel bloc vote elected Harley Doles to the position of town supervisor. Kiryas Joel then sought to annex {{convert|510|acre}} of land into their village and the new Monroe Town Board has had no comment on this issue. In late 2014 village leadership proposed alternatively that a new village, to be called Gilios Kiryas Joel, be created on the {{convert|1140|acre}} south of the village within Monroe, including all the land it had wanted to annex.<ref name=\"New village proposal\">\n{{cite news|last=McKenna|first=Chris|title=Kiryas Joel may propose new village|url=http://www.recordonline.com/article/20141118/NEWS/141119333/101129/SEARCH|newspaper=Times-Herald Record|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=November 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206172423/http://www.recordonline.com/article/20141118/NEWS/141119333/101129/SEARCH|archive-date=2014-12-06|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nKiryas Joel played a major role in the 2006 Congressional election. The village was at that time in the congressional district represented by Republican [[Sue Kelly]]. Village residents had been loyal to Kelly in the past, but in 2006, voters were upset over what they saw as lack of adequate representation from Kelly for the village. In a bloc, Kiryas Joel swung around 2,900 votes to Kelly's Democratic opponent, [[John Hall (New York politician)|John Hall]]. The vote in Kiryas Joel was one reason Hall carried the election, which he did by 4,800 votes.\n\n====Internal friction====\n\nJoel Teitelbaum had no son, and thus no clear successor. His nephew, Moses, was appointed by the community's committee members. But not all Satmar accepted Moses as the community leader, and even some of those that did questioned some of his actions and pronouncements. He responded by running the village in what they called an autocratic manner, through his deputy, Abraham Weider, who also served as mayor and president of the school board, as well as the main [[synagogue]] and [[yeshiva]] in the village.<ref name=\"1992 NYT story\">\n{{cite news|last=Winerip|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Winerip|title=Pious Village Is No Stranger To the Police|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/20/nyregion/on-sunday-pious-village-is-no-stranger-to-the-police.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 20, 1992|accessdate=May 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526055320/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/20/nyregion/on-sunday-pious-village-is-no-stranger-to-the-police.html|archive-date=2015-05-26|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the village forbade any property owner from selling or renting an apartment without its permission.

In one incident, troopers rode a school bus undercover to catch teenage boys [[stoning]] it; the boys later stoned a backup police cruiser when it arrived. One of Weider's nephews was among those arrested. He admitted that some of the village's young men took it upon themselves to act violently against dissidents because they could not bear to hear the grand rebbe criticized, although he said most of them were provoked to do so by dissidents.<ref name=\"1992 NYT story\" />\n\n\"Someone not following breaks down the whole system of being able to educate and being able to bring up our children with strong family values,\" Weider told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1992. \"Why do you think we have no drugs? If we lost respect for the Grand Rabbi, we lose the whole thing.\"<ref name=\"1992 NYT story\" />\n\nIn January 1990 the village held its first and, for a decade, only school board election. \"It's like this,\" Teitelbaum explained when he announced the names of seven handpicked candidates. \"With the power of the [[Torah]], I am here the authority in the rabbinical leadership ... As you know I want to nominate seven people and I want these people to be the people.\"<ref name=\"1994 TNR story\" />\n\nOne dissident, Joseph Waldman, decided nevertheless to run on his own. He was made unwelcome at the synagogue, his children expelled from yeshiva, his car's tires slashed and his windows broken. Several hundred residents marched in the streets in front of his house chanting \"Death to Joseph Waldman!\" after posters calling for that fate were posted in the synagogue. After the election, in which Waldman finished last but still won 673 votes, 60 families who were known to have voted for him were barred from visiting their fathers' graves in the village cemetery that was owned by the rabbi and  banned from the synagogue (also, at the time, the village's only polling place). Waldman compared Teitelbaum to Iran's [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].<ref name=\"1994 TNR story\" />\n\nAfter the election, a state court ruled that Waldman's children had to be reinstated at the yeshiva, an action that was only taken after the judge held Teitelbaum in [[contempt of court|contempt]] and fined him personally. Friction continued as some of the dissidents banned from the synagogue circulated a petition calling for the polls to be moved to a neutral location. It originally drew 150 signatures, but all but 15 retracted their names after being threatened with [[excommunication]] by the grand rabbi, signing a document that they had not actually read the petition. One of the dissidents who signed was attacked while praying, and state troopers had to be called in again to disperse a mob that gathered on Waldman's lawn and broke his windows.<ref name=\"1992 NYT story\" />\n\n====Electoral fraud allegations====\n\nOn four occasions since 1990, the [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] ''[[Times-Herald Record]]'' has run lengthy [[investigative journalism|investigative]] articles on claims of [[electoral fraud]] in the village. A 1996 article found that Kiryas Joel residents who were students at [[yeshiva]]s in [[Brooklyn]] had on many occasions apparently registered and voted in both the village and Brooklyn;<ref name=\"Jweek 1996 fraud story\">\n{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Eric|title=New York state investigates voter fraud among Satmar|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/4216/new-york-state-investigates-voter-fraud-among-satmar/|newspaper=[[The Jewish Week|6=New York Jewish Week]]|date=October 4, 1996|accessdate=November 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206044740/http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/4216/new-york-state-investigates-voter-fraud-among-satmar/|archive-date=2014-12-06|url-status=live}}\n</ref> a year later the paper reported that it had happened again. In 2001 [[absentee ballot]]s were apparently cast by voters who did not normally reside in the village. In some cases, ballots were cast by people who seemed to reside in [[Antwerp]], Belgium, without a set date of expected return and thus would not be allowed under New York law to vote in any election for state or local office. That article led to a county [[grand jury]] investigation in 2001, which concluded that while procedures were not followed and many mistakes were made, there was no evidence of deliberate intent to violate the law.<ref name=\"THR 2014 article\">\n{{cite news|last=McKenna|first=Chris|title=Inside the Kiryas Joel voting machine|url=http://www.recordonline.com/article/20141118/NEWS/141119333/101129/SEARCH|newspaper=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=October 26, 2014|accessdate=November 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206172423/http://www.recordonline.com/article/20141118/NEWS/141119333/101129/SEARCH|archive-date=2014-12-06|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nBefore the 2013 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[primary election|primary]] in that year's [[special election]] for the [[New York State Assembly|state assembly]] seat vacated by [[Annie Rabbitt]], later elected [[county clerk]], members of United Monroe, a local group that organizes and coordinates political opposition to the village and those local officials it believes support it, asked the county's [[Board of Elections]] to assign them to Kiryas Joel as [[election inspector]]s, who verify that voters are registered before allowing them to vote. The board's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] commissioner, Sue Bahrens, initially agreed to appoint six to serve in the village, but later reversed that decision. The six sued the county, alleging [[religious discrimination]]; it responded that they had no [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue. Village Manager Gedalye Szegedin said the citizens were entitled to have inspectors who spoke Yiddish and understood their culture and customs. A [[New York Supreme Court|state court]] justice dismissed the discrimination claim but ruled that the United Monroe inspectors had been dismissed [[Standard of review#Arbitrary and capricious|arbitrarily and capriciously]] and were entitled to their appointments, but did not say when or where.<ref name=\"THR 2014 article\" />\n\nIn 2014, the newspaper examined claims by [[poll watcher]]s from United Monroe that they were intimidated and harassed by other poll watchers sympathetic to the village government when they tried to challenge voters whose signatures did not initially appear to match those on file during the previous year's elections for county offices. They further alleged that election inspectors in the polling place, a banquet hall where 6,000 residents voted, sometimes gave the voters ballots before the signatures could be checked.<ref name=\"THR 2014 article\" />\n\nSome of the United Monroe poll watchers claimed that Langdon Chapman, an attorney for the Monroe town board, which they believe is controlled by members deferential to Kiryas Joel and its interests, was one of those who intimidated them. Coleman told the ''Record'' that while he had been at the banquet hall in question, he had only insisted that poll watchers state the reason for their challenges, as legally required, and had left after two hours. He was subsequently appointed [[county attorney]] (the lawyer who represents the county in civil matters) by new [[county executive]] Steve Neuhaus, whose margin of victory included all but 20 of the votes from the village.<ref name=\"THR 2014 article\" />\n\nAfter the election, United Monroe members found over 800 voters in Kiryas Joel whose signatures did not match those on file, in addition to 25 they had challenged at the polls, three of whom were later investigated by the county [[Sheriffs in the United States#New York|sheriff]]; the rest were considered unfounded. Orange County [[District Attorney]] David Hoovler, elected along with Neuhaus, told the newspaper it was difficult to investigate the allegations since they could not verify the identity of either signer, if in fact there were two. The ''Record'' attempted to contact some of those voters; the only one they reached hung up when asked about the election.<ref name=\"THR 2014 article\" />\n\n===Large families===\n[[Image:Grand Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, Satmar Rebbe, in synagogue, on Hanukkah, in Kiryas Joel, New York State.jpg|thumb|Grand Rabbi [[Aaron Teitelbaum]], celebrating [[Hanukah]] in the main synagogue in Kiryas Joel]]\n\nWomen in Kiryas Joel usually stop working outside the home after the birth of a second child.<ref name=\"NYT-Santos\"/>  Most families have only one income and many children.

This disproportionate rate of hepatitis A infection was due in part to Kiryas Joel's high birth rate and crowded conditions among children, who bathed together in pools and ate from communal food at school. Children who were not infected with hepatitis A were separated into two groups, one receiving the experimental vaccine and the other receiving a placebo injection. Based on this study, the vaccine was declared 100 percent effective. Merck licensed the vaccine in 1995 and it became available in 1996, after which the hepatitis A infection rate fell by 75 percent in the United States.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/05/22/sti-awareness-viral-hepatitis/|title=STD Awareness: Viral Hepatitis|date=22 May 2012|website=advocatesaz.org|accessdate=26 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926102310/http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/05/22/sti-awareness-viral-hepatitis/|archive-date=2017-09-26|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\n===Litigation===\nThe unusual lifestyle and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel has led to litigation on a number of fronts.

First created in 1990 by an act of the New York State Legislature to serve [[special education]] students in the almost entirely Hasidic Orange County village, the specifically carved-out district weathered a series of constitutional challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that the district violated the Constitution's requirement of separation between religion and state. But the state government rewrote the law allowing for creation of the district, finally finding statutory language able to overcome the constitutional barriers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nAccording to NYSED documents, the district served 123 students in the 2008\u20132009 school year and 217 students the previous year, all of them under special education.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hudson Valley|New York (state)|Judaism}}\n* [[New Square, New York]] \u2212 an all-Hasidic village in a neighboring county.\n* [[Kaser, New York]] \u2212 an all-Hasidic village in a neighboring county.\n* [[Kiryas Tosh|Kiryas Tosh, Quebec]] &ndash; an all-Hasidic community in Quebec.\n* [[Q\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131 Q\u0259s\u0259b\u0259]] \n* [[Shtetl]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A04E0DC1530F930A25753C1A96F958260 Hasidic Public School Loses Again Before U.S. Supreme Court, but Supporters Persist] (The New York Times, 1999)\n* [http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/09/state-and-municipal-politicos.html Kiryas Joel Ranks at Top of National List of Municipalities that Lobby the Federal Government] (Center for Responsive Politics' Capital Eye Blog, September 2009)\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/nyregion/29census.html 2006 Census]\n*{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/nyregion/16shun.html?_r=1&em&ex=1197954000&en=d1bdf10ddf8b0cb9&ei=5087%0A| title=A Display of Disapproval That Turned Menacing| work=The New York Times| author=DAN LEVIN| date= December 16, 2007 }}\n*Grumet, L., & Caher, J.
