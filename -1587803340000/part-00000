Well remembered is the selection of this country formed in the late 1940s acquiring the nickname of \"The Gold Shorties\". Throughout the '50s and '60s, they were very much the second strongest team in the CONCACAF zone behind Mexico, finishing runners-up in World Cup qualifying in the 1958, 1962 and 1966 qualifiers. Stars of the side during this period were Ruben Jimenez, Errol Daniels, Leonel Hernandez and Edgar Marin.\n\nHowever, at the end of the '60s their fortunes would decline as other teams in the region such as Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti, Trinidad & Tobago and Canada came to the fore. Although the majority of these participants have been short on points in their World Cup performances. During the 1970s and most of the 1980s, the Costa Rican team went unnoticed, and was absent from World Cups. Costa Rica failed to make the final round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying rounds until the 1986 qualifier. Currently its historical topscorer is [[Rolando Fonseca]] with 47 goals.\n\n===1980s===\nCosta Rica participated in 2 straight Summer Olympic Games, in Moscow 1980 and in Los Angeles 1984. In 1980, Costa Rica competed against Yugoslavia, Finland and Iraq, in Group D, losing all 3 games 2\u20133, 0\u20133 and 0\u20133 respectively.\nLos Angeles saw Costa Rica's first win in a worldwide international participation. Again in Group D, the Ticos played against The United States, Egypt and Italy. The game against The US ended in a loss, 0\u20133. The second game did not see much improvement, 1\u20134 against Egypt. But in the last game, against an Italian squad that included Walter Zenga, Pietro Vierchowod, Franco Baresi and Aldo Serena, Costa Rica prevailed 1\u20130, when midfielder Enrique Rivers scored a goal.\n\n===Qualifying to Italy 1990===\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n|  GK = [[Luis Gabelo Conejo|'''Gabelo Conejo''']]\n|  RB = [[German Chavarria|'''Chavarria''']]\n| RCB = [[Roger Flores|'''Flores (C)''']]\n| LCB = [[Mauricio Montero|'''Montero''']]\n|  LB = [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Chaves|'''Chaves''']]\n| LDM = [[R\u00f3nald Gonz\u00e1lez Brenes|'''Gonz\u00e1lez''']]\n| RDM = [[Hector Marchena|'''Marchena''']]\n|  AM = [[Juan Cayasso|'''Cayasso''']]\n|  LM = [[\u00d3scar Ram\u00edrez (footballer)|'''Ram\u00edrez''']]\n|  RM = [[Roger G\u00f3mez|'''G\u00f3mez''']]\n|  CF = [[Claudio Jara|'''Jara''']]\n| caption = Team that played against Scotland in the World Cup Italy 1990\n}}\n{{main|1990 FIFA World Cup}}\nAfter a great campaign during the CONCACAF Championship in 1989, Costa Rica won its first ticket to the finals of a World Cup where they made an outstanding performance by beating Scotland and Sweden in the first round. Before these two achievements came to happen, the team had to suffer a hard process to qualify. In order to advance to the qualifying group stage, two games against the Panama national football team had to be won. Costa Rica suffered against the Panamanians in the first game at the Alejandro Morera Soto Stadium in Alajuela, which ended up taking a local one to one tie (1-1). The second game took place at the Revolution (renamed Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez) Stadium, where Costa Rica won two to zero (2-0) with goals by midfielder Juan Arnoldo Cayasso and forward Hern\u00e1n Medford; this results meant that Costa Rica was part of the 1990 World Cup qualifying group stage.\n\nCosta Rica started the group stage with a defeat in Guatemala by 1 to 0. Costa Rica won against Guatemala two to zero (2\u20131) as locals in the game back home, R\u00f3ger Flores and [[Evaristo Coronado]] scored for the team. In the next game, Costa Rica then managed to defeat the U.S. as local one to zero (1\u20130); Gilberto Rodden scored for the team.  but Costa Rica found defeat in the next game against the U.S. one to zero (1\u20130) at St. Louis&nbsp;\u2013 Missouri. The following game took placed at Trinidad and Tobago against their national football team which ended in a tie 1 to 1, with a goal scored by was forward Evaristo Coronado. Costa Rica also won the game back home against Trinidad and Tobago with a goal by [[Juan Arnoldo Cayasso]]. A substantial away win was next for the Ticos in El Salvador at the Cuscatl\u00e1n by 2\u20134, with goals from Carlos Mario Hidalgo, Juan Arnoldo Cayasso and a double from [[Leonidas Flores]].\n\nFinally, in the last game, a victory over El Salvador in San Jose by 1 goal to 0 signified a trip to the 1990 Fifa World Cup.

The first group stage began with an unexpected defeat to Barbados 1\u20132. After this humiliating loss, Costa Rica proceeded to beat the United States at the [[Estadio Ricardo Saprissa Aym\u00e1|Ricardo Saprissa Stadium]] 2\u20131, with goals from [[Rolando Fonseca]] and [[Hern\u00e1n Medford]].

Its away kit historically was a Juventus-style Black and White Striped Jersey with white shorts and white socks, due to these colors being the ones of CS La Libertad, one of the oldest clubs in Costa Rica. However, after 1997, the striped kit was replaced by a white kit with blue shorts. Starting in 2015, Boston based sportswear company [[New Balance]] will be the kit provider of the national team, taking over for Italian company [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]].\n\n===Kit

Costa Rica's national football team has the [[World Football Elo Ratings#Strongest teams since the mid to late 1960s|all-time highest average Football Elo Ranking in Central America]] with 1597.1, and the [[World Football Elo Ratings#All-time highest ratings|all-time highest Football Elo Ranking in Central America]], with 1806 in 2014.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the team has continuously been visible as a solidly competitive side, with a prominent performance in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy, making it to the [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout stage]] in their debut after finishing second in their group during the first phase, below [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. They also managed to qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]s.\n\nIn [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], Costa Rica achieved their best performance in history by [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group D|finishing first in their group]] that consisted of three former World Cup champions: [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and [[England national football team|England]]. During round 16 they defeated [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 5\u20133 via a penalty shootout after a 1\u20131 draw. Moreover, during their match against the Greek team, [[Keylor Navas]] saved more than 15 shots.

Well remembered is the selection of this country formed in the late 1940s acquiring the nickname of \"The Gold Shorties\". Throughout the '50s and '60s, they were very much the second strongest team in the CONCACAF zone behind Mexico, finishing runners-up in World Cup qualifying in the 1958, 1962 and 1966 qualifiers. Stars of the side during this period were Ruben Jimenez, Errol Daniels, Leonel Hernandez and Edgar Marin.\n\nHowever, at the end of the '60s their fortunes would decline as other teams in the region such as Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti, Trinidad & Tobago and Canada came to the fore. Although the majority of these participants have been short on points in their World Cup performances. During the 1970s and most of the 1980s, the Costa Rican team went unnoticed, and was absent from World Cups. Costa Rica failed to make the final round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying rounds until the 1986 qualifier. Currently its historical topscorer is [[Rolando Fonseca]] with 47 goals.\n\n===1980s===\nCosta Rica participated in 2 straight Summer Olympic Games, in Moscow 1980 and in Los Angeles 1984. In 1980, Costa Rica competed against Yugoslavia, Finland and Iraq, in Group D, losing all 3 games 2\u20133, 0\u20133 and 0\u20133 respectively.\nLos Angeles saw Costa Rica's first win in a worldwide international participation. Again in Group D, the Ticos played against The United States, Egypt and Italy. The game against The US ended in a loss, 0\u20133. The second game did not see much improvement, 1\u20134 against Egypt. But in the last game, against an Italian squad that included Walter Zenga, Pietro Vierchowod, Franco Baresi and Aldo Serena, Costa Rica prevailed 1\u20130, when midfielder Enrique Rivers scored a goal.\n\n===Qualifying to Italy 1990===\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n|  GK = [[Luis Gabelo Conejo|'''Gabelo Conejo''']]\n|  RB = [[German Chavarria|'''Chavarria''']]\n| RCB = [[Roger Flores|'''Flores (C)''']]\n| LCB = [[Mauricio Montero|'''Montero''']]\n|  LB = [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Chaves|'''Chaves''']]\n| LDM = [[R\u00f3nald Gonz\u00e1lez Brenes|'''Gonz\u00e1lez''']]\n| RDM = [[Hector Marchena|'''Marchena''']]\n|  AM = [[Juan Cayasso|'''Cayasso''']]\n|  LM = [[\u00d3scar Ram\u00edrez (footballer)|'''Ram\u00edrez''']]\n|  RM = [[Roger G\u00f3mez|'''G\u00f3mez''']]\n|  CF = [[Claudio Jara|'''Jara''']]\n| caption = Team that played against Scotland in the World Cup Italy 1990\n}}\n{{main|1990 FIFA World Cup}}\nAfter a great campaign during the CONCACAF Championship in 1989, Costa Rica won its first ticket to the finals of a World Cup where they made an outstanding performance by beating Scotland and Sweden in the first round. Before these two achievements came to happen, the team had to suffer a hard process to qualify. In order to advance to the qualifying group stage, two games against the Panama national football team had to be won. Costa Rica suffered against the Panamanians in the first game at the Alejandro Morera Soto Stadium in Alajuela, which ended up taking a local one to one tie (1-1). The second game took place at the Revolution (renamed Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez) Stadium, where Costa Rica won two to zero (2-0) with goals by midfielder Juan Arnoldo Cayasso and forward Hern\u00e1n Medford; this results meant that Costa Rica was part of the 1990 World Cup qualifying group stage.\n\nCosta Rica started the group stage with a defeat in Guatemala by 1 to 0. Costa Rica won against Guatemala two to zero (2\u20131) as locals in the game back home, R\u00f3ger Flores and [[Evaristo Coronado]] scored for the team. In the next game, Costa Rica then managed to defeat the U.S. as local one to zero (1\u20130); Gilberto Rodden scored for the team.  but Costa Rica found defeat in the next game against the U.S. one to zero (1\u20130) at St. Louis&nbsp;\u2013 Missouri. The following game took placed at Trinidad and Tobago against their national football team which ended in a tie 1 to 1, with a goal scored by was forward Evaristo Coronado. Costa Rica also won the game back home against Trinidad and Tobago with a goal by [[Juan Arnoldo Cayasso]]. A substantial away win was next for the Ticos in El Salvador at the Cuscatl\u00e1n by 2\u20134, with goals from Carlos Mario Hidalgo, Juan Arnoldo Cayasso and a double from [[Leonidas Flores]].\n\nFinally, in the last game, a victory over El Salvador in San Jose by 1 goal to 0 signified a trip to the 1990 Fifa World Cup. Pastor Fernandez scored the lone goal. Costa Rica finished first with 11 points in the pentagonal and the United States in second also with 11 points in 8 games respectably both qualifying, but Costa Rica first on goal difference. Mexico was disqualified from this qualifier because of youth player age tampering.\n\nIn the World Cup finals, Costa Rica was second in their group behind Brazil, but lost in the round of 16 to Czechoslovakia.\n\n{{Main|1989 CONCACAF Championship}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n!width=165|Qualifying\n!width=25|{{Abbr| Pld | Played}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| W | Wins}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| D | Drawn}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| L | Lost}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| GF | Goals for}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| GA | Goals against}}\n!width=25|{{Abbr| GD | Goal difference}}\n!width=25|{{Tooltip | Pts | Points}}\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|CRC}}\n|'''8'''||'''5'''||'''1'''||'''2'''||'''10'''||'''6'''||'''+4'''||'''11'''\n|- style=\"background:#cfc;\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|USA}}\n|8||4||3||1||6||3||+3||11\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|TRI}}\n|8||3||3||2||7||5||+2||9\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|GUA}}\n|6||1||1||4||4||7||\u22123||3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|SLV}}\n|6||0||2||4||2||8||\u22126||2\n|}\n\n{{Main|1990 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n{{1990 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group C}}\n\n===1990s and early 2000s===\nAfter its brilliant performance in the Italian summer, the national team failed to qualify for World Cup USA 1994 and France 1998 due to lack of planning and poor results.

This included victories against favorites Mexico and the United States. During the World Cup the results were mixed, losing to Brazil (tournament champion) 5\u20132 (only team to score 2 goals against Brazil at this World Cup), tying with Turkey (third in the championship) 1\u20131 and beating China 2\u20130. Costa Rica finished in third place in their group, behind Turkey on goal difference. The match against Brazil is remembered as one of the most exciting matches of the tournament.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the qualifiers, though, Costa Rica started with many ups and downs, first in command of Brazilian coach Gilson Nunes Sequeira and then with another fellow Brazilian naturalized to Costa Rican [[Alexandre Guimar\u00e3es]]. The first group stage began with an unexpected defeat to Barbados 1\u20132. After this humiliating loss, Costa Rica proceeded to beat the United States at the [[Estadio Ricardo Saprissa Aym\u00e1|Ricardo Saprissa Stadium]] 2\u20131, with goals from [[Rolando Fonseca]] and [[Hern\u00e1n Medford]]. Then they beat Guatemala in the Morera Soto Alajuela by 2\u20131, with two goals from Paulo Wanchope and defeated Barbados at the Ricardo Saprissa 3\u20130, with goals from Juan Soto, Ronaldo Fonseca and Hernan Medford. After this good run, Costa Rica's level decreased and took a scoreless match against the United States, then lost to Guatemala in Mazatenango 2\u20131. This result forced a playoff against Guatemala in Miami, Florida. The match was won 5\u20132 by Costa Rica with two goals from Ronaldo, Fonseca, one from [[Paulo Wanchope]], one from Reynaldo Parks and Jafeth Soto.\n\nCosta Rica displayed a fine offensive form with a rather solid front line,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} thanks to their new coach, Alexandre Guimaraes. This display of football evidenced itself during the final hexagonal round, although it began with a draw against Honduras at the Ricardo Saprissa 2\u20132, with goals from Rolando Fonseca and Rodrigo Cordero. Then Costa Rica defeated Trinidad and Tobago 3\u20130 at the Morera Soto. Their only loss in this final round came thanks to the U.S., who defeated Costa Rica 1\u20130. Afterwards, Costa Rica bounced back with a huge win against Mexico in Mexico city 1\u20132, which is usually referred as the ''[[Aztecazo]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00a1Aztecazo!|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2001/junio/17/home.html|website=[[La Naci\u00f3n (San Jos\u00e9)|Naci\u00f3n.com]]|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> with goals from Rolando Fonseca and Hernan Medford. Morale was high after this game, and Costa Rica beat Jamaica 2\u20131 in Alajuela. Again, Costa Rica came away with an away win over Honduras in Tegucigalpa 2\u20133, goals scored by Paulo Wanchope, Rolando Fonseca and Mauricio Solis. A crucial away win in Port of Spain against Trinidad and Tobago 2\u20130, with two goals from [[R\u00f3nald G\u00f3mez]], meant Costa Rica was just 3 points away from qualification to the World Cup. Costa Rica sealed their qualification to Korea/Japan in an emotional match against the U.S. by beating them 2\u20130 in the Saprissa, with a double from Rolando Fonseca. The final 2 games were uneventful, as Costa Rica managed a goalless tie with Mexico at the Ricardo Saprissa and defeated already-eliminated Jamaica 0\u20131, using subs and reserves. Costa Rica finished first in that hexagonal round with 23 points in 10 games.\n\nCosta Rica were put in Pot D for the World Cup and were put into [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] with Brazil, [[China national football team|China PR]], and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. Their campaign started in Gwangju, where the Ticos took down China 0\u20132. In their second game versus Turkey in Incheon, Costa Rica was losing late in the 2nd half 0\u20131, only to be saved by a late 86th-minute goal by Winston Parks to end it in a 1\u20131 draw. In the final group game versus Brazil, Costa Rica fought a 0\u20133 deficit to go 2\u20133 early in the 2nd half, only to be shut down by 2 goals in 3 minutes to lose 2\u20135. As a result, thanks to this loss against Brazil and Turkey's 3\u20130 victory over China, caused both Costa Rica and Turkey tied with 4 points, but Turkey advanced on the Goal Difference with a +2 goal difference over Costa Rica's \u22121 goal difference, eliminating the Ticos from the World Cup.\n{{Main|2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF final round}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"|Team\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip| Pld | Played}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip| W | Won}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip| D | Drawn}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip| L | Lost}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip| GF | Goals for}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip| GA | Goals against}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip| GD | Goal difference}}\n!width=\"10\"|{{Tooltip| Pts | Points}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|CRC}}\n|'''10'''||'''7'''||'''2'''||'''1'''||'''17'''||'''7'''||'''10'''||'''23'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|MEX}}\n|10||5||2||3||16||9||7||17\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|USA}}\n|10||5||2||3||11||8||3||17\n|- style=\"text-align: center; background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|HON}}\n|10||4||2||4||17||17||0||14\n|- style=\"text-align: center; background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|JAM}}\n|10||2||2||6||7||14||\u22127||8\n|- style=\"text-align: center; background:#f5f5f5;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|TRI}}\n|10||1||2||7||5||18||\u221213||5\n|}\n\n{{Main|2002 FIFA World Cup Group C}}\n{{2002 FIFA World Cup Group C|expanded=yes}}\n\n===Germany 2006 World Cup Qualifiers===\n{{main|2006 FIFA World Cup}}\n\nIn 2006, Costa Rica had an uneven season but managed to make the qualification to the World Cup. On 9 June 2006, Costa Rica made its debut in the opening match in Munich against the host German squad, losing the match 4\u20132.\n\nHowever, the bad performance in that game did not translate over to the other games, where they fell 0\u20133 against Ecuador, and 1\u20132 against Poland.\nThis time they also started the journey with ups and downs. First in command U.S. coach Steve Sampson, who was separated after qualifying with doubts over Cuba in the preliminary phase, Both these games results were ties. First in Havana 2\u20132, with goals Douglas Sequeira and \u00c1lvaro Sabor\u00edo, and then in the second game at the Morera Soto in Alajuela 1\u20131.

Then they visited Guatemala and lost 1\u20132. Bounced back against Canada at the Saprissa 1\u20130, with a goal from [[Paulo Wanchope]]. Then a resounding triumph over Guatemala in Tibas 5 to 0, a [[hat-trick]] from Paulo Wanchope, single goals from Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez and Rolando Fonseca resounding.

Costa Rica advanced to the hexagonal winning their group. In the final round they started with a defeat at the Saprissa against Mexico by 1\u20132. Paulo Wanchope's goal was not enough.

The Costa Rican Football Federation appealed the match due to inclement weather in Denver, but FIFA rejected the appeal as being without basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/26/sport/football/united-states-costa-rica-mexico-football/index.html|title=U.S. win stands as Costa Rica appeal blown away|date=26 March 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> Despite feeling aggrieved by the meteorological conditions, Costa Rica would again fall to the US 1\u20130 in the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] that June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/general/eye-on-sports/22794673/us-downs-costa-rica-10-in-gold-cup-group-stage-advances-to-quarters|title=U.S. downs Costa Rica 1\u20130 in Gold Cup group stage, advances to quarters|work=CBSSports.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> On 26 March, Costa Rica won at home 2\u20130 against Jamaica. In June, Costa Rica won 1\u20130 against Honduras, tied 0\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca against Mexico and won at home 2\u20130 against Panama. In September, Costa Rica won 3\u20131 against the United States in [[Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica (2011)|Estadio Nacional]] in San Jos\u00e9.\n\nOn 10 September Costa Rica tied with Jamaica. Goals were scored by Randall Brenes at the 73rd minute and by Jermain Anderson at the 90th minute. Despite losing its lead,  Costa Rica qualified to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, with two games to spare. After a 1\u20130 loss at Honduras and 2\u20131 win over Mexico in October, Costa Rica finished second in the final CONCACAF qualifying round table behind the [[United States Soccer|United States]], with five home wins, three draws and two losses.\n\nIn December 2013, Costa Rica was drawn in Group D against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[England national football team|England]], and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. Costa Rica were widely perceived as minnows who had no hope in a group against three former World Cup champion nations. They were given extremely unlikely odds of 2500 to 1 to win the tournament. Amazingly, they ended up topping the group with two wins against Uruguay and Italy and a 0\u20130 draw with England. In the round of 16 they beat Greece 5\u20133 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw,  seeing them through to the quarterfinals for the first time ever. At the quarterfinals, the Costa Ricans fought the Netherlands to a 0\u20130 draw after extra time; the game then went to penalties in which Costa Rica lost 4\u20133 to the Netherlands. After the tournament, Costa Rica rose 12 places in the [[FIFA World Rankings]], reaching 16th place. In an interview by former Federation member Farabundo ''Fidel'' Calder\u00f3n cited their long journey, started in 2007, as the reason of their achievement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20140707/futbol/el-exito-de-costa-rica-se-debe-a-la-paciencia-segun-exmundialista-gonzalez_54410863402.html|title=El \u00e9xito de Costa Rica se debe a la paciencia, seg\u00fan exmundialista Gonz\u00e1lez|author=|date=|work=mundodeportivo.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n{{Main|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 CONCACAF Fourth Round}}\n{{:2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013  CONCACAF Fourth Round|showteam=CRC}}\n\n===Russia 2018 World Cup Qualifying and Tournament===\nThe Ticos' qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] started with a bye to the fourth round, where they won five games and drew one, letting them advance to the fifth round. There, they finished second behind Mexico. They won four matches, drew another four and lost two.\n\nIn December 2017, Costa Rica was drawn in Group E against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]]. The team expected to repeat their surprise performance in 2014, due to the fact that many of the key players from the 2014 tournament were set to return. However, 2018 was to result in a disappointing exit at the group stage. Costa Rica lost both of their first two games, failing to score a single goal until a 2-2 draw with Switzerland.\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification&nbsp;\u2013 CONCACAF Fifth Round}}\n{{2018

Its away kit historically was a Juventus-style Black and White Striped Jersey with white shorts and white socks, due to these colors being the ones of CS La Libertad, one of the oldest clubs in Costa Rica. However, after 1997, the striped kit was replaced by a white kit with blue shorts.

However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. A ''textile'' is any material made of interlacing fibres, including [[carpet]]ing and [[geotextile]]s. A ''fabric'' is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.). ''Cloth'' may be used synonymously with ''fabric'' but is often a  piece of fabric that has been processed.\n[[File:Otavalo Artisan Market - Andes Mountains - South America - photograph 001.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alpaca]] textiles at the [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]] Artisan Market in the Andes Mountains, Ecuador]]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'textile' is from [[Latin]], from the adjective ''textilis'', meaning 'woven',  from ''textus'', the past participle of the verb ''texere'',  'to weave'.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/textile|title=Textile|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe word 'fabric' also derives from Latin, most recently from the Middle [[French language|French]] ''fabrique'', or 'building, thing made', and earlier as the Latin ''fabrica'' 'workshop; an art, trade; a skilful production, structure, fabric', which is from the Latin ''faber'', or 'artisan who works in hard materials', from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''dhabh-'', meaning 'to fit together'.<ref>{{OEtymD|fabric|accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref>\n\nThe word 'cloth' derives from the [[Old English]] ''cla\u00f0'', meaning a ''cloth, woven or felted material to wrap around one'', from Proto-Germanic ''kalithaz'' (compare O.Frisian 'klath', Middle [[Dutch language|Dutch]] 'cleet', Dutch 'kleed', Middle High German 'kleit', and German 'kleid', all meaning \"garment\").<ref>{{OEtymD|cloth|accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of clothing and textiles}}\n[[File:Banton Burial Cloth.JPG|thumb|The Banton Cloth, the oldest existing example of warp [[ikat]] in Southeast Asia, displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].

In the household they are used in [[carpet]]ing, upholstered [[furniture|furnishings]], [[window shade]]s, [[towel]]s, coverings for tables, beds, and other flat surfaces, and in [[art]]. In the workplace they are used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses include [[flag]]s, [[backpack]]s, [[tent]]s, [[Net (device)|nets]], [[handkerchief]]s, cleaning [[wikt:rag|rags]], [[transportation]] devices such as [[balloon]]s, [[kite flying|kites]], [[sail]]s, and [[parachute]]s; textiles are also used to provide strengthening in [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] and industrial [[geotextile]]s. Textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as [[sewing]], [[quilting]]  and [[embroidery]].\n\nTextiles for industrial purposes, and chosen for characteristics other than their appearance, are commonly referred to as ''[[technical textiles]].'' Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g. implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for [[crop protection]]), protective clothing (e.g. against heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing, against molten metals for welders, stab protection, and [[bullet]] proof vests). In all these applications stringent performance requirements must be met. Woven of threads coated with [[zinc oxide]] [[nanowire]]s, laboratory fabric has been shown capable of \"self-powering nanosystems\" using vibrations created by everyday actions like wind or body movements.<ref>{{cite news|author=Keim, Brandon |title=Piezoelectric Nanowires Turn Fabric Into Power Source |url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/piezoelectric-n.html |date=February 13, 2008 |work=Wired News |publisher=Cond\u00e9Net |accessdate=2008-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215001128/http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/piezoelectric-n.html |archivedate=February 15, 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Yong Qin, Xudong Wang & Zhong Lin Wang|title=Letter/abstract: Microfibre\u2013nanowire hybrid structure for energy scavenging|journal=Nature|volume=451|pages=809\u2013813|doi=10.1038/nature06601|date=October 10, 2007|pmid=18273015|issue=7180|df=}} cited in {{cite web|title=Editor's summary: Nanomaterial: power dresser|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/edsumm/e080214-06.html|work=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-13|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185507/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/edsumm/e080214-06.html|archivedate=February 15, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Sources and types ==\nTextiles are made from many materials, with four main sources: animal ([[wool]], [[silk]]), plant ([[cotton]], [[flax]], [[jute]], [[bamboo textile|bamboo]]), mineral ([[asbestos]], [[glass (fiber)|glass fibre]]), and synthetic ([[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]], [[rayon]]). The first three are natural. In the 20th century, they were supplemented by artificial fibres made from [[petroleum]]. Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest [[microfibre]] made of strands thinner than one [[Units_of_textile_measurement#Denier|denier]] to the sturdiest [[canvas]]. [[Textile manufacturing terminology]] has a wealth of descriptive terms, from light [[gauze]]-like [[Gossamer (fabric)|gossamer]] to heavy [[grosgrain]] cloth and beyond.\n\n=== Animal ===\nAnimal textiles are commonly made from [[hair]], [[fur]], [[skin]] or [[silk]] (in the silkworms case).\n\n[[Wool]] refers to the hair of the domestic [[sheep]] or [[goat]], which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a [[wax]] mixture known as [[lanolin]] (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Woollen]] refers to a bulkier yarn produced from carded, non-parallel fibre, while [[worsted]] refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibers which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. [[Cashmere wool|Cashmere]], the hair of the Indian [[cashmere goat]], and [[mohair]], the hair of the North African [[angora goat]], are types of wool known for their softness.\n\nOther animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, [[Vicu\u00f1a|vicu\u00f1a wool]], llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[poncho]]s, [[blanket]]s, and other warm coverings. [[Angora wool|Angora]] refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the [[angora rabbit]]. [[Qiviut]] is the fine inner wool of the [[muskox]].\n\n[[Wadmal]] is a coarse cloth made of wool, produced in Scandinavia, mostly 1000~1500 CE.\n\n[[Sea silk]] is an extremely fine, rare, and valuable fabric that is made from the silky filaments or byssus secreted by a gland in the foot of pen shells.\n\nSilk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of the Chinese [[silkworm]] which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness.  There are two main types of the silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the [[Bombyx mori|Bombyx Mori]], and 'wild silk' such as [[Wild silk|Tussah silk]] (wild silk). Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trevisan |first=Adrian |title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture |url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture |publisher=Sense of Nature |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507085636/http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Plant ===\n[[File:Barong Up Close.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a [[Barong Tagalog]] made with [[pi\u00f1a]] fiber in the [[Philippines]].]]\n[[Poaceae|Grass]], [[Juncaceae|rush]], [[hemp]], and [[sisal]] are all used in making [[rope]]. In the first two, the entire plant is used for this purpose, while in the last two, only fibres from the plant are utilized. [[Coir]] ([[coconut]] fibre) is used in making [[twine]], and also in floormats, [[Mat|doormats]], [[brush]]es, [[mattress]]es, floor tiles, and [[Bag|sacking]].\n\n[[Straw]] and [[bamboo textiles|bamboo]] are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]].\n\nFibres from [[pulpwood]] trees, cotton, [[rice paper|rice]], hemp, and [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] are used in making [[paper]].\n\n[[Cotton]], [[Linen|flax]], jute, hemp, [[Modal (textile)|modal]] and even bamboo fibre are all used in clothing. [[Pi\u00f1a]] ([[pineapple]] fibre) and [[ramie]] are also fibres used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibres such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk fibre has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibres like hemp or flax.\n\nThe inner bark of the [[Lagetta lagetto|lacebark tree]] is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope.\n\n[[cellulose acetate|Acetate]] is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as [[silk]]s, [[velvet]]s, and [[taffeta]]s.\n\n[[Seaweed]] is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fibre known as [[Alginic acid|alginate]] is produced and is used as a holding fibre; when the cloth is finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area.\n\n[[Rayon]] is a manufactured fabric derived from plant pulp. Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.\n\nFibres from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also known as 'bast' fibres.\n\n=== Mineral ===\nAsbestos and [[basalt fibre]] are used for vinyl tiles, sheeting and adhesives, \"transite\" panels and siding, acoustical ceilings, stage curtains, and fire blankets.\n\n[[Glass fibre]] is used in the production of ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fibre for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibres. Glass fibres are woven and coated with [[Teflon]] to produce [[beta cloth]], a virtually fireproof fabric which replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States [[space suit]]s since 1968.{{Verify source|date=January 2018}}\n\nMetal fibre, metal foil, and metal wire have a variety of uses, including the production of [[cloth-of-gold]] and [[jewellery]]. [[Hardware cloth]] (US term only) is a coarse woven [[mesh]] of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard [[window screen]]ing, but heavier and with a more open weave.\n\nMinerals and natural and synthetic fabrics may be combined, as in [[emery cloth]], a layer of [[Emery (rock)|emery]] abrasive glued to a cloth backing.  Also, \"sand cloth\" is a U.S. term for fine wire mesh with abrasive glued to it, employed like emery cloth or coarse [[sandpaper]].\n\n=== Synthetic ===\n[[File:Cloth 800.jpg|thumb|A variety of contemporary fabrics.

Thicker nylon fibres are used in [[rope]] and outdoor clothing.\n\n[[Spandex]] (trade name ''Lycra'') is a [[polyurethane]] product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement.  It is used to make [[activewear]], [[Brassiere|bras]], and [[swimsuit]]s.\n\n[[Olefin fibre]] is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing.  Olefins are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly.  A sintered felt of olefin fibres is sold under the trade name [[Tyvek]].\n\n[[Ingeo]] is a [[polylactide]] fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing.  It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to wick away perspiration.\n\n[[Lurex (yarn)|Lurex]] is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.\n\n[[Milk]] proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or [[casein]] fibre cloth was developed during [[World War I]] in Germany, and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s.<ref>Euroflax Industries Ltd.

This is done on a frame or machine known as a [[loom]], of which there are a number of types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanized.\n\n[[Knitting]], [[Nalebinding|looping]], and [[crochet]]ing involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed either on a [[knitting needle]], needle, or on a [[crochet hook]], together in a line. The processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while Looping and crocheting never have more than one active loop on the needle. Knitting can be performed by machine, but crochet can only be performed by hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looping and Knitting|last=Rowe|first=Ann Pollard|publisher=The Textile Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n[[Spread Tow]] is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes, and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for composite materials; [[spread tow fabric]]s can be made in [[carbon]], [[aramide]], etc.\n\n[[Braid]]ing or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making [[tatting]] and [[macrame]].\n\n[[Lace]] is made by interlocking threads together independently, using a backing and any of the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.\n\n[[Carpet]]s, rugs, velvet, [[velour]], and [[velveteen]] are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a [[nap (textile)|nap]] or [[pile (textile)|pile]].\n\nFelting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together until they become tangled.  A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.\n\n[[Nonwoven]] textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric. Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.\n\n[[Barkcloth|Bark cloth]] is made by pounding bark until it is soft and flat.\n\n== Treatments ==\n[[File:Double ikat weaving from Sulu, Philippines, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|right|A double [[ikat]] weaving made by the [[Tausug people]] from [[Sulu]], made of banana leaf stalk fiber ([[Abac\u00e1]]).]]\nTextiles are often [[dyeing|dyed]], with fabrics available in almost every colour.

[[Woodblock printing]], still used in India and elsewhere today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 CE in [[China]].  Textiles are also sometimes [[bleach]]ed, making the textile pale or white.\n\n[[File:GuatemalaWeavings79.jpg|thumb|Brilliantly dyed traditional woven textiles of [[Guatemala]], and woman weaving on a backstrap [[loom]]]]\nTextiles are sometimes finished by chemical processes to change their characteristics. In the 19th century and early 20th century [[starch]]ing was commonly used to make clothing more resistant to stains and wrinkles.\n\n[[Eisengarn]], meaning \"iron yarn\" in English, is a light-reflecting, strong material invented in [[Germany]] in the 19th century. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and paraffin wax solution.  The threads are then stretched and polished by steel rollers and brushes. The end result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant yarn which is extremely hardwearing.<ref name=history>[http://www.wuppertal.ihk24.de/servicemarken/branchen_neu/industrie/industrie_im_bs/902782/Textilstandort_Wuppertal.html ''Industriegeschichte aus dem Bergischen land''] (in German).

In the household they are used in [[carpet]]ing, upholstered [[furniture|furnishings]], [[window shade]]s, [[towel]]s, coverings for tables, beds, and other flat surfaces, and in [[art]]. In the workplace they are used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses include [[flag]]s, [[backpack]]s, [[tent]]s, [[Net (device)|nets]], [[handkerchief]]s, cleaning [[wikt:rag|rags]], [[transportation]] devices such as [[balloon]]s, [[kite flying|kites]], [[sail]]s, and [[parachute]]s; textiles are also used to provide strengthening in [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] and industrial [[geotextile]]s. Textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as [[sewing]], [[quilting]]  and [[embroidery]].\n\nTextiles for industrial purposes, and chosen for characteristics other than their appearance, are commonly referred to as ''[[technical textiles]].'' Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g. implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for [[crop protection]]), protective clothing (e.g. against heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing, against molten metals for welders, stab protection, and [[bullet]] proof vests).

The first three are natural. In the 20th century, they were supplemented by artificial fibres made from [[petroleum]]. Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest [[microfibre]] made of strands thinner than one [[Units_of_textile_measurement#Denier|denier]] to the sturdiest [[canvas]]. [[Textile manufacturing terminology]] has a wealth of descriptive terms, from light [[gauze]]-like [[Gossamer (fabric)|gossamer]] to heavy [[grosgrain]] cloth and beyond.\n\n=== Animal ===\nAnimal textiles are commonly made from [[hair]], [[fur]], [[skin]] or [[silk]] (in the silkworms case).\n\n[[Wool]] refers to the hair of the domestic [[sheep]] or [[goat]], which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a [[wax]] mixture known as [[lanolin]] (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Woollen]] refers to a bulkier yarn produced from carded, non-parallel fibre, while [[worsted]] refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibers which have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. [[Cashmere wool|Cashmere]], the hair of the Indian [[cashmere goat]], and [[mohair]], the hair of the North African [[angora goat]], are types of wool known for their softness.\n\nOther animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, [[Vicu\u00f1a|vicu\u00f1a wool]], llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[poncho]]s, [[blanket]]s, and other warm coverings. [[Angora wool|Angora]] refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the [[angora rabbit]]. [[Qiviut]] is the fine inner wool of the [[muskox]].\n\n[[Wadmal]] is a coarse cloth made of wool, produced in Scandinavia, mostly 1000~1500 CE.\n\n[[Sea silk]] is an extremely fine, rare, and valuable fabric that is made from the silky filaments or byssus secreted by a gland in the foot of pen shells.\n\nSilk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of the Chinese [[silkworm]] which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness.  There are two main types of the silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the [[Bombyx mori|Bombyx Mori]], and 'wild silk' such as [[Wild silk|Tussah silk]] (wild silk). Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves.

Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]].\n\nFibres from [[pulpwood]] trees, cotton, [[rice paper|rice]], hemp, and [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] are used in making [[paper]].\n\n[[Cotton]], [[Linen|flax]], jute, hemp, [[Modal (textile)|modal]] and even bamboo fibre are all used in clothing. [[Pi\u00f1a]] ([[pineapple]] fibre) and [[ramie]] are also fibres used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibres such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to make a fibre and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk fibre has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibres like hemp or flax.\n\nThe inner bark of the [[Lagetta lagetto|lacebark tree]] is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope.\n\n[[cellulose acetate|Acetate]] is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as [[silk]]s, [[velvet]]s, and [[taffeta]]s.\n\n[[Seaweed]] is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fibre known as [[Alginic acid|alginate]] is produced and is used as a holding fibre; when the cloth is finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area.\n\n[[Rayon]] is a manufactured fabric derived from plant pulp. Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.\n\nFibres from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also known as 'bast' fibres.\n\n=== Mineral ===\nAsbestos and [[basalt fibre]] are used for vinyl tiles, sheeting and adhesives, \"transite\" panels and siding, acoustical ceilings, stage curtains, and fire blankets.\n\n[[Glass fibre]] is used in the production of ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fibre for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibres. Glass fibres are woven and coated with [[Teflon]] to produce [[beta cloth]], a virtually fireproof fabric which replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States [[space suit]]s since 1968.{{Verify source|date=January 2018}}\n\nMetal fibre, metal foil, and metal wire have a variety of uses, including the production of [[cloth-of-gold]] and [[jewellery]]. [[Hardware cloth]] (US term only) is a coarse woven [[mesh]] of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard [[window screen]]ing, but heavier and with a more open weave.\n\nMinerals and natural and synthetic fabrics may be combined, as in [[emery cloth]], a layer of [[Emery (rock)|emery]] abrasive glued to a cloth backing.  Also, \"sand cloth\" is a U.S. term for fine wire mesh with abrasive glued to it, employed like emery cloth or coarse [[sandpaper]].\n\n=== Synthetic ===\n[[File:Cloth 800.jpg|thumb|A variety of contemporary fabrics.

Thicker nylon fibres are used in [[rope]] and outdoor clothing.\n\n[[Spandex]] (trade name ''Lycra'') is a [[polyurethane]] product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement.  It is used to make [[activewear]], [[Brassiere|bras]], and [[swimsuit]]s.\n\n[[Olefin fibre]] is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing.  Olefins are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly.  A sintered felt of olefin fibres is sold under the trade name [[Tyvek]].\n\n[[Ingeo]] is a [[polylactide]] fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing.  It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to wick away perspiration.\n\n[[Lurex (yarn)|Lurex]] is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.\n\n[[Milk]] proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or [[casein]] fibre cloth was developed during [[World War I]] in Germany, and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s.<ref>Euroflax Industries Ltd.

This is done on a frame or machine known as a [[loom]], of which there are a number of types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanized.\n\n[[Knitting]], [[Nalebinding|looping]], and [[crochet]]ing involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed either on a [[knitting needle]], needle, or on a [[crochet hook]], together in a line. The processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while Looping and crocheting never have more than one active loop on the needle. Knitting can be performed by machine, but crochet can only be performed by hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looping and Knitting|last=Rowe|first=Ann Pollard|publisher=The Textile Museum|year=1997|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n[[Spread Tow]] is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes, and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for composite materials; [[spread tow fabric]]s can be made in [[carbon]], [[aramide]], etc.\n\n[[Braid]]ing or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making [[tatting]] and [[macrame]].\n\n[[Lace]] is made by interlocking threads together independently, using a backing and any of the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.\n\n[[Carpet]]s, rugs, velvet, [[velour]], and [[velveteen]] are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a [[nap (textile)|nap]] or [[pile (textile)|pile]].\n\nFelting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together until they become tangled.  A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.\n\n[[Nonwoven]] textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric. Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.\n\n[[Barkcloth|Bark cloth]] is made by pounding bark until it is soft and flat.\n\n== Treatments ==\n[[File:Double ikat weaving from Sulu, Philippines, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|right|A double [[ikat]] weaving made by the [[Tausug people]] from [[Sulu]], made of banana leaf stalk fiber ([[Abac\u00e1]]).]]\nTextiles are often [[dyeing|dyed]], with fabrics available in almost every colour.

[[Woodblock printing]], still used in India and elsewhere today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 CE in [[China]].  Textiles are also sometimes [[bleach]]ed, making the textile pale or white.\n\n[[File:GuatemalaWeavings79.jpg|thumb|Brilliantly dyed traditional woven textiles of [[Guatemala]], and woman weaving on a backstrap [[loom]]]]\nTextiles are sometimes finished by chemical processes to change their characteristics. In the 19th century and early 20th century [[starch]]ing was commonly used to make clothing more resistant to stains and wrinkles.\n\n[[Eisengarn]], meaning \"iron yarn\" in English, is a light-reflecting, strong material invented in [[Germany]] in the 19th century. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and paraffin wax solution.  The threads are then stretched and polished by steel rollers and brushes. The end result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant yarn which is extremely hardwearing.<ref name=history>[http://www.wuppertal.ihk24.de/servicemarken/branchen_neu/industrie/industrie_im_bs/902782/Textilstandort_Wuppertal.html ''Industriegeschichte aus dem Bergischen land''] (in German).

West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas Light Sweet, is a type of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is a light crude oil, lighter than Brent Crude oil. It contains about 0.24% sulfur, rating it a sweet crude, sweeter than Brent. Its properties and production site make it ideal for being refined in the United States, mostly in the Midwest and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] (USGC) regions. WTI has an API gravity of around 39.6 (specific gravity approx. 0.827). [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.\n\nThe [[National Bank of Canada]]'s Tim Simard, argued that WCS is the benchmark for those buying shares in Canadian oil sands companies, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., or Cenovus Energy Inc., Northern Blizzard Resources Inc., Pengrowth Energy Corp., or Twin Butte Energy Ltd or others where a \"big part of their exposure will be to heavy crude\u201d.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nThe price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil (petroleum) per barrel{{sfn|Index Mundi|nd}} suffers a differential{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI){{sfn|Department of Energy|2012}} as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) as published by [[Bloomberg Media]], which itself has a discount versus London-traded Brent oil.{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} This is based on data on prices and differentials from [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ).\n\n\"West Texas Intermediate Crude oil (WTI) is a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] for the North American market, and [[Edmonton Par]] and Western Canadian Select (WCS) are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and WTI are high-quality low sulphur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40\u00b0. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5\u00b0.\"{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}\n\n[[West Texas Intermediate]] WTI is a sweet, [[light crude oil]], with an [[API gravity]] of around 39.6 and [[specific gravity]] of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a [[sweet crude oil]] (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\n\"WCS prices at a discount to WTI because it is a lower quality crude (3.51Wt. percent sulfur and 20.5 API gravity){{sfn|Moore|2011}} and because of a transportation differential. The price of WCS is currently set at the U.S. Gulf Coast. It costs approximately $10/bbl for a barrel of crude to be transported from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, accounting for at least $10/bbl of the WTI-WCS discount. Pipeline constraints can also cause the transportation differential to rise significantly.\n\nBy March 2015, with the price of Ice Brent at US$60.55, and WTI at US$51.48, up US$1.10 from the previous day, WCS also rose US$1.20 to US$37.23 with a WTI-WCS price differential of US$14.25.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015}}{{rp|B10-11}} By 2 June 2015 with Brent at US$64.88/bbl, WTI at US$60.19/bbl and WCS at US$52.39/bbl.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Financial Post]]'', most Canadian investors continued to quote the price of WTI not WCS even though many Canadian oilsands producers sell at WCS prices, because WCS \"has always lacked the transparency and liquidity necessary to make it a household name with investors in the country\".{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} In 2014 Auspice created the Canadian Crude Excess Return Index to gauge WCS futures. Tim Simard, head of commodities at the ''[[National Bank of Canada]]'', claims \"WCS has \"some interesting different fundamental attributes than the conventional WTI barrel.\" WCS has \"better transparency and broader participation\" than Maya.

[[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.\n\nThe [[National Bank of Canada]]'s Tim Simard, argued that WCS is the benchmark for those buying shares in Canadian oil sands companies, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., or Cenovus Energy Inc., Northern Blizzard Resources Inc., Pengrowth Energy Corp., or Twin Butte Energy Ltd or others where a \"big part of their exposure will be to heavy crude\u201d.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nThe price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil (petroleum) per barrel{{sfn|Index Mundi|nd}} suffers a differential{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI){{sfn|Department of Energy|2012}} as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) as published by [[Bloomberg Media]], which itself has a discount versus London-traded Brent oil.{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} This is based on data on prices and differentials from [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ).\n\n\"West Texas Intermediate Crude oil (WTI) is a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] for the North American market, and [[Edmonton Par]] and Western Canadian Select (WCS) are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and WTI are high-quality low sulphur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40\u00b0. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5\u00b0.\"{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}\n\n[[West Texas Intermediate]] WTI is a sweet, [[light crude oil]], with an [[API gravity]] of around 39.6 and [[specific gravity]] of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a [[sweet crude oil]] (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\n\"WCS prices at a discount to WTI because it is a lower quality crude (3.51Wt. percent sulfur and 20.5 API gravity){{sfn|Moore|2011}} and because of a transportation differential. The price of WCS is currently set at the U.S. Gulf Coast. It costs approximately $10/bbl for a barrel of crude to be transported from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, accounting for at least $10/bbl of the WTI-WCS discount. Pipeline constraints can also cause the transportation differential to rise significantly.\n\nBy March 2015, with the price of Ice Brent at US$60.55, and WTI at US$51.48, up US$1.10 from the previous day, WCS also rose US$1.20 to US$37.23 with a WTI-WCS price differential of US$14.25.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015}}{{rp|B10-11}} By 2 June 2015 with Brent at US$64.88/bbl, WTI at US$60.19/bbl and WCS at US$52.39/bbl.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Financial Post]]'', most Canadian investors continued to quote the price of WTI not WCS even though many Canadian oilsands producers sell at WCS prices, because WCS \"has always lacked the transparency and liquidity necessary to make it a household name with investors in the country\".{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} In 2014 Auspice created the Canadian Crude Excess Return Index to gauge WCS futures. Tim Simard, head of commodities at the ''[[National Bank of Canada]]'', claims \"WCS has \"some interesting different fundamental attributes than the conventional WTI barrel.\" WCS has \"better transparency and broader participation\" than Maya. However, he explained that in 2015 \"one of the only ways to take a position in oil is to use an ETF that is tied to WTI.\"{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} Simard claims that when the global price of oil is lower, for example, \"the first barrels to be turned off in a low-price environment are heavy barrels\" making WCS \"closer to the floor\" than WTI.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nIn order to address the transparency and liquidity issues facing WCS, Auspice created the [[Canadian Crude Index]] (CCI), which serves as a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for [[Petroleum production in Canada|oil produced in Canada]].<ref name=\"CCIbenchmark\">{{cite web |url=http://boereport.com/2016/01/04/auspice-capital-advisors-launches-first-live-index-tied-to-canadian-crude-oil/  |date=2016-01-04 |title=Auspice Capital Advisors Launches First Live Index Tied to Canadian Crude Oil}}</ref> The CCI allows investors to track the price, risk and [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the Canadian commodity.<ref name=\"CCIbenchmark\" /> The CCI can be used to identify opportunities to speculate outright on the price of Canadian crude oil or in conjunction with [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) to put on a spread trade which could represent the differential between the two.<ref name=\"factsheet\">{{cite web |url=http://content.auspicecapital.com/AuspiceCCIFactSheet2015.pdf |date=2015 |title=Fact sheet |work=Auspice Capital Advisors |access-date=29 December 2018 |location=Calgary, Alberta}}</ref> The CCI provides a fixed price reference for Canadian Crude Oil by targeting  an exposure that represents a three-month rolling position in crude oil.<ref name=\"threemonthrolling\">{{cite web |url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53a1ca9ce4b030ded763dbc2/t/55260223e4b0805894981ebb/1428554275298/Canadian+Crude+Excess+Return+Index+Methodology+3.0.1.pdf |title=Canadian Crude Excess Return Index (CCIER) Methodology |date=April 2015 |pages=7 |work=Auspice Capital Advisors |access-date=29 December 2018 |location=Calgary, Alberta }}</ref> To create a price representative of Canadian crude the index uses two futures contracts: A fixed price contract, which represents the price of crude oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], and a basis differential contract, which represents the difference in price between Cushing and [[Hardisty]], Alberta.<ref name=\"threemonthrolling\" /> Both contracts are priced in U.S. dollars per barrel.

In his presentation to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2013 John Foran demonstrated that Maya had traded at only a slight premium to WCS in 2010. Since then WCS price differentials widened \"with rising oil sands and tight oil production and insufficient pipeline capacity to access global markets\".{{Sfn|Foran|2013}} Mexico enjoys a location discount with its proximity to the heavy oil-capable refineries in the Gulf Coast. As well, Mexico began to strategically and successfully seek out joint venture refinery partnerships in the 1990s to create a market for its heavy crude oil in the U.S. Gulf. In 1993, ([[Pemex|Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos]], the state-owned Mexican oil company) and Shell Oil Company agreed on a joint US$1 billion refinery upgrading construction project which led to the construction of a new coker, hydrotreating unit, sulfur recovery unit and other facilities in Deer Park, Texas on the Houston Ship Channel in order to process large volumes of PEMEX heavy Maya crude while fulfilling the U.S. Clean Air Act requirements.{{sfn|PR|1993}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Year || <!-- 2007 --> 2007 || <!-- 2008 --> 2008 || <!-- 2009 --> 2009 || <!-- 2010 --> 2010 || <!-- 2011 --> 2011 || <!-- 2012 --> 2012 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 2013-02 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 2013-04-24 || <!-- August 2013 --> 2013-08 || <!-- December 2013 --> 2013-12 || <!-- January 2014 -->2014-01 || <!-- April 2014 -->2014-04||<!-- December 2014 -->2014-12 ||<!-- June 2015-06 -->2015-06\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->Brent US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 --> 73 || <!-- 2008 --> 98 || <!-- 2009 --> 62 || <!-- 2010 -->  80 || <!-- 2011 --> 112 || <!-- 2012 --> 112 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 118 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 103.41 || <!-- August 2013 --> 110 || <!-- December 2013 --> || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$64.88/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->WTI US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 --> 72 || <!-- 2008 --> 100 <small>peak:147</small>{{sfn|Scotiabank|2014}} || <!-- 2009 --> 62 || <!-- 2010 -->  80 || <!-- 2011 --> 95 || <!-- 2012 --> 95 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 95 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 93.29{{sfn|PSAC|2013a}} || <!-- August 2013 --> 97.90 || <!-- December 2013 --> || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 --> 102.07 {{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}||US$54.13/bbl){{Sfn|Financial Post|2014a}}{{rp|B7}}<!--US$68.93{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014}}-->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$60.19/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->WCS US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 -->  || <!-- 2008 --> 80 || <!-- 2009 --> 52 || <!-- 2010 -->  65 || <!-- 2011 --> 78 || <!-- 2012 --> 72 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 69 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 77.62{{sfn|PSAC|2013a}} || <!-- August 2013 --> 82.36 || <!-- December 2013 -->67{{Sfn|Philips|2013}} || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 --> $79.56 {{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}||US$38.13/bbl{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014a}}<!--US$51.93{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014}}-->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$52.39/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| Syncrude Sweet || 62 || 102 || 62 || 78 || 104 || 93 || 97 || 98.51 || <!-- December 2013--> || <!-- January 2014--> ||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|-\n| Edmonton Par || 72 || 96 || 58 || 75 || 96 || 86 || 87 || 89.53 || <!-- December 2013--> || <!-- January 2014-->||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|-\n| Maya US$/bbl || <!-- 2007--> || <!-- 2008--> || <!-- 2009--> || <!-- 2010--> || <!-- 2011--> || <!-- 2012--> || 101 || <!-- April 2013--> || <!-- December 2013 --> 2013-12 || 87 {{Sfn|Philips|2013}} || <!-- January 2014--> ||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|}\n\n(Prices except Maya for years 2007-February 2013){{sfn|TD|2013}}(Prices for Maya){{sfn|Van Loon|2013}} (Prices for 24 April 2013).{{sfn|PSCA|2013}}\n\nBy July 2013, Western Canadian Select (WCS) \"heavy oil prices climbed from US$75 to more than US$90 per barrel \u2014 the highest level since mid-2008, when WTI oil prices were at a record (US$147.90) \u2014 just prior to the 2008-09 'Great Recession'.\"{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} WCS \"heavy oil prices were \"expected to remain at the US$90, which is closer to the world price for heavy crude and WCS 'true, inherent value'\".{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} The higher price of WCS oil off WTI was explained by \"new rail shipments alleviating some export pipeline constraints \u2014 and the return of WTI oil prices to international levels\".{{sfn|Mohr|2013}}\n\nBy January 2014 there was a proliferation of trains and pipelines carrying WCS along with an increased demand on the part of U.S. refineries.

The expansion continued in the 1850s and 1860s, to Chicago, New Orleans, Memphis, and San Jose.

These programs, which are offered by public and private not-for-profit institutions, postsecondary vocational institutions, and by for-profit proprietary institutions, should prepare students for [[gainful employment]]. For decades, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) had not established regulations that explicitly outlined what it means for a program to be properly preparing students for gainful employment. As pressing concerns about the quality of programs at for- profit institutions began to arise, the concerns about the level of student loan debt assumed by students did as well. Such issues led to new initiatives and rules to be set in place outlining the parameters for what should be mandated to help ensure gainful employment. The 2011 Senate HELP committee released data showing one in every four students who enroll at a for-profit school default on their loans within three years of leaving, with for-profit students accounting for almost half of all loan defaults.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\">Sessions, Jennifer. (February 8, 2011). \"Harkin Calls on For-Profit Colleges to End Deceptive Recruiting Practices\". Senate HELP Committee. Accessed February 4, 2013.</ref> Most for-profit colleges charge enrollees much higher tuition rates than analogous programs at community colleges and state public universities despite credits being likely not eligible to be transferred to other institutions.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\"/> In fact, 96% of students attending for-profit college apply for federal student loans compared to 13% at community colleges. During the 2009\u20132010 school years, for-profit colleges received almost $32 billion in grants and loans provided to students under federal student aid programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gao.gov/products/GAO-12-150 |title=U.S. GAO - For-Profit Schools: Experiences of Undercover Students Enrolled in Online Classes at Selected Colleges |publisher=Gao.gov |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> This staggering number means nearly all students at for-profit institutions acquire student loan debt, even when they do not earn the end product of a degree or accumulate increased earning power through their studies (Sessions, 2011). These statistics represent a large portion of for- profits, uncovering the serious need for greater accountability in ensuring students are making sound investments in such institutions. According to the [[Government Accountability Office]], enrollment in such institutions has increased faster than traditional higher-education institutions in recent years. With the student and federal interest in such programs growing, so has the concern with their productivity. Regrettably, this is not a simple matter to address, as the issue is multidimensional. For-profit institutions have become an increasingly visible portion of the U.S. higher education sector. For-profits also acquire the largest percentage of their overall revenue from federal student aid programs, highlighting tax dollars are potentially not being used efficiently.<ref>Deming, David. (February 2012). \"The For-Profit Postsecondary School Sector:\nNimble Critters or Agile Predators?\" Center for Analysis Postsecondary education and employment.</ref> Federal regulatory actions by the ED have attempted to address these issues in the Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. These efforts were very contentious. For-profit institutions argue their sector is unfairly targeted and believe the Department of Education over stepped its boundaries in 2010 by implementing regulations specifying requirements for [[Gainful Employment]]. These rules outlined in a report by Congressional Research Service (CRS), aimed to hold for-profits accountable by creating standards which must be upheld and followed, which will in turn attempt create more opportunity for gainful employment amongst enrollees.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\">Smole, David.

Programs that offer a rewarding education at a reasonable price will succeed, and institutions will continue to innovate to assist students and taxpayers.<ref>Federal Registrar. 76 FR 34385. \"Program Integrity: Gainful Employment-Debt Measures\". Accessed February 2, 2013.</ref> The regulations mandated by the ED were to help regulate the for-profit sector and to combat the issue of gainful employment. However, the [[Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities]], which endorses for-profits, challenged these regulations in court. On June 30, 2012 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decided to vacate most aspects of the regulations.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\" /> The court sustained that the ED had the authority to regulate gainful employment, yet it cited the ED had not provided rationale metrics or measures in the debt measures. At present, only the disclosure requirements of providing prospective students with placements rates, on time graduation rates and other similar information remain.<ref>Smole, David. (January 23, 2013). \"Department of Education Final Rules for Postsecondary Education Programs That Prepare Students for Gainful Employment in a Recognized Occupation\". Accessed February 4, 2013. Congressional Research Service Database</ref> On March 19, 2013 the judge ruled again in response to the ED's motion to reinstate the reporting requirements in order that it could implement the disclosure requirements of Gainful Employment. The judged denied the motion of the ED on the basis that the reporting requirements would violate the federal ban on the student unit record system. It is strongly debatable that the court's ruling negates the small amount of transparency and accountability mandated by the disclosure requirements, leaving the policy issue of for-profits being accountable for [[Gainful Employment]] unattended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newamerica.net/taxonomy/term/1764 |title=Welcome to nginx! |publisher=Newamerica.net |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> Some former students claim that for-profit colleges make them feel like they went to the flea market and bought themselves a degree.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6838088n CBS News Video, \"For-Profit Colleges Under Fire\"], September 18, 2010.</ref> According to James G.

These programs, which are offered by public and private not-for-profit institutions, postsecondary vocational institutions, and by for-profit proprietary institutions, should prepare students for [[gainful employment]]. For decades, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) had not established regulations that explicitly outlined what it means for a program to be properly preparing students for gainful employment. As pressing concerns about the quality of programs at for- profit institutions began to arise, the concerns about the level of student loan debt assumed by students did as well. Such issues led to new initiatives and rules to be set in place outlining the parameters for what should be mandated to help ensure gainful employment. The 2011 Senate HELP committee released data showing one in every four students who enroll at a for-profit school default on their loans within three years of leaving, with for-profit students accounting for almost half of all loan defaults.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\">Sessions, Jennifer. (February 8, 2011). \"Harkin Calls on For-Profit Colleges to End Deceptive Recruiting Practices\". Senate HELP Committee. Accessed February 4, 2013.</ref> Most for-profit colleges charge enrollees much higher tuition rates than analogous programs at community colleges and state public universities despite credits being likely not eligible to be transferred to other institutions.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\"/> In fact, 96% of students attending for-profit college apply for federal student loans compared to 13% at community colleges. During the 2009\u20132010 school years, for-profit colleges received almost $32 billion in grants and loans provided to students under federal student aid programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gao.gov/products/GAO-12-150 |title=U.S. GAO - For-Profit Schools: Experiences of Undercover Students Enrolled in Online Classes at Selected Colleges |publisher=Gao.gov |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> This staggering number means nearly all students at for-profit institutions acquire student loan debt, even when they do not earn the end product of a degree or accumulate increased earning power through their studies (Sessions, 2011). These statistics represent a large portion of for- profits, uncovering the serious need for greater accountability in ensuring students are making sound investments in such institutions. According to the [[Government Accountability Office]], enrollment in such institutions has increased faster than traditional higher-education institutions in recent years. With the student and federal interest in such programs growing, so has the concern with their productivity. Regrettably, this is not a simple matter to address, as the issue is multidimensional. For-profit institutions have become an increasingly visible portion of the U.S. higher education sector. For-profits also acquire the largest percentage of their overall revenue from federal student aid programs, highlighting tax dollars are potentially not being used efficiently.<ref>Deming, David. (February 2012). \"The For-Profit Postsecondary School Sector:\nNimble Critters or Agile Predators?\" Center for Analysis Postsecondary education and employment.</ref> Federal regulatory actions by the ED have attempted to address these issues in the Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. These efforts were very contentious. For-profit institutions argue their sector is unfairly targeted and believe the Department of Education over stepped its boundaries in 2010 by implementing regulations specifying requirements for [[Gainful Employment]]. These rules outlined in a report by Congressional Research Service (CRS), aimed to hold for-profits accountable by creating standards which must be upheld and followed, which will in turn attempt create more opportunity for gainful employment amongst enrollees.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\">Smole, David. (January 23, 2013). \"Department of Education Final Rules for Postsecondary Education Programs That Prepare Students for Gainful Employment in a Recognized Occupation\". Accessed February 4, 2013.

Accessed February 2, 2013.</ref>The regulations mandated by the ED were to help regulate the for-profit sector and to combat the issue of gainful employment. However, the [[Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities]], which endorses for-profits, challenged these regulations in court. On June 30, 2012 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decided to vacate most aspects of the regulations.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\" /> The court sustained that the ED had the authority to regulate gainful employment, yet it cited the ED had not provided rationale metrics or measures in the debt measures. At present, only the disclosure requirements of providing prospective students with placements rates, on time graduation rates and other similar information remain.<ref>Smole, David. (January 23, 2013). \"Department of Education Final Rules for Postsecondary Education Programs That Prepare Students for Gainful Employment in a Recognized Occupation\". Accessed February 4, 2013. Congressional Research Service Database</ref> On March 19, 2013 the judge ruled again in response to the ED's motion to reinstate the reporting requirements in order that it could implement the disclosure requirements of Gainful Employment.
