After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

In a career spanning from 1995 to 2016, in which he made over 700 appearances, he played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Carterton F.C.|Carterton Town]], [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]], [[Cirencester Town F.C.|Cirencester Town]] (on loan) and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. At international level Duff won 24 caps for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. Since 2018, he is the manager of {{English football updater|CheltenT}} club [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]], having previously managed the [[Burnley F.C. Under-23s and Academy|Burnley reserves]] for two years.\n\nWith Burnley, Duff became the first footballer to be promoted to the [[Premier League]] on three occasions with the same club. He is also the only player in history to have played in each of the top eight tiers of [[English football league system|English football]].\n\n==Playing career==\nAlthough born in [[Belfast]],<ref name=Hugman/> Duff was raised in [[Bedale]], North Yorkshire. As a school boy he represented [[North Yorkshire]] and joined the [[Darlington Football Club]] School of Excellence before moving to [[Cheltenham]] in 1994.\n\nSpotted by [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] scout Derek Bragg playing for [[Carterton F.C.|Carterton Town]], Duff was invited by Mike Davis, youth team manager to join Cheltenham, then playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. He had a spell on loan at [[Cirencester Town F.C.|Cirencester Town]] before returning to Cheltenham when [[Steve Cotterill]] took over as manager.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Michael-Duff-fairytale-story/story-11877029-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505121113/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Michael-Duff-fairytale-story/story-11877029-detail/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=The Michael Duff fairytale story |publisher=This is Gloucestershire |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2012 }}</ref> He became a regular for Cheltenham, and went on to play 242 games and score 15 times, including a 93rd-minute winner in a 3\u20132 victory at home to [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] in 1999 that secured Cheltenham Town promotion to the Football League.\n\nOn 5 July 2004, he made a \u00a330,000<ref>[http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10413~10154,00.html Michael Duff | Burnley | Team | Profiles<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516093327/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10413~10154,00.html |date=16 May 2008 }}</ref> switch to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] where he became a regular, if not always automatic, first-team choice. Over the next couple of seasons he established himself as first choice right-back, although he had equally often played at centre-back. His first Burnley goal was credited in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] game against [[Carlisle United]], even though it might equally have been credited as an [[own goal]]. He finally got incontrovertibly on the score-sheet on 14 October 2006 against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].\n\nDuff was part of two of [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]'s finest international moments of recent years; as a late substitute in their 1\u20130 victory over [[England national football team|England]] on 7 September 2005 and then in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Spain national football team|Spain]] on 6 September 2006.\n\nIn the [[2007-08 in English football|2007\u201308]] season Duff picked up a serious injury during the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] match against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Turf Moor]]. The injury ruled Duff out for almost a year, causing him to miss the first half of Burnley's [[Premier League]] campaign. He suffered multiple ligament damage and hamstring damage as well as a [[cruciate ligament|cruciate]] knee injury.<ref>[http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~1125738,00.html Duff Faces Lengthy Spell Out | Burnley | News | Latest Headlines | Latest Headlines<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110125503/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~1125738,00.html |date=10 January 2008 }}</ref> Duff started his first Premier League match on Boxing Day 2009 against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at Turf Moor, having made his debut as a substitute in the preceding game versus [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

By the summer of 2013, having earned a season extension for [[2013\u201314 in English football|2013\u201314]] on the basis of his appearances, Duff was the longest-serving player at the club. On 2 July 2014, Duff signed a new one-year contract with Burnley, Duff remained the only survivor of the squad that reached the Premier League in 2009 and his final deal meant the former Northern Ireland international entered his 11th season with the club.\n\nDuff retired from playing professionally at the end of [[2015\u201316 in English football|2015\u201316]] season, having helped Burnley

In a career spanning from 1995 to 2016, in which he made over 700 appearances, he played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Carterton F.C.|Carterton Town]], [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]], [[Cirencester Town F.C.|Cirencester Town]] (on loan) and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. At international level Duff won 24 caps for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. Since 2018, he is the manager of {{English football updater|CheltenT}} club [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]], having previously managed the [[Burnley F.C. Under-23s and Academy|Burnley reserves]] for two years.\n\nWith Burnley, Duff became the first footballer to be promoted to the [[Premier League]] on three occasions with the same club. He is also the only player in history to have played in each of the top eight tiers of [[English football league system|English football]].\n\n==Playing career==\nAlthough born in [[Belfast]],<ref name=Hugman/> Duff was raised in [[Bedale]], North Yorkshire. As a school boy he represented [[North Yorkshire]] and joined the [[Darlington Football Club]] School of Excellence before moving to [[Cheltenham]] in 1994.\n\nSpotted by [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] scout Derek Bragg playing for [[Carterton F.C.|Carterton Town]], Duff was invited by Mike Davis, youth team manager to join Cheltenham, then playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. He had a spell on loan at [[Cirencester Town F.C.|Cirencester Town]] before returning to Cheltenham when [[Steve Cotterill]] took over as manager.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Michael-Duff-fairytale-story/story-11877029-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505121113/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Michael-Duff-fairytale-story/story-11877029-detail/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=The Michael Duff fairytale story |publisher=This is Gloucestershire |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2012 }}</ref> He became a regular for Cheltenham, and went on to play 242 games and score 15 times, including a 93rd-minute winner in a 3\u20132 victory at home to [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] in 1999 that secured Cheltenham Town promotion to the Football League.\n\nOn 5 July 2004, he made a \u00a330,000<ref>[http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10413~10154,00.html Michael Duff | Burnley | Team | Profiles<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516093327/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10413~10154,00.html |date=16 May 2008 }}</ref> switch to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] where he became a regular, if not always automatic, first-team choice. Over the next couple of seasons he established himself as first choice right-back, although he had equally often played at centre-back. His first Burnley goal was credited in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] game against [[Carlisle United]], even though it might equally have been credited as an [[own goal]]. He finally got incontrovertibly on the score-sheet on 14 October 2006 against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].\n\nDuff was part of two of [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]'s finest international moments of recent years; as a late substitute in their 1\u20130 victory over [[England national football team|England]] on 7 September 2005 and then in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Spain national football team|Spain]] on 6 September 2006.\n\nIn the [[2007-08 in English football|2007\u201308]] season Duff picked up a serious injury during the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] match against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Turf Moor]]. The injury ruled Duff out for almost a year, causing him to miss the first half of Burnley's [[Premier League]] campaign. He suffered multiple ligament damage and hamstring damage as well as a [[cruciate ligament|cruciate]] knee injury.<ref>[http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~1125738,00.html Duff Faces Lengthy Spell Out | Burnley | News | Latest Headlines | Latest Headlines<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110125503/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~1125738,00.html |date=10 January 2008 }}</ref> Duff started his first Premier League match on Boxing Day 2009 against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at Turf Moor, having made his debut as a substitute in the preceding game versus [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

By the summer of 2013, having earned a season extension for [[2013\u201314 in English football|2013\u201314]] on the basis of his appearances, Duff was the longest-serving player at the club. On 2 July 2014, Duff signed a new one-year contract with Burnley, Duff remained the only survivor of the squad that reached the Premier League in 2009 and his final deal meant the former Northern Ireland international entered his 11th season with the club.\n\nDuff retired from playing professionally at the end of [[2015\u201316 in English football|2015\u201316]] season, having helped Burnley

Bredenhof, Failure and Prospect: Lazarus and the Rich Man (Luke 16:19\u201331) in the Context of Luke-Acts (LNTS 603; London: Bloomsbury T&T Clark, 2019), pp 5-10. </ref>. \n\nThe story is unique to Luke and is not thought to come from the hypothetical [[Q document]].<ref name=\"Hultgren\"/>\n\n===As a literal historical event===\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nSome Christians view the story not as a parable, but as an actual event which was related by Jesus to his followers.<ref name=\"Webpage\">e.g. [http://www.bible.ca/su-hades-luke16.htm#mainline Webpage]{{full citation needed|{{subst:DATE}}|date=February 2020}} which argues that Lazarus and the rich man is literally true (whilst the language used by them could have been figurative).</ref> This was generally the view of the medieval Church.\n\nSupporters of this view point to a key detail in the story: the use of a personal name (Lazarus) not found in any other parable. By contrast, in all of the other parables Jesus refers to a central character by a description, such as \"a certain man\", \"a sower\", and so forth.<ref> For a review of ancient and contemporary interpretations of the name 'Lazarus', see  R.M. Bredenhof, \"Looking for Lazarus: Assigning Meaning to the Poor Man in Luke 16.19\u201331\", New Testament Studies 66 (2020), pp 51-67. </ref>. \n\nCritics of this view point out that \"The soul that sins, it shall die\" (Ezekiel 18); \"For dust you are and to dust you shall return\" (Genesis 3:19). [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] (1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201318) describes death as sleep until the Day of the Lord, when the dead will receive glorified bodies upon the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). No scripture, other than Philippians 1:23\u201325 (in which the apostle expresses the confidence that on departure from this life he would be with Christ), 2 Corinthians 12:2\u20134 (in which he affirms the possibility of being taken to paradise out of the body), 2 Corinthians 5:8, etc., accounts for a disembodied soul and its comfort or torture. Because this seems to raise the question of what kind of body is tortured in Hades as depicted in Luke, there are those who maintain that whilst the conversations took place as described, the language used in them, referring to body parts, etc., was figurative.<ref name=\"Webpage\" />\n\n===As a parable created by Jesus===\nOther Christians consider that this is a parable created by Jesus and told to his followers.<ref>e.g. ''The IVP Bible Background Commentary''</ref> [[N. T. Wright|Tom Wright]]<ref>Wright T. ''Luke for Everyone'' \"doesn't add anything new to the general folk belief about fortunes being reversed in a future life. If it's a parable, that means once again that we should take it as picture language about something that was going on in Jesus' work\" p. 201</ref> and [[Joachim Jeremias]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gD4laLYTTDkC |pages=123\u2013125 |title=Die Gleichnisse Jesu |isbn=978-3-525-53514-1 |last1=Jeremias |first1=Joachim |date=January 1998}}</ref> both treat it as a \"parable\". Proponents of this view argue that the story of Lazarus and the rich man has much in common with other stories which are agreed-upon parables, both in language and content (e.g. the reversal of fortunes, the use of antithesis, and concern for the poor).\n\n====Jesus using parable against the High Priest====\nAccording to [[Josephus]], [[Caiaphas]] was appointed [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] in AD 18 by the Roman [[Judea (Roman province)|prefect]] who preceded [[Pontius Pilate]], [[Valerius Gratus]].<ref name=\"oxford\">Metzger & Coogan  ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', 1993. p 97</ref>\n\nOne identification is that the man in torment in the parable is Caiaphas the High Priest. Caiaphas met the criteria Jesus gives in the parable to the identity of the Rich Man. He was rich, and as the high priest was dressed in purple and fine linen, he had five brothers, and was well versed in Moses and the Prophets, but according to Jesus, were ignoring what they wrote.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_lazarus.htm |title = The Rich Man,Lazarus, and Abraham}}</ref>\n\n====Luther: a parable of the conscience====\n[[Martin Luther]] taught that the story was a parable about rich and poor in this life and the details of the afterlife not to be taken literally:\n\n{{quote|Therefore we conclude that the bosom of Abraham signifies nothing else than the Word of God,&nbsp;... the hell here mentioned cannot be the true hell that will begin on the day of judgment. For the corpse of the rich man is without doubt not in hell, but buried in the earth; it must however be a place where the soul can be and has no peace, and it cannot be corporeal. Therefore it seems to me, this hell is the conscience, which is without faith and without the Word of God, in which the soul is buried and held until the day of judgment, when they are cast down body and soul into the true and real hell.

From whence it is easy to judge what was the design and intention of this parable. (From the Talmud and Hebraica, Volume 3)<ref>2007 edition p. 176</ref>}}\n\n[[E. W. Bullinger]] in the Companion Bible cited Lightfoot's comment,<ref>Companion Bible p. 1489, citing \"Lightfoot xii, 159\u201363\"</ref> and expanded it to include coincidence to lack of belief in the resurrection of the historical Lazarus (John 12:10). Bullinger considered that Luke did not identify the passage as a \"parable\" because it contains a parody of the view of the afterlife:\n\n{{quote|It is not called a parable because it cites a notable example of the Pharisee's tradition which had been brought from Babylon.<ref>See many other examples in Lightfoot vol. xii. pp. 159\u201368 (Companion Bible, p. 1488)</ref>}}\n\n====Drioux: a parable against the Sadducees====\nAn alternative explanation of the parable is a [[Satire|satirical]] parable against the [[Sadducees]]. One writer to identify the [[Sadducees]] as the target was [[Johann Nepomuk Sepp]].<ref>Sepp ''Thaten und Lehren Jesu: mit ihrer weltgeschichtlichen Beglaubigung'' 1864</ref> The arguments in favour of identification of the Rich Man as the Sadducees are (1) the wearing of purple and fine linen, priestly dress,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphianbooks.org/haw/sitg/sitgb43.html|last=Whittaker |first=H.

[[Patrick Fairbairn]]) ''The parables of Jesus: explained and illustrated'' 1853 p. 343 \"Many expositors have thought they discovered, in this story, a real history, and referred it to the family of Annas and his son-in-law, Caiaphas,\"</ref> (3) Abraham's statement in the parable that they would not believe even if he raised Lazarus, and then the fulfillment that when Jesus did raise Lazarus of Bethany the Sadducees not only did not believe, but attempted to have Lazarus killed again: \"So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well\" (John 12:10). This last interpretation had wide circulation in France during the 1860s\u20131890s as a result of having been included in the notes of the pictorial Bible of [[Claude-Joseph Drioux|Abb\u00e9 Drioux]].<ref>\"et c'est cet endurcissement que J\u00e9sus pr\u00e9dit quand il dit que du moment qu'ils n'\u00e9coutent ni Mo\u00efse ni les proph\u00e8tes ils n'\u00e9couteront pas d'avantage quelqu'un qui viendrait de l'autre monde\".

Hachette, Paris 1864 p. 497</ref>\n\n====Perry: a parable of a new covenant====\nSimon Perry has argued that the Lazarus of the parable (an abbreviated transcript of \"Eleazer\") refers to [[Eliezer]] of Damascus, Abraham's servant. In Genesis 15\u2014a foundational covenant text familiar to any first century Jew\u2014God says to Abraham \"this man will not be your heir\" (Gen 15:4). Perry argues that this is why Lazarus is outside the gates of Abraham's perceived descendant. By inviting Lazarus to Abraham's bosom, Jesus is redefining the nature of the covenant. It also explains why the rich man assumes Lazarus is Abraham's servant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=Resurrecting Interpretation: Technology, Hermeneutics and the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus|year=2012|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, OR|url=http://simonperry.org.uk/publications|accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\n==Afterlife doctrine==\n{{main|Afterlife}}\nMost Christians believe in the [[immortality of the soul]] and [[particular judgment]] and see the story as consistent with it, or even refer to it to establish these doctrines like [[Irenaeus of Lyons|St. Irenaeus]] did.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_I/IRENAEUS/Against_Heresies:_Book_II/Chapter_XXXIV.|title=Irenaeus.

Bredenhof, Failure and Prospect: Lazarus and the Rich Man (Luke 16:19\u201331) in the Context of Luke-Acts (LNTS 603; London: Bloomsbury T&T Clark, 2019), pp 5-10 </ref>. \n\nThe story is unique to Luke and is not thought to come from the hypothetical [[Q document]].<ref name=\"Hultgren\"/>\n\n===As a literal historical event===\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nSome Christians view the story not as a parable, but as an actual event which was related by Jesus to his followers.<ref name=\"Webpage\">e.g. [http://www.bible.ca/su-hades-luke16.htm#mainline Webpage]{{full citation needed|{{subst:DATE}}|date=February 2020}} which argues that Lazarus and the rich man is literally true (whilst the language used by them could have been figurative).</ref> This was generally the view of the medieval Church.\n\nSupporters of this view point to a key detail in the story: the use of a personal name (Lazarus) not found in any other parable. By contrast, in all of the other parables Jesus refers to a central character by a description, such as \"a certain man\", \"a sower\", and so forth.<ref> For a review of ancient and contemporary interpretations of the name 'Lazarus', see  R.M. Bredenhof, \"Looking for Lazarus: Assigning Meaning to the Poor Man in Luke 16.19\u201331\", New Testament Studies 66 (2020), pp 51-67. </ref>. \n\nCritics of this view point out that \"The soul that sins, it shall die\" (Ezekiel 18); \"For dust you are and to dust you shall return\" (Genesis 3:19). [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] (1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201318) describes death as sleep until the Day of the Lord, when the dead will receive glorified bodies upon the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). No scripture, other than Philippians 1:23\u201325 (in which the apostle expresses the confidence that on departure from this life he would be with Christ), 2 Corinthians 12:2\u20134 (in which he affirms the possibility of being taken to paradise out of the body), 2 Corinthians 5:8, etc., accounts for a disembodied soul and its comfort or torture. Because this seems to raise the question of what kind of body is tortured in Hades as depicted in Luke, there are those who maintain that whilst the conversations took place as described, the language used in them, referring to body parts, etc., was figurative.<ref name=\"Webpage\" />\n\n===As a parable created by Jesus===\nOther Christians consider that this is a parable created by Jesus and told to his followers.<ref>e.g. ''The IVP Bible Background Commentary''</ref> [[N. T. Wright|Tom Wright]]<ref>Wright T. ''Luke for Everyone'' \"doesn't add anything new to the general folk belief about fortunes being reversed in a future life. If it's a parable, that means once again that we should take it as picture language about something that was going on in Jesus' work\" p. 201</ref> and [[Joachim Jeremias]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gD4laLYTTDkC |pages=123\u2013125 |title=Die Gleichnisse Jesu |isbn=978-3-525-53514-1 |last1=Jeremias |first1=Joachim |date=January 1998}}</ref> both treat it as a \"parable\". Proponents of this view argue that the story of Lazarus and the rich man has much in common with other stories which are agreed-upon parables, both in language and content (e.g. the reversal of fortunes, the use of antithesis, and concern for the poor).\n\n====Jesus using parable against the High Priest====\nAccording to [[Josephus]], [[Caiaphas]] was appointed [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] in AD 18 by the Roman [[Judea (Roman province)|prefect]] who preceded [[Pontius Pilate]], [[Valerius Gratus]].<ref name=\"oxford\">Metzger & Coogan  ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', 1993. p 97</ref>\n\nOne identification is that the man in torment in the parable is Caiaphas the High Priest. Caiaphas met the criteria Jesus gives in the parable to the identity of the Rich Man. He was rich, and as the high priest was dressed in purple and fine linen, he had five brothers, and was well versed in Moses and the Prophets, but according to Jesus, were ignoring what they wrote.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_lazarus.htm |title = The Rich Man,Lazarus, and Abraham}}</ref>\n\n====Luther: a parable of the conscience====\n[[Martin Luther]] taught that the story was a parable about rich and poor in this life and the details of the afterlife not to be taken literally:\n\n{{quote|Therefore we conclude that the bosom of Abraham signifies nothing else than the Word of God,&nbsp;... the hell here mentioned cannot be the true hell that will begin on the day of judgment. For the corpse of the rich man is without doubt not in hell, but buried in the earth; it must however be a place where the soul can be and has no peace, and it cannot be corporeal. Therefore it seems to me, this hell is the conscience, which is without faith and without the Word of God, in which the soul is buried and held until the day of judgment, when they are cast down body and soul into the true and real hell.

Bullinger]] in the Companion Bible cited Lightfoot's comment,<ref>Companion Bible p. 1489, citing \"Lightfoot xii, 159\u201363\"</ref> and expanded it to include coincidence to lack of belief in the resurrection of the historical Lazarus (John 12:10). Bullinger considered that Luke did not identify the passage as a \"parable\" because it contains a parody of the view of the afterlife:\n\n{{quote|It is not called a parable because it cites a notable example of the Pharisee's tradition which had been brought from Babylon.<ref>See many other examples in Lightfoot vol. xii. pp. 159\u201368 (Companion Bible, p. 1488)</ref>}}\n\n====Drioux: a parable against the Sadducees====\nAn alternative explanation of the parable is a [[Satire|satirical]] parable against the [[Sadducees]].

This last interpretation had wide circulation in France during the 1860s\u20131890s as a result of having been included in the notes of the pictorial Bible of [[Claude-Joseph Drioux|Abb\u00e9 Drioux]].<ref>\"et c'est cet endurcissement que J\u00e9sus pr\u00e9dit quand il dit que du moment qu'ils n'\u00e9coutent ni Mo\u00efse ni les proph\u00e8tes ils n'\u00e9couteront pas d'avantage quelqu'un qui viendrait de l'autre monde\".

In Genesis 15\u2014a foundational covenant text familiar to any first century Jew\u2014God says to Abraham \"this man will not be your heir\" (Gen 15:4). Perry argues that this is why Lazarus is outside the gates of Abraham's perceived descendant. By inviting Lazarus to Abraham's bosom, Jesus is redefining the nature of the covenant. It also explains why the rich man assumes Lazarus is Abraham's servant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=Resurrecting Interpretation: Technology, Hermeneutics and the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus|year=2012|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, OR|url=http://simonperry.org.uk/publications|accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\n==Afterlife doctrine==\n{{main|Afterlife}}\nMost Christians believe in the [[immortality of the soul]] and [[particular judgment]] and see the story as consistent with it, or even refer to it to establish these doctrines like [[Irenaeus of Lyons|St. Irenaeus]] did.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_I/IRENAEUS/Against_Heresies:_Book_II/Chapter_XXXIV.|title=Irenaeus.

It is unknown when the order became militarised but militarisation occurred before the end of the 12th century due to the large numbers of [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]] sent to the leper hospitals to be treated. The order established \u2018lazar houses\u2019 across Europe to care for lepers, and was well supported by other [[Military order (society)|military orders]] which compelled lazar brethren in their rule to join the order upon contracting leprosy.<ref>David Marcombe, ''Leper Knights'', The Boydell Press 2003, p. 11</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lazaretto]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[Luke 16]]\n* [[Ministry of Jesus]]\n* [[The Sheep and the Goats]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lazarus and Dives}}\n* Biblical Art\n** [http://www.biblical-art.com/biblicalsubject.asp?id_biblicalsubject=786&pagenum=1 Purple and Poverty]\n** [http://www.biblical-art.com/biblicalsubject.asp?id_biblicalsubject=787&pagenum=1 In Hades]\n\n{{Jesus footer}}\n{{Parables of Jesus|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rich Man And Lazarus}}\n[[Category:Abraham]]\n[[Category:Angelic apparitions in the Bible]]\n[[Category:Eschatology in the Bible]]\n[[Category:Gospel of Luke]]\n[[Category:Parables of Jesus]]\n[[Category:Caiaphas]]\n", "name_user": "ReubenBredenhof", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInterpretations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_man_and_Lazarus"}

Despite the praise, Lang awarded the game with two stars stating that he encountered annoying glitches and that he misses content from previous games, like dishwashers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-sims-aspires-greatness-fails-25226583|title=Entertainment News, Celebrity and Pop Culture - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref>\n\nKevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] gave this game a 6 out of 10. Despite praising the visuals, audio, and the new multi-tasking and moods system, he states that he misses the two main features of ''The Sims 3'': \"Create-a-Style\" and the open world. His conclusion is: \"''The Sims 4''{{'}}s biggest problem is that ''The Sims 3'' exists\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-4-review/1900-6415867/|title=The Sims 4 Review|author=Kevin VanOrd|work=GameSpot}}</ref>\n\nOther reviews were more favorable. [[CraveOnline]].co.uk mentioned in an article that \"the awful user reviews indicate a strong backlash;\" however, the website added that \"''Sims'' fans who haven't paid much attention to the ongoing controversy surrounding the game may look at those [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] review scores and, without knowing that many are immediately dismissing the game due to its cut content, decide that they won't purchase it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.co.uk/gaming/articles/753685-sims-4s-awful-user-reviews-indicate-strong-fan-backlash|title=The Sims 4's Awful User Reviews Indicate a Strong Fan Backlash - CraveOnline|work=CraveOnline}}</ref>\n\nKallie Plagge of [[IGN]] gave ''The Sims 4'' a 7.5 out of 10. She was disappointed by the lack of content from previous games, and the lack of \"cool\" objects that could adequately replace them; and the too frequent, albeit short, loading screens. The score she gave is relatively high, though, because \"''The Sims 4'' does succeed in being a deep and complex game when it comes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional potential [...] Plus, excellent building tools make architecture more fun than ever\". Her conclusion is that \"it's a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it's not there yet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/the-sims-4-review|title=The Sims 4 Review|work=IGN}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Jack Fleming praised the game for \"The Gallery\" feature that allows users to showcase their creations easily, the new multitasking system, the visual design, the personalities and emotions, the unusual careers (that, for example, allow the sim to travel into space), and the new build mode. On the other hand, he voiced his frustration with the loading screens, the new camera controls (while noting they can be reverted to ''The Sims 3'' style), and noted the lack of content from previous installments (such as swimming pools and toddlers) made many fans upset. In conclusion he writes: \"''The Sims 4'' is an easy game to get into (though the constant tutorial-ising at the start can actually get a bit frustrating) and the reasons that people love this series are still present. The game's creators have tried to make the appeal as diverse as possible and have in most ways succeeded; however, I couldn't help but wish I could actually go to space and drive that spaceship around...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/the-sims-4-review-want-more-from-life-create-a-sim-9714109.html|title=The Sims 4 review: want more from life?

He explains that the reason for ''Sims'' fans expressing so much anger and dissatisfaction with it is because people \"strongly prefer avoiding losses than acquiring gains\". That, combined with the [[Criticism of Electronic Arts|hatred for Electronic Arts]] that greatly intensified after the release of the latest ''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'' game, resulted in such a backlash. Tan gave ''The Sims 4'' a 3.5/5, calling it \"woefully incomplete, despite being unexpectedly solid and entertaining in its current state\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/the-sims-4|title=The Sims 4 Review|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{The Sims}}\n{{Sim series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sims 4, The}}\n[[Category:2014 video games]]\n[[Category:Electronic Arts games]]\n[[Category:Life simulation games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Python-scripted video games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Social simulation video games]]\n[[Category:The Sims]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender]]\n[[Category:Video games with downloadable content]]\n[[Category:Video games with custom soundtrack support]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Ghost video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n{{short description|2014 video game}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox video game <!---Let's try not to toss sources into the infobox; if new news has came out, place it into the prose and source it there.--->\n| title = The Sims 4\n| image = The Sims 4 Box Art.png{{!}}border\n| caption = Original Box Art\n| developer = [[Maxis]]{{efn|Blind Squirrel Entertainment co-developed the PS4 and Xbox One versions}}\n| publisher = [[Electronic Arts]]\n| series = ''[[The Sims]]''\n| platforms = {{ubl|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[macOS]]|[[PlayStation 4]]|[[Xbox One]]}}\n| released = '''Microsoft Windows'''{{Video game release|NA|September 2, 2014|AUS|September 4, 2014|EU|September 4, 2014|UK|September 5, 2014}}'''macOS'''{{Video game release|WW|February 17, 2015}}'''PlayStation 4, Xbox One'''{{Video game release|WW|November 14, 2017}}\n| genre = [[Simulation game|Simulation]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n| director = \n| producer = {{ubl|Kevin Gibson|Grant Rodiek|Ryan Michael Vaughan}}\n| designer = {{ubl|Eric Holmberg-Weidler|Matt Yang}}\n| programmer = \n| artist = {{ubl|Magnus Hollmo|Samantha Miceli|Steven Ross}}\n| writer = Danielle von Mayrhauser\n| composer = [[Ilan Eshkeri]]\n}}\n\n'''''The Sims 4''''' is a 2014 [[life simulation game|life simulation]] video game developed by the Redwood Shores studio of [[Maxis]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]].

By  clicking, dragging, and pulling with the mouse, players may directly manipulate the facial features of a Sim. Players can directly manipulate any body part including the abdomen, chest, legs, arms and feet. In previous Sims games, only the fitness and fatness can be manipulated on a Sims body; however, fitness and fatness levels may still be adjusted in ''The Sims 4'' with sliders as in previous games. The base game comes with over 40 hairstyles for both men and women. There are up to 18 hair color options per hairstyle. Selections of premade designs of Sims are available to choose from, which range in body shape and ethnicity.\n\nSeven life stages are available including baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult, adult and elder. The baby life stage is accessible only through the birth of a Sim and not available in Create A Sim.

There is a filter panel where clothing options can be sorted by color, material, outfit category, fashion choice, style, content and packs.\n\nIn a summer 2016 update, gender options were expanded in the game, allowing any gender expression.

He also complained of being \"harassed\" by tutorial messages. His final score for the game was 2.5 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"escapist\">{{cite web|last1=Sterling|first1=Jim|title=The Sims 4 Review&nbsp;\u2014 More BooHoo Than WooHoo|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/12201-The-Sims-4-Review.2|website=The Escapist|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[ABCNews.com]]'s reviewer Derrik J.

Despite praising the visuals, audio, and the new multi-tasking and moods system, he states that he misses the two main features of ''The Sims 3'': \"Create-a-Style\" and the open world.

[[CraveOnline]].co.uk mentioned in an article that \"the awful user reviews indicate a strong backlash;\" however, the website added that \"''Sims'' fans who haven't paid much attention to the ongoing controversy surrounding the game may look at those [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] review scores and, without knowing that many are immediately dismissing the game due to its cut content, decide that they won't purchase it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.co.uk/gaming/articles/753685-sims-4s-awful-user-reviews-indicate-strong-fan-backlash|title=The Sims 4's Awful User Reviews Indicate a Strong Fan Backlash - CraveOnline|work=CraveOnline}}</ref>\n\nKallie Plagge of [[IGN]] gave ''The Sims 4'' a 7.5 out of 10. She was disappointed by the lack of content from previous games, and the lack of \"cool\" objects that could adequately replace them; and the too frequent, albeit short, loading screens. The score she gave is relatively high, though, because \"''The Sims 4'' does succeed in being a deep and complex game when it comes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional potential [...] Plus, excellent building tools make architecture more fun than ever\". Her conclusion is that \"it's a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it's not there yet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/the-sims-4-review|title=The Sims 4 Review|work=IGN}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Jack Fleming praised the game for \"The Gallery\" feature that allows users to showcase their creations easily, the new multitasking system, the visual design, the personalities and emotions, the unusual careers (that, for example, allow the sim to travel into space), and the new build mode. On the other hand, he voiced his frustration with the loading screens, the new camera controls (while noting they can be reverted to ''The Sims 3'' style), and noted the lack of content from previous installments (such as swimming pools and toddlers) made many fans upset. In conclusion he writes: \"''The Sims 4'' is an easy game to get into (though the constant tutorial-ising at the start can actually get a bit frustrating) and the reasons that people love this series are still present. The game's creators have tried to make the appeal as diverse as possible and have in most ways succeeded; however, I couldn't help but wish I could actually go to space and drive that spaceship around...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/the-sims-4-review-want-more-from-life-create-a-sim-9714109.html|title=The Sims 4 review: want more from life?

He explains that the reason for ''Sims'' fans expressing so much anger and dissatisfaction with it is because people \"strongly prefer avoiding losses than acquiring gains\". That, combined with the [[Criticism of Electronic Arts|hatred for Electronic Arts]] that greatly intensified after the release of the latest ''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'' game, resulted in such a backlash.

Lady Byron's reminiscences, published after her death by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], revealed her fears about an alleged incest Lord Byron had with his half-sister. The scandal about Lady Byron's suspicions accelerated Byron's intentions to leave England and return to the Mediterranean where he had lived in 1810.\n\nTheir daughter [[Ada Lovelace|Ada]] worked as a mathematician with [[Charles Babbage]], the pioneer of computer science. Lady Byron had felt that an education in mathematics and logic would counteract any possible inherited tendency towards Lord Byron's perceived [[insanity]] and romantic excess.\n\n==Names==\nHer names were unusually complex. She was born Anne Isabella Milbanke the 1st, the only child of Sir Ralph Milbanke, 6th Baronet, and his wife the Hon. Judith Noel, sister of [[Thomas Noel, 2nd Viscount Wentworth|Thomas Noel, Viscount Wentworth]].<ref>Joan Pierson, 'Noel, Anne Isabella, suo jure Baroness Wentworth, and Lady Byron (1792\u20131860)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45789, accessed 11 Aug 2011]</ref> When Lord Wentworth died, a few months after her marriage to Lord Byron, Lady Milbanke and her cousin Lord Scarsdale jointly inherited his estate. The family subsequently took the surname Noel over Milbanke.\n\nLord Wentworth had been both a viscount and a baron. Upon his death the viscountcy became extinct, and the barony fell into [[abeyance]] between Lady Milbanke and Lord Scarsdale. After their deaths, the barony passed to Lady Byron, and she became Baroness Wentworth in her own right; however, she did not use the title. She signed her letters \"A. I. Noel Byron\" and her will as \"Baroness Noel-Byron\". The world knew her as \"Lady Byron\", and her friends and family called her by her nickname \"Annabella\".\n\n==Youth==\nShe was a gifted child. To cultivate her obvious intelligence, her parents hired as her tutor a former [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] professor by the name of [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]]. Under his direction, her education proceeded much like that of a Cambridge student; her studies involved classical literature, [[philosophy]], [[science]] and [[mathematics]], in which she particularly delighted. This fascination led her husband to nickname her his \"princess of [[parallelograms]]\".\n\nAnnabella developed into a stiff, religious woman with strict morals. She was aware of her strong intellect and was not ashamed to demonstrate it in her social realm. Often described as cold and prim, she seemed an unlikely match for the man who would become her ultimate obsession, the dramatically dark and \"morally fractured\" poet [[Lord Byron]]. Their first meeting occurred in March 1812. She later said to her mother that though she would not venture to introduce herself to Lord Byron, she would certainly accept his introduction if it were offered.\n\nByron's popularity was soaring following the success of his work ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]''. Annabella met him on many social occasions as he began a relationship with Caroline Lamb, the wife of her cousin, William Lamb. However, Byron was attracted to her modesty and intellect and in October 1812 he proposed marriage through her aunt, Lady Melbourne. In response, she wrote a summary of his character and three days later refused him. However, they were plagued with a persistent interest in each other.\n\nAlthough well aware of Byron's shortcomings, telling her mother \"He is a very bad, very good man\", she decided it was her religious obligation to support him and improve his behaviour.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/she-walked-in-beauty-1446842493 | title=She Walked in Beauty|work=Wall Street Journal | date=7 November 2015 | accessdate=6 November 2015 | author=Gordon, Charlotte}} {{paywalled}}</ref> In August 1813, she contacted him in writing for the first time. The letters continued into the next year, some offering reassurance and support during times when public opinion of him was not favorable, others describing the \"imperfect attachment\" she felt for him. During this time, he accepted an invitation from Sir Ralph Milbanke to visit [[Seaham Hall]], the family home in [[County Durham]].\n\n==Marriage==\nWhen George Gordon Byron proposed a second time, in September 1814, she was forced and did accept. The couple were married privately, and by special licence, at [[Seaham Hall]] in [[County Durham]] on 2 January 1815 (the officiating clergyman was her illegitimate cousin, the Rev. Thomas Noel of [[Kirkby Mallory]], natural son of her uncle, [[Thomas Noel, 2nd Viscount Wentworth|Viscount Wentworth]]). The couple lived at [[Piccadilly Terrace]] in London.\n\nByron was then in extreme financial distress. He rejected payments offered for his written works, as he believed business was not appropriate for a gentleman and gifted copyrights to people who had helped him. He was having difficulty selling his estates at [[Newstead Abbey]] and [[Rochdale]] to clear his debt. During the summer of 1815, he began to unleash his anger and hostility on his wife. His moods were dark and he began to drink heavily. In [[Byron's letters|a letter]] to his half-sister, [[Augusta Leigh]], he stated his suspicions that his wife had broken the lock on his desk and searched it. Later in the year he began an affair with [[Susan Boyce]], a London actress at Drury Lane Theatre where he was a director.\n\nAnnabella became increasingly upset. In the late stages of pregnancy, she feared her husband might be going mad. In November 1815, she wrote to Mrs Leigh and told her of Byron's moods and behaviour. In answer to her sister-in-law's letter, Mrs Leigh traveled to the Byrons' home to assist. Upon her arrival, she became the subject of Byron's wrath and believed him to be temporarily insane. On 10 December, Annabella gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named [[Ada Lovelace|Ada]]. Byron's despair seemed to increase.\n\n==Separation==\nIn January 1816, as the Byrons passed their first anniversary, Byron decided they must move from the rented house at Piccadilly Terrace. He recommended that Annabella take their daughter to her parents' home and stay there temporarily until he settled their finances. In disbelief, Anne sought medical advice, as she had become convinced her husband had gone mad. She invited a physician to their home to assess him; Byron was unaware of the true purpose for the visit. The doctor recommended she do as Byron requested and move to her parents' estate.\n\nAnnabella began a detailed documentation of her husband's behaviour, moods, and speech. She contacted his solicitor and friend, John Hanson, and told him her concerns that her husband would take his life. She also provided Hanson with a pamphlet on [[hydrocephalus]], accompanied by notes that suggested Byron could be suffering from this particular affliction. Following this conversation, she took Ada and travelled to her parents' residence at [[Kirkby Mallory]] in [[Leicestershire]]. She would not see her husband again.\n\n==Later life==\nDuring her first month away from him, Annabella wrote to Byron affectionately, addressing him as \"dearest Duck\". Her mother wrote to him and invited him to come to their home. However, her concern about him soon became paramount, and her parents sought legal counsel. Their attorney recommended a legal separation and sent Byron a letter proposing the separation. Augusta Leigh, who had remained with Byron at Piccadilly Terrace since his wife's departure, intercepted the letter, as she feared he would commit [[suicide]] if he knew of it. She returned the letter to Kirkby Mallory and communicated her opinion that greater consideration should be taken in the matter of the Byrons' marriage. A week later, however, a messenger sent Lord Byron the proposal again. \n{{Anti-Slavery Society Convention 1840|align=right|size=300px|caption=Lady Byron is to the far right of this painting of the 1840 [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]].}} \nThis time it reached him, but he refused to believe that she no longer wanted to be married to him. He asked Mrs Leigh to write to her; in addition, he refused to dissolve their marriage. A short while later, when Lady Byron made clear her suspicions that his relationship with his half-sister Augusta Leigh was incestuous (which was not then illegal) and that he had had homosexual relationships and had sodomised her - Lady Byron - which acts ''were'' illegal, he changed his mind.<ref>{{cite book| title=Augusta Leigh: Byron's Half Sister - A Biography| first1=Michael| last1=Bakewell| first2=Melissa| last2=Bakewell| date=2002| publisher=[[Chatto & Windus]]| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Augusta_Leigh_Byron_s_Half_Sister.html?id=cm-KQgAACAAJ| isbn=9780712665605}}</ref> He agreed to grant her request if she proved that the request for legal separation was truly hers and not that of her parents. In response, she personally communicated her feelings to Mrs Leigh. Byron kept his word, and their separation was made legal in March 1816, in a private settlement.\n\nFollowing the settlement, Augusta wrote to Annabella; the latter's solicitor replied to the private note. Byron was enraged by such cold treatment of his half-sister. Soon after the dissolution of his marriage, he left [[England]] and lived the remainder of his days abroad. Though she wished to separate from her husband, Annabella was obsessed by him until her death. She was motivated to save his soul and secure him a place in Heaven. In the years following their separation, she came to believe that the time she had spent with him guaranteed he would experience God's embrace upon his death. She kept his letters, copies of her own to him, and letters about him. She carefully documented their relationship, supposedly in preparation for any challenge Lord Byron might make for custody of their daughter.\n\nByron never sought custody of Ada, though he sent for both of them shortly before his death in [[Greece]] on 19 April 1824. Lady Byron's obsession with him did not end with his death. Ultimately her relationship with him defined her life, though she committed herself to social causes, such as [[prison reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]]. In furtherance of the latter, Lady Byron attended the 1840 [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]], where she was one of the few women included in its commemorative painting.<ref name=npg>[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp00224&rNo=0&role=sit The Anti-Slavery Society Convention], 1840, [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]], accessed 19 July 2008</ref><ref>The others were [[Elizabeth Pease Nichol|Elizabeth Pease]], [[Amelia Opie]], [[Anne Knight]], [[Mary Anne Rawson]], [[Mrs John Beaumont]], [[John Harfield Tredgold|Elizabeth Tredgold]], [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s daughter Mary and right at the back [[Lucretia Mott]].</ref>\n\n[[Lady Byron]] lived in [[Ealing]] between around 1822 and 1840, and established Ealing Grove School in 1833.<ref>[http://ealingnewsextra.co.uk/history/lady-byron-ada-lovelace-ealing/]</ref>\n\n==Daughter==\n{{Main|Ada Lovelace}}\nAs her daughter grew up, Lady Byron feared she might inherit her father's behaviours and dark moods. She schooled Ada in science and mathematics and discouraged literary study. Though her effort was great, it eventually seemed in vain: [[Ada Lovelace]] embodied many of her father's rebellious qualities. She is also considered to have been the world's first [[computer programmer]], having written the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine\u2014[[Charles Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]].\n\nAda married at nineteen years of age, had three children, and amassed considerable gambling debts before dying from [[cancer]] on 27 November 1852. Lady Byron attended her daughter's deathbed and, under her influence, Ada underwent a religious conversion. Ada was 36 years old when she died, the same age as Byron when he died.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Reformers Monument, Kensal Green Cemetery (detail).JPG|thumb|Anne is listed as Lady Noel Byron on the Reformers Monument, [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]]]\nLady Byron died of breast cancer on 16 May 1860, the day before her 68th birthday.

She is also considered to have been the world's first [[computer programmer]], having written the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine\u2014[[Charles Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]].\n\nAda married at nineteen years of age, had three children, and amassed considerable gambling debts before dying from [[cancer]] on 27 November 1852.

With his chemical background, Pipkin was posted to the Army's Gas Defense Department at General Electric's [[Nela Park]] in [[Cleveland]].{{sfn|Keating|1954|p=119}} The principles embodied in Pipkin's gas mask innovations remained in use throughout the twentieth century.<ref name=prominent/> He was promoted to the \"senior grade rank of Master Engineer\".{{Citation needed|reason=\"senior grade rank of Master Engineer\" needs clarification and explanation|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Nela Park===\nHe remained at Nela Park after the war, and worked in General Electric\u2019s bulb development department.<ref name=Peggy/>\n\n== Light bulb innovations ==\nThe public felt that the glare from clear transparent incandescent lamps gave off a harshness that was unwanted by most people. Another side effect was that they made it hard to see objects in immediate vicinity of the lamp. They desired a lamp that had a softer light with no glare. In 1920, General Electric developed a 30 watt light bulb that had outside etching as a frosting effect for the electric lamp. It effectively [[diffusion|diffused]] the light to make it softer; however, it decreased the light produced by 15\u201325 percent. Another problem with the lamp was that fluorides came off in the sealing of the lamp and attacked the tungsten filament.<ref name=prominent/> External etching of the globe bulb weakened it. The rough outside surface collected dust and dirt and was difficult to clean. The globes of the bulb were brittle and would often break with just ordinary handling.{{sfn|Payne|1927|p=25}}\n\nWhen Pipkin went to work for General Electric he was assigned the \"impossible\" task of finding a way to frost electric light bulbs on the inside without weakening the strength of the glass. Not being aware his assignment was a type of joke, he went about the task as if it was something that could be done and had been done before.{{sfn|Lynn|1973|p=57}} In 1925, Pipkin produced an innovative  acid etching process for the inside of the globe of an electric lamp so that it did not deteriorate the lamp glass globe.{{sfn|Hendrickson III|2014|p=564}}<ref name=NotPeople>{{cite web |url= http://cypresstraceproperty.com/history-2/notable-people/ |title= Notable People |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website= |publisher= The Estates of Cypress Trace |access-date=December 21, 2017 |quote=Marvin Pipkin is best known as the inventor of the inside-frost process of bulbs for incandescent lamps, which was developed in 1925, as well as the improved process developed in 1947, which consisted of an application of silica to the inside of a bulb.}}</ref> His was a two step acid process that etched the interior of glass with tiny crevasses on the first process as was the normal procedure done by other science engineers, but he added a second acid step that caused soft, rounded dimples from the crevasses which gave the bulbs added strength. There was minimal loss of diffusion of light with his innovation.{{sfn|Lynn|1973|p=57}} It left the outside of the globe of the glass lamp smooth that did not hold dust like a rough surface one did.{{sfn|Cox|1979|p=71}}{{sfn|Federal Cases|1937|p=887}} The first electric light bulb frosted on the inside with sufficient strength for ordinary handling that could be sold to the public was invented by Pipkin in 1925.{{sfn|Kane|1964|p=229}}{{sfn|Ohio Engineer|1951|p=11}}{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1955|p=185}}\n\nThis idea of having a second treatment to smooth out the fine-grained texture to dimples came about by an accident. Pipkin would often clean out the experimental bulbs with another solution of the acid, but in a weaker solution. If he let the filled bulb set for a while with this weaker solution it would clean out the etching previously done and return the glass globe to be transparent again. This saved the bulbs so they wouldn't be thrown away and could be experimented with again. One day, while he was pouring the weaker solution into a bulb, the phone rang. In the process of answering the phone, he accidentally tipped the bulb over before it had enough time to finish cleaning out the previous etching. When he returned to his work, he accidentally knocked the glass bulb off the workbench and onto the floor. To his surprise it did not shatter, as etched bulbs normally did, but bounced a few times and then rolled under the workbench. Pipkin was surprised to find that the bulb glass had somehow become much stronger. As it turned out, a short bath in the weaker cleaning solution, taken out before it had a chance to remove the etching, caused the etching of the first frosting treatment to form dimples in the etching, that strengthened the glass.{{sfn|Payne|1927|p=24}}\n\nPipkin then did a demonstration of the bulbs' integrity to his supervisor at General Electric.<ref name=FrostHistory>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Light Bulb has interior frost |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15969503/ |work= The San Bernardino County Sun| page =2 \u00a0|location= San Bernardino, California |date= January 21, 1928 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}</ref> He presented to his supervisor six light bulbs that had been frosted on the inside. Some had just the one application of acid and others with his reinforced second treatment innovation, strengthening the glass globe. He placed the bulbs on his supervisor\u2019s desk, standing up on their screw bottoms. He tipped the first three over, one at a time, to simulate a bulb being dropped from a small height. These were the bulbs treated with original single acid application, and as expected, all three bulbs shattered. He then tipped over the remaining three bulbs, which were tempered with his new two-step acid treatment. They remained unbroken, much to the surprise of his supervisor. Then, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of his tempering process, Pipkin took bulbs that had not shattered and dropped them again, this time allowing them to fall to the office floor. The bulbs bounced on the floor, and settled without breaking. This demonstrated Pipkin's innovation of a two-step acid etching process for frosting a glass light bulb interior, and creating a strong glass globe.<ref name=FrostHistory/> Pipkin's new frosted bulb revolutionized the industry, allowing the manufacture of frosted bulbs, that diffused the light without losing much intensity, and were strong enough to be commercially viable.{{sfn|Kane|1964|p=229}}{{sfn|Ohio Engineer|1951|p=11}}{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1955|p=185}}  He went on to make many innovations to the light bulb and two decades later developed the soft white light bulb.<ref name=Schenectady>{{cite web |url=http://www.schenectadymuseum.org/edison/c_modules/module_identify/A51.htm |title=Marvin Pipkin |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 2017|website= |publisher=Schenectady Museum Association |access-date=December 20, 2017 |quote=He continued to work at NELA for many more years and eventually created the Soft-White light bulb nearly 25 years later.}}</ref>\n\nPipkin in 1947 invented an improved version of the process with silica coating that replaced the internal acid etching process.{{sfn|Bonnier Corp|1949|p=125}} The 1947 smoke-thin internal silica coating lasted for 30 years and had the trade name of Q coat.{{sfn|Keating|1954|p=226}} The 100-watt Deluxe Soft-White light bulb was made from this.

Another side effect was that they made it hard to see objects in immediate vicinity of the lamp. They desired a lamp that had a softer light with no glare. In 1920, General Electric developed a 30 watt light bulb that had outside etching as a frosting effect for the electric lamp. It effectively [[diffusion|diffused]] the light to make it softer; however, it decreased the light produced by 15\u201325 percent. Another problem with the lamp was that fluorides came off in the sealing of the lamp and attacked the tungsten filament.<ref name=prominent/> External etching of the globe bulb weakened it. The rough outside surface collected dust and dirt and was difficult to clean. The globes of the bulb were brittle and would often break with just ordinary handling.{{sfn|Payne|1927|p=25}}\n\nWhen Pipkin went to work for General Electric he was assigned the \"impossible\" task of finding a way to frost electric light bulbs on the inside without weakening the strength of the glass. Not being aware his assignment was a type of joke, he went about the task as if it was something that could be done and had been done before.{{sfn|Lynn|1973|p=57}} In 1925, Pipkin produced an innovative  acid etching process for the inside of the globe of an electric lamp so that it did not deteriorate the lamp glass globe.{{sfn|Hendrickson III|2014|p=564}}<ref name=NotPeople>{{cite web |url= http://cypresstraceproperty.com/history-2/notable-people/ |title= Notable People |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website= |publisher= The Estates of Cypress Trace |access-date=December 21, 2017 |quote=Marvin Pipkin is best known as the inventor of the inside-frost process of bulbs for incandescent lamps, which was developed in 1925, as well as the improved process developed in 1947, which consisted of an application of silica to the inside of a bulb.}}</ref> His was a two step acid process that etched the interior of glass with tiny crevasses on the first process as was the normal procedure done by other science engineers, but he added a second acid step that caused soft, rounded dimples from the crevasses which gave the bulbs added strength. There was minimal loss of diffusion of light with his innovation.{{sfn|Lynn|1973|p=57}} It left the outside of the globe of the glass lamp smooth that did not hold dust like a rough surface one did.{{sfn|Cox|1979|p=71}}{{sfn|Federal Cases|1937|p=887}} The first electric light bulb frosted on the inside with sufficient strength for ordinary handling that could be sold to the public was invented by Pipkin in 1925.{{sfn|Kane|1964|p=229}}{{sfn|Ohio Engineer|1951|p=11}}{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1955|p=185}}\n\nThis idea of having a second treatment to smooth out the fine-grained texture to dimples came about by an accident. Pipkin would often clean out the experimental bulbs with another solution of the acid, but in a weaker solution. If he let the filled bulb set for a while with this weaker solution it would clean out the etching previously done and return the glass globe to be transparent again. This saved the bulbs so they wouldn't be thrown away and could be experimented with again. One day, while he was pouring the weaker solution into a bulb, the phone rang. In the process of answering the phone, he accidentally tipped the bulb over before it had enough time to finish cleaning out the previous etching. When he returned to his work, he accidentally knocked the glass bulb off the workbench and onto the floor. To his surprise it did not shatter, as etched bulbs normally did, but bounced a few times and then rolled under the workbench. Pipkin was surprised to find that the bulb glass had somehow become much stronger. As it turned out, a short bath in the weaker cleaning solution, taken out before it had a chance to remove the etching, caused the etching of the first frosting treatment to form dimples in the etching, that strengthened the glass.{{sfn|Payne|1927|p=24}}\n\nPipkin then did a demonstration of the bulbs' integrity to his supervisor at General Electric.<ref name=FrostHistory>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Light Bulb has interior frost |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15969503/ |work= The San Bernardino County Sun| page =2 \u00a0|location= San Bernardino, California |date= January 21, 1928 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}</ref> He presented to his supervisor six light bulbs that had been frosted on the inside. Some had just the one application of acid and others with his reinforced second treatment innovation, strengthening the glass globe. He placed the bulbs on his supervisor\u2019s desk, standing up on their screw bottoms. He tipped the first three over, one at a time, to simulate a bulb being dropped from a small height. These were the bulbs treated with original single acid application, and as expected, all three bulbs shattered. He then tipped over the remaining three bulbs, which were tempered with his new two-step acid treatment. They remained unbroken, much to the surprise of his supervisor. Then, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of his tempering process, Pipkin took bulbs that had not shattered and dropped them again, this time allowing them to fall to the office floor. The bulbs bounced on the floor, and settled without breaking. This demonstrated Pipkin's innovation of a two-step acid etching process for frosting a glass light bulb interior, and creating a strong glass globe.<ref name=FrostHistory/> Pipkin's new frosted bulb revolutionized the industry, allowing the manufacture of frosted bulbs, that diffused the light without losing much intensity, and were strong enough to be commercially viable.{{sfn|Kane|1964|p=229}}{{sfn|Ohio Engineer|1951|p=11}}{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1955|p=185}}  He went on to make many innovations to the light bulb and two decades later developed the soft white light bulb.<ref name=Schenectady>{{cite web |url=http://www.schenectadymuseum.org/edison/c_modules/module_identify/A51.htm |title=Marvin Pipkin |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 2017|website= |publisher=Schenectady Museum Association |access-date=December 20, 2017 |quote=He continued to work at NELA for many more years and eventually created the Soft-White light bulb nearly 25 years later.}}</ref>\n\nPipkin in 1947 invented an improved version of the process with silica coating that replaced the internal acid etching process.{{sfn|Bonnier Corp|1949|p=125}} The 1947 smoke-thin internal silica coating lasted for 30 years and had the trade name of Q coat.{{sfn|Keating|1954|p=226}} The 100-watt Deluxe Soft-White light bulb was made from this.

{"title_page": "Marriage customs in Africa", "text_new": "__FORCETOC__\n[[Marriage]] ceremonies within Africa vary greatly between countries due to the diversity of culture and religion throughout the continent. Africa has a population of over 1.2 billion people spread throughout 52 countries.<ref>Worldometers.info. (2019). Population of Africa). Retrieved from https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/africa-population/</ref> The large size and extreme diversity of the continent leads to enormous diversity among the marriage ceremonies and traditions that take place. Marriage ceremonies throughout [[Africa]] vary greatly depending on the faith of the individuals. [[The World Book Encyclopedia]] states that 40% of Africans identify as Christian while 45% are Muslim.<ref>World Book, Inc.,. (2018). The World Book encyclopedia</ref> It is common practice in Africa to combine practices of major religions with local religious traditions.<ref>Riggs, T. (2006). Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices: Religions and denominations. P. 1.</ref> This is evident in marriage ceremonies where both [[Islamic]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] marriages will also follow traditional practices adopted from tribal communities or smaller religions. The wedding is an exceptionally respected tradition within Africa due to their deeply rooted appreciation for the notion of family. Many African communities believe marriage is primarily about procreation and providing for children as this is seen as the foundation of society. They are often encouraged against marrying for love or sexual attraction.\n\n==Diversity of African weddings==\n{{See also|History of Africa}}\nDue to the sheer size and diversity of Africa, wedding customs vary greatly not just between countries but between local communities. There is a growing trend among African communities where wedding ceremonies and marriage processes are blending traditional customs with modern practices. This is evident throughout many locations within Africa, where Catholic and Islamic followers will participate in traditional customs as well as ones typical to their religion. The diversity of traditional beliefs throughout the country leads to enormous diversity among African communities. Despite this, there are also many similarities between African weddings and the customs that surround them.\n\n==Ceremony and traditions==\n\nThe various marriage ceremonies performed in Africa begin with the initial introduction between the [[groom]] and [[bride]]. The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] call this \u2018Mo mi i mo e\u2019 (know me and let me know you) while the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] call it \u2018Ikutu aka n\u2019ulo\u2019 (Knock on the door). The family is typically involved within this process. Within many African communities, such as [[Nigerian]] ethnic groups, the engagement is where the traditional practices are performed.<ref name=nigeria>Solanke, S., Ayodabo, S. (2017). Contemporary Marriage Processes in Nigeria: Willing Love, Perilous Business, Post-Marriage Problems. Modern Research Studies: An International Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 4. 339-361</ref> It consists of an elaborate ceremony with heavy involvement from both families. The families dress in traditional and often colourful attire. It is common for the families to choose a colour to abide to in their dress code. The ceremony is typically held at the Bride's house. It is here that payment from the groom's family to the bride's is made and wedding rings are exchanged. Traditional customs relevant to the specific community are performed during this engagement ceremony, while the more modern marital customs will be performed at the religious wedding ceremony.<ref name=nigeria /> The wedding will consist of more modern marital customs relevant to the religion of the participants families. Examples of this include the exchange of marital vows and modern wedding attire being worn by the bride and groom.\n\nAfrican weddings often consist of modern Islamic/Christian ceremonies whilst intertwining traditional African beliefs and practices. An example of this is the common practice of [[bridewealth]] in Africa, particularly among the [[Zulu people]]. Bridewealth is when a groom's family pays the bride's family in traditional forms such as livestock, food and clothing to confirm the marriage. In modern practice, the payment is typically in forms of cash. To many Africans, bridewealth is considered to be a crucial part of a marriage ceremony and the marriage will not be acknowledged until the bridewealth has been paid.<ref>Posel, D., & Rudwick, S. (2014). Marriage and Bridewealth (Ilobolo) in Contemporary Zulu Society. African Studies Review, 57, pp 51-72 doi:10.1017/asr.2014.47</ref> While this is not a custom of Islamic or Christian marriage, many Africans adopt the traditional practice into their communities creating a strong link between their primary religion and their traditional and cultural beliefs. Enormous economic growth within the continent has caused the bridewealth payment to inflate so significantly that many couples are now straying from the tradition, instead opting for other forms of marriage.<ref name=Rachel>Jean-Baptiste, R., & Burrill, E. (2019). LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND FAMILIES IN AFRICA. In Achebe N. & Robertson C. (Eds.), Holding the World Together: African Women in Changing Perspective (pp. 275-293). Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press.</ref> The amount of bridewealth that a family is able to pay serves as an icon of her family's social status and indicates how much the family will be able to support the groom's. Bridewealth is seen as a form of \u201cinsurance\u201d for the bride's family, as they know that if economic hardship entails they are able to rely on the groom's family to care of them. Some academics believe bridewealth leads to marriage stability, as the bride's family will put pressure on the daughter to remain in the marriage if the payment made was of significant value.<ref>Ogbu, J. (1978). African Bridewealth and Women's Status. American Ethnologist, 5(2), 241-262.</ref> In contrast to this practice, other African communities such as many [[Morocco|Moroccan]] ethnic groups participate in a marital custom known as \u201c[[dowry]]\u201d. This is where the bride inherits gifts from her family with the purpose of using them within her new home.\n\nExamples of traditional marriage customs within Africa can be seen when analyzing the Yoruba people of Nigeria. The Yoruba integrate many traditional Yoruba marriage customs (such as arranged marriages and bridewealth) into their Christian and Islamic ceremonies.<ref name=OgomaD>Ogoma, D. (2014). Reflection on an African Traditional Marriage System. Journal of Social Sciences and Public Affairs, 4(1), 94-104.</ref> Marriage to this ethnic group is seen to be the foundation of their society rather than a bond between two people expressing love for one another. They are taught from a young age that marriage is about responsibility and providing to their society by having children. Children are taught through [[Folklore|folktales]] that families built on love and attraction risk damaging the foundation of their community.<ref name=Rachel /> It is cemented into their culture that marriage is about [[procreation]] and providing the child with an environment in which they can thrive. It is of traditional belief that the child does not know when he is ready to marry, therefore the parents will make the decision for them. The Yoruba teach proverbs such as \u201c\u201cBi omode ba to loko, aa fun loko, bi o ba to l\u2019ada, aa fun l\u2019ada\u201d which translates to \u201cwhen a child is ripe for hoe, he is given a hoe, if he is ripe for cutlass, he is given cutlass\u201d.<ref name=OgomaD /> When the parents believe the child is \u201cripe\u201d for marriage, they will begin the process of seeking out a wife, often without the child knowing. The wife will also be sent a school where she is educated on her roles as a wife and importance of marriage. The traditional beliefs of the Yoruba share some similarities with traditional Catholic marriages, such as the wife being expected to remain a virgin until she is married. Marriage to the Yoruba was not focused on love but rather on structure and order. Some African academics have argued that this is a strong foundation for a society and that it is the woman's role to attend to household duties.<ref name=OgomaD /> This standpoint is particularly polarizing and has not been backed up by scientific data.\n\nThe West African people of [[Ghana]] participate in marital customs that differ greatly from many other African countries. Generally, the woman would not live with her husband and would remain living with her parents.<ref name=Omari>Omari, T. (1960). Changing Attitudes of Students in West African Society toward Marriage and Family Relationships. The British Journal of Sociology, 11(3), 197-210. doi:10.2307/586746</ref> The married couple would have fairly minimal interaction with one another, to such an extent that the wife would often refer to her husband as the father of her sons name.<ref name=Omari /> This form of relationship emphasizes the importance of marriage towards social stability and minimizes the significance of the bond between the husband and wife.\n\nDue to Africa's expansive diversity, marriages within the continent are not limited to previously mentioned forms of marriage. Throughout the continent many individuals are electing for non-traditional forms of marriage that do not abide to traditional African marriage customs or more modern religious customs. This includes marriages performed in front of a [[Civil registry|registrar]], bypassing the religious and traditional aspects of marriage entirely and instead opting for a simplified process which still provides the legal benefits of marriage. Some African couples are opting to bypass the legal marriage status entirely and alternatively having irregular unions as a symbol of their love and connection. Some academics believe this may not be a choice, but rather the outcome of current living conditions within the continent.<ref name=phillip>Mitchell, P. (1954). The Survey of African Marriage and Family Life. Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, 24(2), 149-156.</ref> Many Africans are unable to produce the money required to fund a traditional wedding and pay dowry. They may perform their own simplified ceremonies as a response to their economic conditions. Other Africans are unable to participate in tribal or community centric ceremonies as they are required to move far from their community for employment.<ref name=phillip /> These irregular unions are performed when travelling back to their community was unrealistic or unachievable. The significance of marriage forming the foundation of a community is made obsolete if the couple were no longer a part of this community.\n\n==Changing attitudes among Africans==\n\nAfrica is going through a rapid state of change and development, both in an economic sense and a social sense. Alongside this comes a shift in attitude towards marriage and relationships. Studies performed on students within Ghana showed strong evidence suggesting that young people within Africa are drawn towards civil or religious marriages as opposed to traditional marriages.<ref name=Omari/> The study revealed that men were more likely to want a traditional marriage than women.\n\nPolygamy is heavily integrated into traditional Ghanaian marriage.

Africa has a population of over 1.2 billion people spread throughout 52 countries.<ref>Worldometers.info. (2019). Population of Africa). Retrieved from https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/africa-population/</ref> The large size and extreme diversity of the continent leads to enormous diversity among the marriage ceremonies and traditions that take place. Marriage ceremonies throughout [[Africa]] vary greatly depending on the faith of the individuals. [[The World Book Encyclopedia]] states that 40% of Africans identify as Christian while 45% are Muslim.<ref>World Book, Inc.,. (2018). The World Book encyclopedia</ref> It is common practice in Africa to combine practices of major religions with local religious traditions.<ref>Riggs, T. (2006). Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices: Religions and denominations. P. 1.</ref> This is evident in marriage ceremonies where both [[Islamic]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] marriages will also follow traditional practices adopted from tribal communities or smaller religions. The wedding is an exceptionally respected tradition within Africa due to their deeply rooted appreciation for the notion of family. Many African communities believe marriage is primarily about procreation and providing for children as this is seen as the foundation of society. They are often encouraged against marrying for love or sexual attraction.\n\n==Diversity of African weddings==\n{{See also|History of Africa}}\nDue to the sheer size and diversity of Africa, wedding customs vary greatly not just between countries but between local communities. There is a growing trend among African communities where wedding ceremonies and marriage processes are blending traditional customs with modern practices. This is evident throughout many locations within Africa, where Catholic and Islamic followers will participate in traditional customs as well as ones typical to their religion. The diversity of traditional beliefs throughout the country leads to enormous diversity among African communities. Despite this, there are also many similarities between African weddings and the customs that surround them.\n\n==Ceremony and traditions==\n\nThe various marriage ceremonies performed in Africa begin with the initial introduction between the [[groom]] and [[bride]]. The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] call this \u2018Mo mi i mo e\u2019 (know me and let me know you) while the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] call it \u2018Ikutu aka n\u2019ulo\u2019 (Knock on the door). The family is typically involved within this process. Within many African communities, such as [[Nigerian]] ethnic groups, the engagement is where the traditional practices are performed.<ref name=nigeria>Solanke, S., Ayodabo, S. (2017). Contemporary Marriage Processes in Nigeria: Willing Love, Perilous Business, Post-Marriage Problems. Modern Research Studies: An International Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 4. 339-361</ref> It consists of an elaborate ceremony with heavy involvement from both families. The families dress in traditional and often colourful attire. It is common for the families to choose a colour to abide to in their dress code. The ceremony is typically held at the Bride's house. It is here that payment from the groom's family to the bride's is made and wedding rings are exchanged. Traditional customs relevant to the specific community are performed during this engagement ceremony, while the more modern marital customs will be performed at the religious wedding ceremony.<ref name=nigeria /> The wedding will consist of more modern marital customs relevant to the religion of the participants families. Examples of this include the exchange of marital vows and modern wedding attire being worn by the bride and groom.\n\nAfrican weddings often consist of modern Islamic/Christian ceremonies whilst intertwining traditional African beliefs and practices. An example of this is the common practice of [[bridewealth]] in Africa, particularly among the [[Zulu people]]. Bridewealth is when a groom's family pays the bride's family in traditional forms such as livestock, food and clothing to confirm the marriage. In modern practice, the payment is typically in forms of cash. To many Africans, bridewealth is considered to be a crucial part of a marriage ceremony and the marriage will not be acknowledged until the bridewealth has been paid.<ref>Posel, D., & Rudwick, S. (2014). Marriage and Bridewealth (Ilobolo) in Contemporary Zulu Society. African Studies Review, 57, pp 51-72 doi:10.1017/asr.2014.47</ref> While this is not a custom of Islamic or Christian marriage, many Africans adopt the traditional practice into their communities creating a strong link between their primary religion and their traditional and cultural beliefs. Enormous economic growth within the continent has caused the bridewealth payment to inflate so significantly that many couples are now straying from the tradition, instead opting for other forms of marriage.<ref name=Rachel>Jean-Baptiste, R., & Burrill, E. (2019). LOVE, MARRIAGE, AND FAMILIES IN AFRICA. In Achebe N. & Robertson C. (Eds.), Holding the World Together: African Women in Changing Perspective (pp. 275-293). Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press.</ref> The amount of bridewealth that a family is able to pay serves as an icon of her family's social status and indicates how much the family will be able to support the groom's. Bridewealth is seen as a form of \u201cinsurance\u201d for the bride's family, as they know that if economic hardship entails they are able to rely on the groom's family to care of them. Some academics believe bridewealth leads to marriage stability, as the bride's family will put pressure on the daughter to remain in the marriage if the payment made was of significant value.<ref>Ogbu, J. (1978). African Bridewealth and Women's Status. American Ethnologist, 5(2), 241-262.</ref> In contrast to this practice, other African communities such as many [[Morocco|Moroccan]] ethnic groups participate in a marital custom known as \u201c[[dowry]]\u201d. This is where the bride inherits gifts from her family with the purpose of using them within her new home.\n\nExamples of traditional marriage customs within Africa can be seen when analyzing the Yoruba people of Nigeria. The Yoruba integrate many traditional Yoruba marriage customs (such as arranged marriages and bridewealth) into their Christian and Islamic ceremonies.<ref name=OgomaD>Ogoma, D. (2014). Reflection on an African Traditional Marriage System. Journal of Social Sciences and Public Affairs, 4(1), 94-104.</ref> Marriage to this ethnic group is seen to be the foundation of their society rather than a bond between two people expressing love for one another. They are taught from a young age that marriage is about responsibility and providing to their society by having children. Children are taught through [[Folklore|folktales]] that families built on love and attraction risk damaging the foundation of their community.<ref name=Rachel /> It is cemented into their culture that marriage is about [[procreation]] and providing the child with an environment in which they can thrive. It is of traditional belief that the child does not know when he is ready to marry, therefor the parents will make the decision for them. The Yoruba teach proverbs such as \u201c\u201cBi omode ba to loko, aa fun loko, bi o ba to l\u2019ada, aa fun l\u2019ada\u201d which translates to \u201cwhen a child is ripe for hoe, he is given a hoe, if he is ripe for cutlass, he is given cutlass\u201d.<ref name=OgomaD /> When the parents believe the child is \u201cripe\u201d for marriage, they will begin the process of seeking out a wife, often without the child knowing. The wife will also be sent a school where she is educated on her roles as a wife and importance of marriage. The traditional beliefs of the Yoruba share some similarities with traditional Catholic marriages, such as the wife being expected to remain a virgin until she is married. Marriage to the Yoruba was not focused on love but rather on structure and order. Some African academics have argued that this is a strong foundation for a society and that it is the woman's role to attend to household duties.<ref name=OgomaD /> This standpoint is particularly polarizing and has not been backed up by scientific data.\n\nThe West African people of [[Ghana]] participate in marital customs that differ greatly from many other African countries. Generally, the woman would not live with her husband and would remain living with her parents.<ref name=Omari>Omari, T. (1960). Changing Attitudes of Students in West African Society toward Marriage and Family Relationships. The British Journal of Sociology, 11(3), 197-210. doi:10.2307/586746</ref> The married couple would have fairly minimal interaction with one another, to such an extent that the wife would often refer to her husband as the father of her sons name.<ref name=Omari /> This form of relationship emphasizes the importance of marriage towards social stability and minimizes the significance of the bond between the husband and wife.\n\nDue to Africa's expansive diversity, marriages within the continent are not limited to previously mentioned forms of marriage. Throughout the continent many individuals are electing for non-traditional forms of marriage that do not abide to traditional African marriage customs or more modern religious customs. This includes marriages performed in front of a [[Civil registry|registrar]], bypassing the religious and traditional aspects of marriage entirely and instead opting for a simplified process which still provides the legal benefits of marriage. Some African couples are opting to bypass the legal marriage status entirely and alternatively having irregular unions as a symbol of their love and connection. Some academics believe this may not be a choice, but rather the outcome of current living conditions within the continent.<ref name=phillip>Mitchell, P. (1954). The Survey of African Marriage and Family Life. Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, 24(2), 149-156.</ref> Many Africans are unable to produce the money required to fund a traditional wedding and pay dowry. They may perform their own simplified ceremonies as a response to their economic conditions. Other Africans are unable to participate in tribal or community centric ceremonies as they are required to move far from their community for employment.<ref name=phillip /> These irregular unions are performed when travelling back to their community was unrealistic or unachievable. The significance of marriage forming the foundation of a community is made obsolete if the couple were no longer a part of this community.\n\n==Changing attitudes among Africans==\n\nAfrica is going through a rapid state of change and development, both in an economic sense and a social sense. Alongside this comes a shift in attitude towards marriage and relationships. Studies performed on students within Ghana showed strong evidence suggesting that young people within Africa are drawn towards civil or religious marriages as opposed to traditional marriages.<ref name=Omari/> The study revealed that men were more likely to want a traditional marriage than women.\n\nPolygamy is heavily integrated into traditional Ghanaian marriage. The study also revealed that 73% of young people surveyed believe that [[polygamy]] is an outdated process.<ref name=Omari /> The results also show that 87% of students believe love is the most important factor of marriage, despite that in traditional Ghanaian culture, marriage and love share a relatively loose connection.<ref name=Omari />\n\nWithin Ghana, it is common for the [[maternal]] uncle to pay dowry. 90% of surveyed students disagreed with this practice, believing the father should pay the dowry and pay for the costs of the child (such as education).<ref name=Omari /> A large majority of these students defended their answer by stating that everyone has a father while not everyone has an uncle. The researchers believe this may be due to a lack of support from their uncles with only 22% of students stating that their uncle had helped them throughout their education.<ref name=Omari />\n\nThe results show a dramatic shift away from traditional beliefs within African communities, with young people holding more progressive attitudes towards relationships and marriage. The rapid economic advancement of Africa is having an enormous impact on the youth and the attitudes they hold towards marriage.\n\n==Clothing==\n[[File:Tmp-cam-7327580579878436180.jpg|thumb|Nigerian wedding attire]]\n\nTo most African populations, clothing is a significant part of the engagement ceremony and the religious marriage ceremony.

Players move characters from screen to screen exploring dungeons, battling enemies, collecting items and solving puzzles. When the player's health bar is full, the player's sword will grow to tremendous sizes whenever swung. Swords in-game can be customized and leveled up to increase its length, width, as well as magical power, other special items that can also be used include [[boomerangs]], [[lanterns]], [[candles]], and [[bow (weapon)|bows]].<ref name=\"IGN Preview\"/>\n\nPlayers can create their own character model using the game's 3D sprite editor. Players are able to collect monsters to be featured in an encyclopedia which is done through beating the monster on its head with a book until its profile shows up in the encyclopedia's pages. Loading screens in-game feature recreated box arts of classic video games using the game's 3D sprites.<ref name=\"IGN Preview\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe game follows a hero on a quest to rid the Dotnia Kingdom of a dark plague caused by the forces of evil in order to restore peace to the land. Legend tells of an evil king known as the Dark King Onyx who brought tragedy and darkness to the kingdom by stealing six magical orbs. However a hero rose up against the Dark King and with his legendary sword as well as the power of the orbs, he sealed Onyx away within another orb. However, the forces of evil rose again as the Dark Bishop Fuelle stole the orb and threw the Kingdom of Dotnia into a state of chaos once more. The game's main protagonist is the grandchild of the brave hero who sealed away the Dark King and thus is entrusted with the responsibility to save the land.<ref name=\"Famitsu\"/>\n\nThe kingdom was once a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Pixelation|pixelated]] world but as the King of the Land felt that [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] were outdated he thus decreed for the kingdom to make the switch to [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. This caused the entire world to become 3D while still retaining its original pixelated look.<ref name=\"IGN Preview\">{{cite web |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/104/1045698p1.html |title=3D Dot Game Heroes Preview |author=Ryan Clements |date=November 17, 2009 |website=IGN |accessdate=November 21, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091121005950/http://ps3.ign.com/articles/104/1045698p1.html| archivedate= 21 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nSilicon Studio developed ''3D Dot Game Heroes'' in just 10 months despite none of the development team having prior experience with PS3 development.
