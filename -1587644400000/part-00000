He said to him, 'When he visits you, bring him to me.' When he arrived, he saw that he wore no head-covering. 'Why do you not have head-covering?', he asked.

Thereupon, he [Rabbi Huna] turned his face away from him, and said, 'See to it that you do not appear before me again before you are married.'<ref>Tractate Kiddushin 29b</ref>\n\nThe Tanakh implies that covering one's head is a sign of mourning:\n{{quote|And [[David]] went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went, and his head was covered and he walked barefoot.

The [[Vilna Gaon]] said one can make a ''[[berakhah]]'' without a kippah, since wearing a kippah is only an ''midos chassidus'' (\"exemplary attribute\"). Recently, there has been an effort to suppress earlier sources that practiced this leniency, including erasing lenient [[responsa]] from newly published books.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Yarmulke: A historic cover up?|journal=Flatbush Journal of Jewish Law|url=http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%204%20Rabinowitz.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Rabbi [[Isaac Klein]], a Conservative Jew ought to cover his head when in the synagogue, at prayer or sacred study, when engaging in a ritual act, and when eating.<ref>Klein, Isaac.

Originally used by choice among Jews to distinguish themselves, it was later made compulsory in some places by Christian governments as a discriminatory measure. In the early 19th century in the United States, rabbis often wore a scholar's cap (large saucer-shaped caps of cloth, like a beret) or a Chinese skullcap. Other Jews of this era wore black pillbox-shaped ''kippot''.\n\nOften, the color and fabric of the ''kippah'' can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement, particularly in Israel.

One passage of the older literature is of significance: I Kings 20:31 mentions \u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b8\u05dc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd ''havalim'',  which are placed around the head. This calls to mind pictures of [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] on [[Egypt]]ian monuments, represented wearing a cord around their long, flowing hair, a custom still followed in [[Arabia]].\n\nEvidently the costume of the poorest classes is represented; but as the cord gave no protection against the heat of the sun, there is little probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the simple cloth skullcap, dating back to Egyptian times when those of high society routinely shaved their heads, to prevent lice. Conversely, their skullcaps also served as protection against irritation from their wigs.\n\nThe Israelites might have worn a headdress similar to that worn by the [[Bedouins]], but it is unknown whether a fixed type of headdress was utilized. That the headdress of the Israelites might have been in the fellah style may be inferred from the use of the noun \u05e6\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e3 ''tzanif'' (the verb ''tzanaf'' meaning \"to roll like a ball\", Isaiah 22:18) and by the verb \u05d7\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9 ''habash'' (\"to wind\", comp. Ezekiel 16:10; Jonah 2:6). As to the form of such turbans, nothing is known, and they may have varied according to the different classes of society. This was customary with the Assyrians and Babylonians, for example, whose fashions likely influenced the costume of the Israelites\u2014particularly during and after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]].<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=465&letter=H&search=Head-Dress \"Head-dress\"], ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> In Yemen, the wrap around the cap was called \u05de\u05b7\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8 ''matzar''; the head covering worn by women was a \u05d2\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9 ''[[gargush]]''.<ref>[http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm \"Clothing of the Yemenite Jews\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220174330/http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm |date=2006-02-20 }}, Chayas.com</ref>\n\n== Civil legal issues ==\n\nIn ''[[Goldman v.

One passage of the older literature is of significance: I Kings 20:31 mentions \u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b8\u05dc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd ''havalim'',  which are placed around the head. This calls to mind pictures of [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] on [[Egypt]]ian monuments, represented wearing a cord around their long, flowing hair, a custom still followed in [[Arabia]].\n\nEvidently the costume of the poorest classes is represented; but as the cord gave no protection against the heat of the sun, there is little probability that the custom lasted very long. Much more common was the simple cloth skullcap, dating back to Egyptian times when those of high society routinely shaved their heads, to prevent lice. Conversely, their skullcaps also served as protection against irritation from their wigs.\n\nThe Israelites might have worn a headdress similar to that worn by the [[Bedouins]], but it is unknown whether a fixed type of headdress was utilized. That the headdress of the Israelites might have been in the fellah style may be inferred from the use of the noun \u05e6\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e3 ''tzanif'' (the verb ''tzanaf'' meaning \"to roll like a ball\", Isaiah 22:18) and by the verb \u05d7\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9 ''habash'' (\"to wind\", comp. Ezekiel 16:10; Jonah 2:6). As to the form of such turbans, nothing is known, and they may have varied according to the different classes of society. This was customary with the Assyrians and Babylonians, for example, whose fashions likely influenced the costume of the Israelites\u2014particularly during and after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]].<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=465&letter=H&search=Head-Dress \"Head-dress\"], ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> In Yemen, the wrap around the cap was called \u05de\u05b7\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8 ''matzar''; the head covering worn by women was a \u05d2\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9 ''[[gargush]]''.<ref>[http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm \"Clothing of the Yemenite Jews\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220174330/http://www.chayas.com/garb.htm |date=2006-02-20 }}, Chayas.com</ref>\n\n== Civil legal issues ==\n\nIn ''[[Goldman v.

Whiting was arrested a few weeks later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red [[Ford Sierra]], which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had told her he had a knife in his possession.<ref name=\"first victim\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}\n\nThree months later, Whiting admitted charges of abduction and [[indecent assault]], and was sentenced to four years in prison. The maximum sentence for the crime was [[life imprisonment]]; however, he received a lesser sentence because he had admitted to the crime at an early opportunity, although a [[psychiatrist]] who assessed Whiting after his conviction said that he was likely to re-offend once he was released.<ref name=\"freed to kill\"/>\n\nWhiting was released from prison in November 1997, having served 2 years and 5 months of his 4-year sentence, and was one of the first people in Britain to go on the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offenders' register]]. He had been forced to serve an extra five months in prison before being released on licence as penalty for refusing to undergo a sex offenders rehabilitation course.<ref name=\"refused treatment\"/>\n\nWhiting moved {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=}} away from Crawley to [[Littlehampton]] on the West Sussex coast, upon his release.<ref name=\"co973236\"/>{{Better source|reason=Sensationalist tabloid, more objective article available?|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Sarah Payne's disappearance==\nSarah Payne, who lived in [[Hersham]], [[Surrey]], disappeared on the evening of 1 July 2000 from a cornfield near the home of her paternal grandparents, Terence and Lesley Payne, in [[Kingston Gorse]], [[West Sussex]], England.<ref name=\"sworn in\"/> Payne had been playing with her two elder brothers (aged 13 and 11 at the time) and younger sister (aged 6).<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/> A nationwide search commenced within 48 hours, and Payne's parents made numerous television and newspaper appeals for her safe return. On the evening of 2 July 2000, officers from Sussex Police first visited Whiting making inquiries into Payne's disappearance. A number of other suspects were also questioned and at least one other person was arrested.<ref name=\"nowhere near\"/>\n\nPolice officers and numerous volunteers scoured the area around Littlehampton for clues to Sarah's disappearance, and her family made daily appeals on national television news for help in finding Sarah. On 10 July, police announced that they had received information regarding the sighting of a girl who matched Sarah's description at [[Knutsford Services]] on the [[M6 motorway]] in [[Cheshire]] on the morning after her disappearance. Three days later, Michael and Sara Payne were warned by police to \"prepare for the worst\", explaining that the emphasis of their inquiries had shifted and that there was a possibility that their daughter might not be found safe and well.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nOn 17 July, a body was found in a field near [[Pulborough]], some {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Kingston Gorse where she had disappeared. Within 24 hours, [[forensic]] science tests confirmed that the body was that of Sarah Payne, and [[Sussex Police]] began a murder investigation.<ref name=\"body confirmed\"/>\n\n==Murder investigation==\nWhiting was first questioned about the disappearance of Payne, which had taken place about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from Whiting's home, some 24 hours after she went missing. Whiting was routinely questioned as he had been placed on the [[sex offender registry]]. On the officers' first visit to Whiting's home earlier that day, he was not there. The police returned five hours later and questioned Whiting for over an hour before leaving.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/>\n\nSoon after questioning, Whiting walked to his van, but was stopped by undercover police and arrested.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/> Whiting spent two days in custody, but there was no evidence to press any charges and Whiting was released on bail. Police had found a receipt for fuel from Buck Barn garage on the [[A24 (road)|A24]], not far from [[Coolham]] where one of Payne's shoes was found.<ref name=\"I tell truth\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}<ref name=\"summer evening\"/> This contradicted his alibi of being at a [[funfair]] in [[Hove]] at 5:30&nbsp;pm and then returning to his flat by 9:30&nbsp;pm on the night that Payne had disappeared.<ref name=\"funfair alibi\"/>\n\nOn 20 July, a shoe was recovered from a roadside in the village of Coolham, three miles from Pulborough, and identified as one of those belonging to Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2000, Whiting stole a [[Vauxhall Nova]] and was pursued by police at speeds of up to {{convert|70|mph}} before crashing into a parked vehicle. Whiting was arrested on a charge of [[dangerous driving]]. Whiting was remanded in custody until 27 September 2000, when he admitted taking the car and driving dangerously and was jailed for 22 months.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting began his jail term for the car theft and dangerous driving, detectives carried out forensic tests on his 1988 white [[Fiat Ducato]] van, which he had bought on 23 June 2000. On 6 February 2001, following a police enquiry, Whiting was charged with the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"Rearrest\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nBy 6 February 2001, Sussex Police had enough evidence to press charges against Whiting, who appeared at [[Lewes Crown Court]] that day, charged with abduction and murder. Whiting pleaded not guilty to both charges and was remanded in custody, with his trial due to start on 14 November 2001. He was still serving his sentence for the motoring offences at this stage, but the new charges against him prevented his release from prison during the summer of that year for the motoring offences.<ref name=\"charged with murder\"/>\n\nOn 14 November 2001, at Lewes Crown Court, the jury heard from several witnesses. The key witnesses included Payne's oldest brother who had seen a 'scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth' drive by. However, Lee Payne did not pick out Whiting when he was selected for an identity parade.<ref name=\"smiled\"/> One of Payne's shoes was found by a member of the public in a country lane and forensic tests had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. This was the only item of Payne's clothing to be recovered.<ref name=\"examined shoe\"/> A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting's van. A DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne.<ref name=\"one in a billion\"/>\n\nOn 12 December 2001, after a four-week trial before Mr Justice Curtis and a jury, Whiting was convicted of the abduction and murder of Payne and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. The trial judge said it was a rare case in which a life sentence [[whole life tariff|should mean life]].<ref name=\"guilty\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting was convicted, his previous convictions were revealed; it had previously been withheld from the jury and media amid police fears that any knowledge in court of his previous conviction could jeopardize the trial and in the event of being convicted, Whiting would argue that he had been tried on the evidence of an earlier crime, paving the way for a potentially successful appeal. There were renewed calls for the government to allow controlled public access to the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offender's register]], although the [[Home Office]] commented the day after Whiting's conviction that such a system would be \"unworkable\" and run the risk of driving paedophiles \"underground\", making it more difficult for the police to monitor and locate them, as well as putting them in danger of vigilante attacks.<ref name=\"unworkable\"/>\n\nThis case is also notable for the extensive use of forensic sciences in establishing the prosecution case against Whiting. Twenty forensic experts from a variety of fields were employed during the inquiry, including [[entomology]], palynology/environmental profiling, [[pathology]], geology, [[archaeology]], and oil/lubricant analysis. It has been estimated<ref>{{cite web |last1=Acford |first1=Louise |title=Sarah Payne investigation cost nearly \u00a33m |url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/1859160.sarah-payne-investigation-cost-nearly-3m/ |website=Argus on line newspaper |publisher=Newsquest, a Gannet company |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref> that the investigation involved one thousand personnel and cost more than \u00a32 million.\n\n===Sentencing===\nOn 24 November 2002, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] ordered that Roy Whiting must serve a minimum of 50 years in prison. This made him ineligible for parole until 2051, meaning that he would have to live to be at least 92 before parole could be considered; this was in effect an agreement with the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff.<ref name=\"50 years\"/> Within 48 hours of the ruling being made, the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] had ruled in favour of another convicted murderer ([[Anthony Anderson (murderer)|Anthony Anderson]]) who was challenging the right of politicians to decide how long a murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole.<ref name=\"lords defy blunkett\"/>\n\nIn June 2004, it was confirmed that Whiting would be applying to the [[Court of Appeal]] for a new minimum term to be set.<ref name=\"plea for early\"/> On 9 June 2010, Whiting's appeal resulted in his 50-year jail term being reduced by 10 years by a High Court judge. Whiting's lawyers argued that the 50-year tariff, imposed just before the power of Home Secretaries to determine how long prisoners sentenced to life should serve lapsed, was politically motivated; the decision was also made at a time when the government was under fire from the public and media over a firefighters strike. [[Peregrine Simon|Mr Justice Simon]] said that under 2010 sentencing guidelines, Whiting may have received a [[whole life tariff]], but apparently<!-- unfortunately the BBC article is not fully clear on this --> arrived at the 40-year term by retroactively applying guidelines from the time of the original sentencing. Whiting is now serving a 40-year minimum term, which is set to keep him in prison until at least 2041, when he will be 82. Payne's mother, Sara, was present and said she was \"disappointed\" by the decision and \"life should mean life\".<ref name=\"term reduced\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sarah's Law===\n{{redirect|Sarah's Law|the US proposal|California Proposition 4 (2008)}}\n{{See also|Criminal record#United Kingdom}}\nThe campaign for Sarah's Law  was spearheaded by the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, and began in July 2000 in response to the murder of Sarah Payne. Sarah Payne's parents backed up the campaign as they were sure that a [[child sexual abuse|child sex offender]] had been responsible for their daughter's death. Their belief was proved correct 17 months later when Roy Whiting was found guilty of killing Sarah Payne, and it was revealed that he already had a conviction for abducting and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl.\n\nThe aim of the campaign was for the government to allow controlled access to the [[sex offender registry]], so parents with young children could know if a child sex-offender were living in their area. Sarah Payne's mother has always insisted that such a law would have saved her daughter's life.\n\nA modified scheme where parents can enquire about a named individual was introduced in four pilot areas of England and Wales in September 2008. In August 2010 the [[Home Office]] announced that after proving successful, the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme would be extended to cover the whole of England and Wales by spring 2011.<ref name=\"no vigilante\"/>\n\n===Payne family===\nPayne's mother, [[Sara Payne]], has subsequently written a book, ''[[Sara Payne: A Mother's Story]]'', about her daughter's murder and the aftermath, including her campaign for Sarah's Law. The book was published in 2004.<ref name=\"payne240\"/>\n\nIn July 2001, it was reported that Payne's parents received \u00a311,000 compensation from the [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]], an executive agency of the [[UK Government]]. Sara Payne described the offer as a \"sick joke\" and \"derisory\", even though it was the maximum CICA could offer by law.<ref name=\"sick offer\"/> \n\nSara Payne was made a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in December 2008 for her work behind Sarah's Law.<ref name=\"Sara MBE\"/> In December 2011, she suffered a life-threatening stroke and collapsed while at her home.<ref name=\"collapsing\"/>\n\nIn July 2011 it was revealed that Sara Payne had been among those targeted in the [[News International phone hacking scandal]].<ref name=\"news of the world\"/> Payne refused to believe it, since they had been so helpful in championing Sarah's Law. She even wrote an editorial in the newspaper's final edition. Investigators initially thought she was not hacked because her name did not come up in records. However, personal details relating to her were found that were attributed to another suspected victim. Sara's phone that was hacked was given to her by the News of the World's editor at the time of the murder, [[Rebekah Brooks]].\n\nPayne's father, Michael, suffered from depression following the disappearance of his daughter.<ref name=\"father dead\"/> He separated from his wife of 18 years in August 2003, and subsequently became an alcoholic, leading to a 16-month jail term for attacking his brother with a glass in December 2011, during a drunken incident. On 30 October 2014, he was found dead at his home in [[Maidstone, Kent]]; police reported there were no suspicious circumstances.<ref name=\"father dead\"/>\n\n===Roy Whiting===\nOn 4 August 2002, Whiting was attacked with a razor by another prisoner while fetching hot water at [[Wakefield Prison]]. Convicted killer Rickie Tregaskis (serving life imprisonment with a 25-year recommended minimum for the 1997 murder of a disabled man in [[Cornwall]]) was found guilty of carrying out the slashing which left Whiting with a six-inch scar on his right cheek.<ref name=\"bbcyorkshire\"/> Tregaskis received a six-year sentence (to run concurrently alongside his life sentence) after being found guilty on a wounding charge relating to the attack on Whiting. This will not mean that he will have to serve any extra time in prison if the [[Parole Board]] decides that he can be freed on [[life licence]].{{Citation needed|reason=Previous source was too generic|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn July 2011, Whiting was again attacked in prison, this time stabbed in the eye. No charge was pressed by Whiting and consequently a police investigation into the assault was not undertaken.  Whiting's injuries were not life-threatening.<ref name=\"Gary Vinter\"/>\n\nHe was attacked again on 8 November 2018, when he was stabbed by two other prisoners in his cell at HMP Wakefield. He was taken to hospital for treatment but returned to prison shortly after in a stable condition.<ref>{{Cite web |

Whiting was arrested a few weeks later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red [[Ford Sierra]], which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had told her he had a knife in his possession.<ref name=\"first victim\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}\n\nThree months later, Whiting admitted charges of abduction and [[indecent assault]], and was sentenced to four years in prison. The maximum sentence for the crime was [[life imprisonment]]; however, he received a lesser sentence because he had admitted to the crime at an early opportunity, although a [[psychiatrist]] who assessed Whiting after his conviction said that he was likely to re-offend once he was released.<ref name=\"freed to kill\"/>\n\nWhiting was released from prison in November 1997, having served 2 years and 5 months of his 4-year sentence, and was one of the first people in Britain to go on the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offenders' register]]. He had been forced to serve an extra five months in prison before being released on licence as penalty for refusing to undergo a sex offenders rehabilitation course.<ref name=\"refused treatment\"/>\n\nWhiting moved {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} away from Crawley to [[Littlehampton]] on the West Sussex coast, upon his release.<ref name=\"co973236\"/>{{Better source|reason=Sensationalist tabloid, more objective article available?|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Sarah Payne's disappearance==\nSarah Payne, who lived in [[Hersham]], [[Surrey]], disappeared on the evening of 1 July 2000 from a cornfield near the home of her paternal grandparents, Terence and Lesley Payne, in [[Kingston Gorse]], [[West Sussex]], England.<ref name=\"sworn in\"/> Payne had been playing with her two elder brothers (aged 13 and 11 at the time) and younger sister (aged 6).<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/> A nationwide search commenced within 48 hours, and Payne's parents made numerous television and newspaper appeals for her safe return. On the evening of 2 July 2000, officers from Sussex Police first visited Whiting making inquiries into Payne's disappearance. A number of other suspects were also questioned and at least one other person was arrested.<ref name=\"nowhere near\"/>\n\nPolice officers and numerous volunteers scoured the area around Littlehampton for clues to Sarah's disappearance, and her family made daily appeals on national television news for help in finding Sarah. On 10 July, police announced that they had received information regarding the sighting of a girl who matched Sarah's description at [[Knutsford Services]] on the [[M6 motorway]] in [[Cheshire]] on the morning after her disappearance. Three days later, Michael and Sara Payne were warned by police to \"prepare for the worst\", explaining that the emphasis of their inquiries had shifted and that there was a possibility that their daughter might not be found safe and well.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nOn 17 July, a body was found in a field near [[Pulborough]], some {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Kingston Gorse where she had disappeared. Within 24 hours, [[forensic]] science tests confirmed that the body was that of Sarah Payne, and [[Sussex Police]] began a murder investigation.<ref name=\"body confirmed\"/>\n\n==Murder investigation==\nWhiting was first questioned about the disappearance of Payne, which had taken place about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from Whiting's home, some 24 hours after she went missing. Whiting was routinely questioned as he had been placed on the [[sex offender registry]]. On the officers' first visit to Whiting's home earlier that day, he was not there. The police returned five hours later and questioned Whiting for over an hour before leaving.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/>\n\nSoon after questioning, Whiting walked to his van, but was stopped by undercover police and arrested.<ref name=\"guardian secret\"/> Whiting spent two days in custody, but there was no evidence to press any charges and Whiting was released on bail. Police had found a receipt for fuel from Buck Barn garage on the [[A24 (road)|A24]], not far from [[Coolham]] where one of Payne's shoes was found.<ref name=\"I tell truth\"/>{{Better source|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=July 2019}}<ref name=\"summer evening\"/> This contradicted his alibi of being at a [[funfair]] in [[Hove]] at 5:30&nbsp;pm and then returning to his flat by 9:30&nbsp;pm on the night that Payne had disappeared.<ref name=\"funfair alibi\"/>\n\nOn 20 July, a shoe was recovered from a roadside in the village of Coolham, three miles from Pulborough, and identified as one of those belonging to Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"timeline tragedy\"/>\n\nOn 23 July 2000, Whiting stole a [[Vauxhall Nova]] and was pursued by police at speeds of up to {{convert|70|mph}} before crashing into a parked vehicle. Whiting was arrested on a charge of [[dangerous driving]]. Whiting was remanded in custody until 27 September 2000, when he admitted taking the car and driving dangerously and was jailed for 22 months.<ref name=\"guardian timeline\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting began his jail term for the car theft and dangerous driving, detectives carried out forensic tests on his 1988 white [[Fiat Ducato]] van, which he had bought on 23 June 2000. On 6 February 2001, following a police enquiry, Whiting was charged with the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne.<ref name=\"Rearrest\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nBy 6 February 2001, Sussex Police had enough evidence to press charges against Whiting, who appeared at [[Lewes Crown Court]] that day, charged with abduction and murder. Whiting pleaded not guilty to both charges and was remanded in custody, with his trial due to start on 14 November 2001. He was still serving his sentence for the motoring offences at this stage, but the new charges against him prevented his release from prison during the summer of that year for the motoring offences.<ref name=\"charged with murder\"/>\n\nOn 14 November 2001, at Lewes Crown Court, the jury heard from several witnesses. The key witnesses included Payne's oldest brother who had seen a 'scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth' drive by. However, Lee Payne did not pick out Whiting when he was selected for an identity parade.<ref name=\"smiled\"/> One of Payne's shoes was found by a member of the public in a country lane and forensic tests had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. This was the only item of Payne's clothing to be recovered.<ref name=\"examined shoe\"/> A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting's van. A DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne.<ref name=\"one in a billion\"/>\n\nOn 12 December 2001, after a four-week trial before Mr Justice Curtis and a jury, Whiting was convicted of the abduction and murder of Payne and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. The trial judge said it was a rare case in which a life sentence [[whole life tariff|should mean life]].<ref name=\"guilty\"/>\n\nAfter Whiting was convicted, his previous convictions were revealed; it had previously been withheld from the jury and media amid police fears that any knowledge in court of his previous conviction could jeopardize the trial and in the event of being convicted, Whiting would argue that he had been tried on the evidence of an earlier crime, paving the way for a potentially successful appeal. There were renewed calls for the government to allow controlled public access to the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register|sex offender's register]], although the [[Home Office]] commented the day after Whiting's conviction that such a system would be \"unworkable\" and run the risk of driving paedophiles \"underground\", making it more difficult for the police to monitor and locate them, as well as putting them in danger of vigilante attacks.<ref name=\"unworkable\"/>\n\nThis case is also notable for the extensive use of forensic sciences in establishing the prosecution case against Whiting. Twenty forensic experts from a variety of fields were employed during the inquiry, including [[entomology]], palynology/environmental profiling, [[pathology]], geology, [[archaeology]], and oil/lubricant analysis. It has been estimated<ref>{{cite web |last1=Acford |first1=Louise |title=Sarah Payne investigation cost nearly \u00a33m |url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/1859160.sarah-payne-investigation-cost-nearly-3m/ |website=Argus on line newspaper |publisher=Newsquest, a Gannet company |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref> that the investigation involved one thousand personnel and cost more than \u00a32 million.\n\n===Sentencing===\nOn 24 November 2002, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] ordered that Roy Whiting must serve a minimum of 50 years in prison. This made him ineligible for parole until 2051, meaning that he would have to live to be at least 92 before parole could be considered; this was in effect an agreement with the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff.<ref name=\"50 years\"/> Within 48 hours of the ruling being made, the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] had ruled in favour of another convicted murderer ([[Anthony Anderson (murderer)|Anthony Anderson]]) who was challenging the right of politicians to decide how long a murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole.<ref name=\"lords defy blunkett\"/>\n\nIn June 2004, it was confirmed that Whiting would be applying to the [[Court of Appeal]] for a new minimum term to be set.<ref name=\"plea for early\"/> On 9 June 2010, Whiting's appeal resulted in his 50-year jail term being reduced by 10 years by a High Court judge. Whiting's lawyers argued that the 50-year tariff, imposed just before the power of Home Secretaries to determine how long prisoners sentenced to life should serve lapsed, was politically motivated; the decision was also made at a time when the government was under fire from the public and media over a firefighters strike. [[Peregrine Simon|Mr Justice Simon]] said that under 2010 sentencing guidelines, Whiting may have received a [[whole life tariff]], but apparently<!-- unfortunately the BBC article is not fully clear on this --> arrived at the 40-year term by retroactively applying guidelines from the time of the original sentencing. Whiting is now serving a 40-year minimum term, which is set to keep him in prison until at least 2041, when he will be 82. Payne's mother, Sara, was present and said she was \"disappointed\" by the decision and \"life should mean life\".<ref name=\"term reduced\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Sarah's Law===\n{{redirect|Sarah's Law|the US proposal|California Proposition 4 (2008)}}\n{{See also|Criminal record#United Kingdom}}\nThe campaign for Sarah's Law  was spearheaded by the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, and began in July 2000 in response to the murder of Sarah Payne. Sarah Payne's parents backed up the campaign as they were sure that a [[child sexual abuse|child sex offender]] had been responsible for their daughter's death. Their belief was proved correct 17 months later when Roy Whiting was found guilty of killing Sarah Payne, and it was revealed that he already had a conviction for abducting and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl.\n\nThe aim of the campaign was for the government to allow controlled access to the [[sex offender registry]], so parents with young children could know if a child sex-offender were living in their area. Sarah Payne's mother has always insisted that such a law would have saved her daughter's life.\n\nA modified scheme where parents can enquire about a named individual was introduced in four pilot areas of England and Wales in September 2008. In August 2010 the [[Home Office]] announced that after proving successful, the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme would be extended to cover the whole of England and Wales by spring 2011.<ref name=\"no vigilante\"/>\n\n===Payne family===\nPayne's mother, [[Sara Payne]], has subsequently written a book, ''[[Sara Payne: A Mother's Story]]'', about her daughter's murder and the aftermath, including her campaign for Sarah's Law. The book was published in 2004.<ref name=\"payne240\"/>\n\nIn July 2001, it was reported that Payne's parents received \u00a311,000 compensation from the [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]], an executive agency of the [[UK Government]]. Sara Payne described the offer as a \"sick joke\" and \"derisory\", even though it was the maximum CICA could offer by law.<ref name=\"sick offer\"/> \n\nSara Payne was made a Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in December 2008 for her work behind Sarah's Law.<ref name=\"Sara MBE\"/> In December 2011, she suffered a life-threatening stroke and collapsed while at her home.<ref name=\"collapsing\"/>\n\nIn July 2011 it was revealed that Sara Payne had been among those targeted in the [[News International phone hacking scandal]].<ref name=\"news of the world\"/> Payne refused to believe it, since they had been so helpful in championing Sarah's Law. She even wrote an editorial in the newspaper's final edition. Investigators initially thought she was not hacked because her name did not come up in records. However, personal details relating to her were found that were attributed to another suspected victim. Sara's phone that was hacked was given to her by the News of the World's editor at the time of the murder, [[Rebekah Brooks]].\n\nPayne's father, Michael, suffered from depression following the disappearance of his daughter.<ref name=\"father dead\"/> He separated from his wife of 18 years in August 2003, and subsequently became an alcoholic, leading to a 16-month jail term for attacking his brother with a glass in December 2011, during a drunken incident. On 30 October 2014, he was found dead at his home in [[Maidstone, Kent]]; police reported there were no suspicious circumstances.<ref name=\"father dead\"/>\n\n===Roy Whiting===\nOn 4 August 2002, Whiting was attacked with a razor by another prisoner while fetching hot water at [[Wakefield Prison]]. Convicted killer Rickie Tregaskis (serving life imprisonment with a 25-year recommended minimum for the 1997 murder of a disabled man in [[Cornwall]]) was found guilty of carrying out the slashing which left Whiting with a six-inch scar on his right cheek.<ref name=\"bbcyorkshire\"/> Tregaskis received a six-year sentence (to run concurrently alongside his life sentence) after being found guilty on a wounding charge relating to the attack on Whiting. This will not mean that he will have to serve any extra time in prison if the [[Parole Board]] decides that he can be freed on [[life licence]].{{Citation needed|reason=Previous source was too generic|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn July 2011, Whiting was again attacked in prison, this time stabbed in the eye. No charge was pressed by Whiting and consequently a police investigation into the assault was not undertaken.  Whiting's injuries were not life-threatening.<ref name=\"Gary Vinter\"/>\n\nHe was attacked again on 8 November 2018, when he was stabbed by two other prisoners in his cell at HMP Wakefield. He was taken to hospital for treatment but returned to prison shortly after in a stable condition.<ref>{{Cite web |

The film is based on the true story of [[Michael David Weiss|Michael David \"Mike\" Weiss]] and Paul Danziger. It was chosen as one of the spotlight films for the 2011 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], premiering on April 21, 2011 in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/puncture-film36410.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408145328/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/puncture-film36410.html |archivedate=2011-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nMike Weiss, a young Houston lawyer and drug addict, and Paul Danziger, his longtime friend and straitlaced law partner, are the personal injury lawyers behind the law firm Danziger & Weiss. They decide to take on a case involving Vicky Rogers, a local ER nurse, who was [[Needlestick injury|pricked by a contaminated needle]] on the job and contracted AIDS. Vicky shows Mike and Paul a safety needle, invented by her family friend, Jeffrey Dancort, which defends against accidental [[Needlestick injury|needlesticks]] by only being used once, and she urges them to help bring the product to hospitals. Vicky later dies from her illness. Mike digs deeper into the case, and discovers no one is willing to buy the needle because of a healthcare/pharmaceutical conspiracy and bribery racket. With the threat of exposure, heavyweight attorneys move in on the defense led by attorney Nathaniel Price. Out of their league and out of money, the mounting pressure of the case pushes the two underdog lawyers and their business to the breaking point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killerfilm.com/articles/read/evans-gets-a-puncture-27973 |title=Evans gets a Puncture |work=KillerFilm.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> \n\nIn the meantime, Mike is struggling with his heavy drug usage and his loneliness. He seeks sex therapy as a source of comfort and is consistently in the company of prostitutes. His personal struggles impede on his professional ambitions, as he misses many of the meetings and investment events, driving a wedge between him and Paul.\n\nMike, Paul, and Dancort gain the support of Senator O'Reilly, not before she gives Mike an ultimatum: get clean. Mike heavy withdrawal leaves him hospitalized, only adding to the financial burdens of the firm. The momentum of the case seems to come to a standstill: Senator O'Reilly pulls out after United Medical Health Supplies lobbies for her re-election campaign and Paul, with a new baby at home, is not interested in pursuing the case over his family.\n\nThey meet with Nathaniel Price, and he offers a settlement, the tipping point for the conflict between Mike and Paul. Their conflict comes to a head as Mike argues to take the case to trial and seek justice, while Paul protests there is no feasible way they can continue all the way financially. Mike meets a former employee of Thompson Needle Manufacturers and a friend of Vicky's, who implores him to continue the case on behalf of the lives affected by used needles, which spread AIDS and Hepatitis worldwide. Mike meets with Nathaniel Price and pledges he will personally find new clients and hospital employees affected by these unsafe needles across the country. However, the next day, Paul finds Mike dead from an overdose.\n\nAt the settlement conference, Danziger walks in with famous personal injury attorney [[Mark Lanier]], declining the settlement and proclaiming that they will see them in court. The movie postscript tells the audience that in 2004, Attorney Lanier settled a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest medical supply manufacturer for over $150 million. <ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/03/business/03buyer.html?scp=16&sq=Retractable%20Technologies%20Inc&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Syringe Manufacturer Settles Claim of Market Manipulation | date=July 3, 2004|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> \"As a result, thousands of hospitals throughout the United States now use safety needles.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Atty.

The film is based on the true story of [[Michael David Weiss|Michael David \"Mike\" Weiss]] and Paul Danziger. It was chosen as one of the spotlight films for the 2011 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], premiering on April 21, 2011 in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/puncture-film36410.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408145328/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/puncture-film36410.html |archivedate=2011-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nMike Weiss, a young Houston lawyer and drug addict, and Paul Danziger, his longtime friend and straitlaced law partner, are the personal injury lawyers behind the law firm Danziger & Weiss. They decide to take on a case involving Vicky Rogers, a local ER nurse, who was [[Needlestick injury|pricked by a contaminated needle]] on the job and contracted AIDS. Vicky shows Mike and Paul a safety needle, invented by her family friend, Jeffrey Dancort, which defends against accidental [[Needlestick injury|needlesticks]] by only being used once, and she urges them to help bring the product to hospitals. Vicky later dies from her illness. Mike digs deeper into the case, and discovers no one is willing to buy the needle because of a healthcare/pharmaceutical conspiracy and bribery racket. With the threat of exposure, heavyweight attorneys move in on the defense led by attorney Nathaniel Price. Out of their league and out of money, the mounting pressure of the case pushes the two underdog lawyers and their business to the breaking point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killerfilm.com/articles/read/evans-gets-a-puncture-27973 |title=Evans gets a Puncture |work=KillerFilm.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> \n\nIn the meantime, Mike is struggling with his heavy drug usage and his loneliness. He seeks sex therapy as a source of comfort and is consistently in the company of prostitutes. His personal struggles impede on his professional ambitions, as he misses many of the meetings and investment events, driving a wedge between him and Paul.\n\nMike, Paul, and Dancort gain the support of Senator O'Reilly, not before she gives Mike an ultimatum: get clean. Mike heavy withdrawal leaves him hospitalized, only adding to the financial burdens of the firm. The momentum of the case seems to come to a standstill: Senator O'Reilly pulls out after United Medical Health Supplies lobbies for her re-election campaign and Paul, with a new baby at home, is not interested in pursuing the case over his family.\n\nThey meet with Nathaniel Price, and he offers a settlement, the tipping point for the conflict between Mike and Paul. Their conflict comes to a head as Mike argues to take the case to trial and seek justice, while Paul protests there is no feasible way they can continue all the way financially. Mike meets a former employee of Thompson Needle Manufacturers and a friend of Vicky's, who implores him to continue the case on behalf of the lives affected by used needles, which spread AIDS and Hepatitis worldwide. Mike meets with Nathaniel Price and pledges he will personally find new clients and hospital employees affected by these unsafe needles across the country. However, the next day, Paul finds Mike dead from an overdose.\n\nAt the settlement conference, Danziger walks in with famous personal injury attorney [[Mark Lanier]], declining the settlement and proclaiming that they will see them in court. The movie postscript tells the audience that in 2004, Attorney Lanier settled a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest medical supply manufacturer for over $150 million. <ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/03/business/03buyer.html?scp=16&sq=Retractable%20Technologies%20Inc&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Syringe Manufacturer Settles Claim of Market Manipulation | date=July 3, 2004|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> \"As a result, thousands of hospitals throughout the United States now use safety needles.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Atty.

{"title_page": "Glossary of dance moves", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia glossary}}\n== A-K ==\n\n=== Ball change ===\nShifting your weight from the ball of your foot to the other and back. We mostly use this in jazz and [[jive (dance)|jive]].\n\n=== Basic figure ===\n''Same as [[#Basic movement|Basic movement]]''\n\n=== Basic movement ===\n[[Basic movement (dance)|Basic movement]] is the very basic step that defines the character of a dance. Often it is called just thus: \"basic movement\" or \"basic step\". For some dances it is sufficient to know the basic step performed in different [[#Handhold|handhold]]s and [[#Dance position|dance positions]] to enjoy it socially.\n\n=== Basic step ===\n''Same as [[#Basic movement|Basic movement]].''\n\n=== Box step ===\n[[Box step]] is a dance figure named so because the steps rest in the four corners of a square. It is used, e.g., in [[Glossary of partner dance terms#American Style|American Style]] ballroom dances: [[Rhumba|Rumba]] bronze-level [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]]. The leader begins with the left foot and proceeds as follows.\n:''First half-box'': Forward-side-together\n:''Second half-box'': Backwards-side-together\nEvery step is with [[full weight transfer]]. during the second and fourth step it is advised the foot to travel along two sides of the box, rather than along its diagonal.\n\nRhythm varies, e.g., it is \"1-2-3,4-5-6\" in Waltz and \"slow quick quick, slow quick quick\" in Rumba.\n\n=== Cha\u00een\u00e9s / chain\u00e9 turns / chaines turns ===\nSee [[Glossary of ballet terms#Cha\u00een\u00e9s]].\n\nFrench for \"chain\", a series of quick turns staring from second position going to first position alternating on either flat feet or on [[Relev\u00e9 (dance)|relev\u00e9]] with progression along a straight line or circle.\n\n=== Chass\u00e9 ===\n[[Chass\u00e9]] (French, \"to chase\") is a dance step with a triple step pattern used in many forms of dance. It is a gliding, flowing step with the feet essentially following a step together step pattern. Timing and length of steps vary from dance to dance.\n\n=== Closed change ===\n[[Closed and Open Changes|Closed change]] is a basic step in the [[waltz]]. The man steps forward on either foot whilst the lady steps backward on the opposing foot (e.g.: the man steps forward on his right foot whilst the lady steps back on her left). They will then step to the side on the other foot, and conclude the figure by closing the first foot beside the second (hence the name \"closed\" of the step). Each step takes up a full beat of the music.\n\n=== Cross-body lead ===\nCross-body lead is a common and useful move in [[Latin dance]]s such as [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]], [[Rhumba|rumba]] and [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]].  Basically, the man on counts 2 and 3 of his basic step (assuming dancing on 1) does a quarter-left turn (90\u00b0 counterclockwise) while still holding on to the woman.  On counts 4 and 5, he leads the woman forward across him, i.e., firmly leads her with his right hand on her back, so that she travels across and turns around and faces the opposite direction she was facing.  At the same time, the man does another quarter-left turn as necessary in order to follow the woman and face her.  At the end of the move, the dancers have their positions exchanged.\n\nThe cross-body lead can be done with single-hand or double hand hold, with or without a woman's underarm turn, or leading the woman to do a [[Glossary of dance moves#Free spin|free spin]].\n\n=== Dos-\u00e0-dos / dosado ===\n\n[[Dosado]] is a circular movement where two people, who are initially facing each other, walk around each other without or almost without turning, i.e., facing in the same direction (same wall) all the time.\n\n=== Enchufla ===\nThis is a dance movement common in [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], where the two dance partners facing each other change positions. The dance partners keep contact with one or two hands while stepping to  rotate concentrically over 180 degrees around the same point in opposite directions.\n\n=== Feather step ===\nThe [[Feather (step)|feather]] is a basic figure in [[Ballroom dance#International Style|International Style]] [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]], in which the man makes three or four steps  basically forward, with the third one (right foot) done outside the lady.\n\n=== Floss ===\n{{main|Floss (dance)}}\n\n=== Free spin ===\nIn [[lead and follow]] dance, a [[dance turn]] performed without partner contact.\n\n=== Gancho ===\n\"[[Gancho (dance move)|Gancho]]\" means \"hook\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and describes certain \"hooking actions\" in some dances of Latin American heritage, in [[Argentine tango]] (leg action) and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] (arm action and foot action) in particular.\n\n=== Grapevine ===\nStep on leg, working leg goes behind, stepping to the side then join.\n\n=== Heel turn ===\nA ballroom dance move, which is the turn on the heel of the [[support foot]] while the other foot is held close and parallel to the support one. At the end of the turn the weight is transferred from one foot to another.<ref name=am/>\n\n=== Heel pull ===\nA variant of the [[#Heel turn]], in which the feet are kept apart.<ref name=am/>\n\n=== Inside partner step ===\nA step taken forward into the space occupied by the partner, while the partner steps backwards. During this step feet [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Track of foot|tracks]] of both partners overlap. See also [[#Outside partner step]].\n\n=== Inside turn ===\nThe term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes a turn where the arm of the partner doing the turn begins by moving towards the \"inside\" of the couple (the line running from the center of one partner to the center of the other). The meaning is intuitively clear, but it may be performed in numerous ways and in different handholds, so that even accomplished dancers are confused. In dances such as swing and salsa, inside and outside turns most commonly refer to underarm turns done by the follower.  Since in these dances the follower's right arm is normally used to lead a turn (most commonly by the leader's left arm, but sometimes by the leader's right arm when a cross-hand or \"handshake\" position is used), an inside turn is normally a left (counter-clockwise) turn, while an outside turn is a right (clockwise) turn.  However, if the follower's left arm is used to initiate the turn, the intended direction of turning may be opposite. (Alternatively, the non-ambiguous terms \"left turn\" and \"right turn\" may be used.)\n\nSee [[Direction of movement (dance)|Direction of movement]] for more detail.\n\n== L-Z ==\n\n=== Lock step ===\nA [[Lock step (dance)|Lock step]] is an alternative variation of a [[chass\u00e9]] action which occurs when the moving foot swings to a stop across the track of the standing foot rather than closing next to it.  In the Latin dances the combination of the crossed position and the turnout of the feet means that the rear toe will be pointed at the heel of the other foot, while in the Standard dances the lack of turnout means the feet will be parallel.  In [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Standard|Standard]] the basic locking action is usually preceded and followed by a left [[side lead]].  The [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Latin|Latin]] lock step is often featured when [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha]] is danced in [[open position]] with a one-hand hold.\n\n=== Moonwalk ===\nThe [[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]] is a dance technique that presents the illusion of the dancer being pulled backwards while attempting to walk forward.\n\n=== Natural turn ===\n[[Natural and reverse turns|Natural turns]] and some other figures are those in which the dance couple rotates to the right (clockwise).\n\n=== Open turn ===\nA ballroom dance figure in which during the last step the moving foot passes the [[support foot]], rather than closes to it.<ref name=am>[[Alex Moore (dancer)|Moore, Alex]] (2002/1972). ''Ballroom Dancing'', section \"Definition of technical terms\". Taylor & Francis. 10th edition. {{ISBN|9780878301539}}.</ref>\n\n=== Outside partner step ===\nA step taken with the partner beside the [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Moving foot|moving foot]] (e.g., to the left of the left moving foot).  During this step [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Track of foot|feet tracks]] of both partners do not overlap.  See also [[#Inside partner step]].\n\n=== Outside turn ===\n''Cf. [[#Inside turn|Inside turn]].''\n\nThe term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes the lead/follow connection directed \"outside\" of the center of the spinning individual. Inside and outside terminology can not be determined by relativity to partnership as such position alternates every 180 degrees of rotation. Connection points and application of active side are consistent only with regard to the axis of rotation and direction of spin.\n\nSee [[Direction of movement (dance)|Direction of movement]] for more detail.\n\n=== Pirouette ===\nThis term usually refers to turning or spinning on one foot while touching the standing leg with the opposite leg in a bent position.\n\n=== Reverse turn ===\n[[Natural and reverse turns|Reverse turns]] and some other figures are those in which the dance couple rotates to the left (counterclockwise).\n\n=== Rond ===\n''See [[Ballet glossary#Rond de jambe]]''.\nA toe of the straight leg draws a semicircle on the floor. In ballroom dances the direction is usually from the front to back.\n\n=== Telemark ===\n{{main|Telemark (waltz)}}\n\n=== Thunder clap ===\nThe thunder clap is a form of [[dance]] that incorporates [[clapping]] in the air with a sliding motion.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} To perform this dance one must raise one hand and then with the second hand meet the first one half way making a clapping sound; that hand must then fully extend. This motion is repeated to the beat of the music.\n\n=== Time step ===\n*In [[tap dancing]], the time step is a recognizable rhythmic tap combination. The term comes from the time of great tap dancers that used their distinctive time step to tell the band the desired tempo. Common tap time steps are classified as single, double and triple. The basic rhythm and tempo remain the same but the number of sounds that happen on the second and sixth count of an eight-count phrase denotes single (often a single step) double (usually a flap or slap-tap) or triple (commonly shuffle-step). While these are the universal time steps, dancers often choose to create their own time steps, following the pattern two bars repeated three times with a two bar [[break (music)|break]].\n* [[Time Steps (Cha-cha-cha)|Time steps]] is a figure in [[Ballroom dance#International Style|International Style]] cha-cha-cha.\n* In various rhythmic ballroom/social dances, ''time step'' sometimes refers to steps in place that mark the characteristic rhythm of the dance, \"2-3-cha-cha-cha\" for Cha-cha-cha, \"1,2,3,4\" for [[pasodoble]], \"1,2,3,...5,6,7,...\" for \"[[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] on one\", etc..\n\n=== Walk ===\nThe [[Promenade (dance move)|walk]] is probably the most basic dance move. It exists in almost every dance. Walks approximately correspond normal walking steps, taking into the account the basic technique of the dance in question. (For example, in [[Latin dance]] walks the toe hits the floor first, rather than the heel.)\n\nIn dance descriptions the term ''walk'' is usually applied when two or more steps are taken in the same direction. A single step, e.g., forward, is called just thus: \"step forward\".\n\nWalks can be done in various dance positions: in [[closed position]], [[Ballroom glossary#Promenade position|promenade position]], [[shadow position]], [[sweetheart position]], etc.\n\nCurved walks are done along a curve, rather than along a straight line.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Dance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glossary Of Dance Moves}}\n[[Category:Dance moves| ]]\n[[Category:Glossaries of dance|Dance moves]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia glossary}}\n== A-K ==\n\n=== Ball change ===\nShifting your weight from the ball of your foot to the other and back. We mostly use this in jazz and [[jive (dance)|jive]].\n\n=== Basic figure ===\n''Same as [[#Basic movement|Basic movement]]''\n\n=== Basic movement ===\n[[Basic movement (dance)|Basic movement]] is the very basic step that defines the character of a dance. Often it is called just thus: \"basic movement\" or \"basic step\". For some dances it is sufficient to know the basic step performed in different [[#Handhold|handhold]]s and [[#Dance position|dance positions]] to enjoy it socially.\n\n=== Basic step ===\n''Same as [[#Basic movement|Basic movement]].''\n\n=== Box step ===\n[[Box step]] is a dance figure named so because the steps rest in the four corners of a square. It is used, e.g., in [[Glossary of partner dance terms#American Style|American Style]] ballroom dances: [[Rhumba|Rumba]] bronze-level [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]]. The leader begins with the left foot and proceeds as follows.\n:''First half-box'': Forward-side-together\n:''Second half-box'': Backwards-side-together\nEvery step is with [[full weight transfer]]. during the second and fourth step it is advised the foot to travel along two sides of the box, rather than along its diagonal.\n\nRhythm varies. E.g., it is \"1-2-3,4-5-6\" in Waltz and \"Sqq, Sqq\" in Rumba.\n\n=== Cha\u00een\u00e9s / Chain\u00e9 turns / Chaines turns ===\nSee [[Glossary of ballet terms#Cha\u00een\u00e9s]].\n\nFrench for \"chain\", a series of quick turns staring from second position going to first position alternating on either flat feet or on [[Relev\u00e9 (dance)|relev\u00e9]] with progression along a straight line or circle.\n\n=== Chass\u00e9 ===\n[[Chass\u00e9]] (French, \"to chase\") is a dance step with a triple step pattern used in many forms of dance. It is a gliding, flowing step with the feet essentially following a step together step pattern. Timing and length of steps vary from dance to dance.\n\n=== Closed change ===\n[[Closed and Open Changes|Closed change]] is a basic step in the [[waltz]]. The man steps forward on either foot whilst the lady steps backward on the opposing foot (e.g.: the man steps forward on his right foot whilst the lady steps back on her left). They will then step to the side on the other foot, and conclude the figure by closing the first foot beside the second (hence the name \"closed\" of the step). Each step takes up a full beat of the music.\n\n=== Cross-body lead ===\nCross-body lead is a common and useful move in [[Latin dance]]s such as [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]], [[Rhumba|rumba]] and [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]].  Basically, the man on counts 2 and 3 of his basic step (assuming dancing on 1) does a quarter-left turn (90\u00b0 counterclockwise) while still holding on to the woman.  On counts 4 and 5, he leads the woman forward across him, i.e., firmly leads her with his right hand on her back, so that she travels across and turns around and faces the opposite direction she was facing.  At the same time, the man does another quarter-left turn as necessary in order to follow the woman and face her.  At the end of the move, the dancers have their positions exchanged.\n\nThe cross-body lead can be done with single-hand or double hand hold, with or without a woman's underarm turn, or leading the woman to do a [[Glossary of dance moves#Free spin|free spin]].\n\n=== Dos-\u00e0-dos, Dosado ===\n\n[[Dosado]] is a circular movement where two people, who are initially facing each other, walk around each other without or almost without turning, i.e., facing in the same direction (same wall) all the time.\n\n=== Enchufla ===\nThis is a dance movement common in [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], where the two dance partners facing each other change positions. The dance partners keep contact with one or two hands while stepping to  rotate concentrically over 180 degrees around the same point in opposite directions.\n\n=== Feather step ===\nThe [[Feather (step)|feather]] is a basic figure in [[Ballroom dance#International Style|International Style]] [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]], in which the man makes three or four steps  basically forward, with the third one (right foot) done outside the lady.\n\n=== Floss ===\n{{main|Floss (dance)}}\n\n=== Free spin ===\nIn [[lead and follow]] dance, a [[dance turn]] performed without partner contact.\n\n=== Gancho ===\n\"[[Gancho (dance move)|Gancho]]\" means \"hook\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and describes certain \"hooking actions\" in some dances of Latin American heritage, in [[Argentine tango]] (leg action) and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] (arm action and foot action) in particular.\n\n=== Grapevine ===\nStep on leg, working leg goes behind, stepping to the side then join.\n\n=== Heel turn ===\nA ballroom dance move, which is the turn on the heel of the [[support foot]] while the other foot is held close and parallel to the support one. At the end of the turn the weight is transferred from one foot to another.<ref name=am/>\n\n=== Heel pull ===\nA variant of the [[#Heel turn]], in which the feet are kept apart.<ref name=am/>\n\n=== Inside partner step ===\nA step taken forward into the space occupied by the partner, while the partner steps backwards. During this step feet [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Track of foot|tracks]] of both partners overlap. See also [[#Outside partner step]].\n\n=== Inside turn ===\nThe term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes a turn where the arm of the partner doing the turn begins by moving towards the \"inside\" of the couple (the line running from the center of one partner to the center of the other). The meaning is intuitively clear, but it may be performed in numerous ways and in different handholds, so that even accomplished dancers are confused. In dances such as swing and salsa, inside and outside turns most commonly refer to underarm turns done by the follower.  Since in these dances the follower's right arm is normally used to lead a turn (most commonly by the leader's left arm, but sometimes by the leader's right arm when a cross-hand or \"handshake\" position is used), an inside turn is normally a left (counter-clockwise) turn, while an outside turn is a right (clockwise) turn.  However, if the follower's left arm is used to initiate the turn, the intended direction of turning may be opposite. (Alternatively, the non-ambiguous terms \"left turn\" and \"right turn\" may be used.)\n\nSee [[Direction of movement (dance)|Direction of movement]] for more detail.\n\n== L-Z ==\n\n=== Lock step ===\nA [[Lock step (dance)|Lock step]] is an alternative variation of a [[chass\u00e9]] action which occurs when the moving foot swings to a stop across the track of the standing foot rather than closing next to it.  In the Latin dances the combination of the crossed position and the turnout of the feet means that the rear toe will be pointed at the heel of the other foot, while in the Standard dances the lack of turnout means the feet will be parallel.  In [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Standard|Standard]] the basic locking action is usually preceded and followed by a left [[side lead]].  The [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Latin|Latin]] lock step is often featured when [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha]] is danced in [[open position]] with a one-hand hold.\n\n=== Moonwalk ===\nThe [[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]] is a dance technique that presents the illusion of the dancer being pulled backwards while attempting to walk forward.\n\n=== Natural turn ===\n[[Natural and reverse turns|Natural turns]] and some other figures are those in which the dance couple rotates to the right (clockwise).\n\n=== Open turn ===\nA ballroom dance figure in which during the last step the moving foot passes the [[support foot]], rather than closes to it.<ref name=am>[[Alex Moore (dancer)|Moore, Alex]] (2002/1972). ''Ballroom Dancing'', section \"Definition of technical terms\". Taylor & Francis. 10th edition. {{ISBN|9780878301539}}.</ref>\n\n=== Outside partner step ===\nA step taken with the partner beside the [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Moving foot|moving foot]] (e.g., to the left of the left moving foot).  During this step [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Track of foot|feet tracks]] of both partners do not overlap.  See also [[#Inside partner step]].\n\n=== Outside turn ===\n''Cf. [[#Inside turn|Inside turn]].''\n\nThe term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes the lead/follow connection directed \"outside\" of the center of the spinning individual. Inside and outside terminology can not be determined by relativity to partnership as such position alternates every 180 degrees of rotation. Connection points and application of active side are consistent only with regard to the axis of rotation and direction of spin.\n\nSee [[Direction of movement (dance)|Direction of movement]] for more detail.\n\n=== Pirouette ===\nThis term usually refers to turning or spinning on one foot while touching the standing leg with the opposite leg in a bent position.\n\n=== Reverse turn ===\n[[Natural and reverse turns|Reverse turns]] and some other figures are those in which the dance couple rotates to the left (counterclockwise).\n\n=== Rond ===\n''See [[Ballet glossary#Rond de jambe]]''.\nA toe of the straight leg draws a semicircle on the floor. In ballroom dances the direction is usually from the front to back.\n\n=== Telemark ===\n{{main|Telemark (waltz)}}\n\n===Thunder clap===\nThe thunder clap is a form of [[dance]] that incorporates [[clapping]] in the air with a sliding motion.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} To perform this dance one must raise one hand and then with the second hand meet the first one half way making a clapping sound; that hand must then fully extend. This motion is repeated to the beat of the music.\n\n=== Time step ===\n*In [[tap dancing]], the time step is a recognizable rhythmic tap combination. The term comes from the time of great tap dancers that used their distinctive time step to tell the band the desired tempo. Common tap time steps are classified as single, double and triple. The basic rhythm and tempo remain the same but the number of sounds that happen on the second and sixth count of an eight-count phrase denotes single (often a single step) double (usually a flap or slap-tap) or triple (commonly shuffle-step). While these are the universal time steps, dancers often choose to create their own time steps, following the pattern two bars repeated three times with a two bar [[break (music)|break]].\n* [[Time Steps (Cha-cha-cha)|Time steps]] is a figure in [[#International Style|International Style]] cha-cha-cha.\n* In various rhythmic ballroom/social dances, ''time step'' sometimes refers to steps in place that mark the characteristic rhythm of the dance, \"2-3-cha-cha-cha\" for Cha-cha-cha, \"1,2,3,4\" for [[pasodoble]], \"1,2,3,...5,6,7,...\" for \"[[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] on one\", etc..\n\n=== Walk ===\nThe [[Promenade (dance move)|walk]] is probably the most basic dance move. It exists in almost every dance. Walks approximately correspond normal walking steps, taking into the account the basic technique of the dance in question. (For example, in [[Latin dance]] walks the toe hits the floor first, rather than the heel.)\n\nIn dance descriptions the term ''walk'' is usually applied when two or more steps are taken in the same direction. A single step, e.g., forward, is called just thus: \"step forward\".\n\nWalks can be done in various dance positions: in [[closed position]], [[Ballroom glossary#Promenade position|promenade position]], [[shadow position]], [[sweetheart position]], etc.\n\nCurved walks are done along a curve, rather than along a straight line.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Dance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glossary Of Dance Moves}}\n[[Category:Dance moves| ]]\n[[Category:Glossaries of dance|Dance moves]]\n", "name_user": "Anypodetos", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spell out abbreviation; fix link; etc.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_dance_moves"}
