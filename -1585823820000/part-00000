Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019. In 2020 the Carbon boom and spinnaker pole were approved as well. <ref name=\"Classrules\" /><ref name=\"Boom\" /> In 2020 the [[Soling North American Championship]] in [[Annapolis]], [[United States]], the Friendship League Championship in [[Brazil]] and many other Soling regatta's word wide were postponed due to [[COVID-19]]. <ref name=\"COVID-19\" />\n|}\n\n==Solings Built==\nOver the years about 4500 Solings were built. About 3700 of them were registered. The growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s was high. Then it stabilized. Since 2000 hardly any boats were built. <ref name=\"Guide1970\" /><ref name=\"Guide1971\" /><ref name=\"Guide1972\" /><ref name=\"Guide1973\" /><ref name=\"Guide1974\" /><ref name=\"Guide1975\" /><ref name=\"Guide1976\" /><ref name=\"Guide1977\" /><ref name=\"Guide1978\" /><ref name=\"Guide1981\" /><ref name=\"Guide1984\" /><ref name=\"Guide1988\" /><ref name=\"Guide1992\" /><ref name=\"Guide1996\" />\n[[File:Solings Built 1965 - 2020.png|left|Soling Built between 1965 - 2020]]\n{{clear}}\nThe following 36 boat builders were over the years licensed to built Solings:\n{| {{Table}}\n! # !!

Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019. In 2020 the Carbon boom and spinnaker pole were approved as well. <ref name=\"Classrules\" /><ref name=\"Boom\" /> In 2020 the [[Soling North American Championship]] in [[Annapolis]], [[United States]], the Friendship League Championship in [[Brazil]] and many other Soling regatta's word wide were postponed due to [[COVID-19]]. <ref name=\"COVID-19\" />\n|}\n\n==Solings Built==\nOver the years about 4500 Solings were built. About 3700 of them were registered. The growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s was high. Then it stabilized. Since 2000 hardly any boats were built. <ref name=\"Guide1970\" /><ref name=\"Guide1971\" /><ref name=\"Guide1972\" /><ref name=\"Guide1973\" /><ref name=\"Guide1974\" /><ref name=\"Guide1975\" /><ref name=\"Guide1976\" /><ref name=\"Guide1977\" /><ref name=\"Guide1978\" /><ref name=\"Guide1981\" /><ref name=\"Guide1984\" /><ref name=\"Guide1988\" /><ref name=\"Guide1992\" /><ref name=\"Guide1996\" />\n[[File:Solings Built 1965 - 2020.png|left|Soling Built between 1965 - 2020]]\n{{clear}}\nThe following 36 boat builders were over the years licensed to built Solings:\n{| {{Table}}\n! # !!

Because all the members went to various high schools in Pennsylvania, they were not old enough to play at some of the clubs and could only tour between semesters. Despite this, Code Orange Kids opened for such bands as the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[The Bronx (band)|The Bronx]], [[Nekromantix]] and [[Anti-Flag]].<ref name=\"ppg1\"/><ref name=\"ppg2\"/> Early self-published releases from Code Orange Kids included 2009's ''Winter Tour Demo'',<ref name=\"ppg1\"/> 2010's ''Demo 2010''<ref name=\"ppg1\"/> and 2011's ''Embrace Me/Erase Me''.<ref name=\"absolutepunk2\"/> Code Orange Kids released the EP ''Cycles'' through Mayfly Records in 2011.<ref name=\"altpress4\"/>\n\nCode Orange Kids announced they signed to [[Deathwish Inc.]] in January 2012.

Speaking on the sound of the new album, Morgan said it would mark \"a very new era for our band,\" and that, \"It's different. A lot of the heavier parts are heavier and sometimes more obvious.

Variations include ''aloo bhatura'' (bhatura filled with potato) and paneer bhatura (bhatura filled with cottage cheese). It is often eaten with [[chickpea]] [[curry]], ''[[chana masala|chole]]'' or ''channe'', making the traditional dish ''[[chole bhature]]''.\n\nThis bread is like the [[Puri (food)|puri]] bread but is made with leavened dough.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramineni |first=Shubhra |title=Entice With Spice: Easy Indian Recipes for Busy People |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpXTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT206}}</ref>\n\n==Ingredients==\nA typical recipe includes white [[flour]] (''maida''), [[dahi (curd)|dahi]] (yogurt), lots of'' [[ghee]]'' or oil, and either [[yeast]] or baking powder. Once kneaded well, the dough is left to rise, and then small balls of this dough are either hand-rolled or flattened using a rolling pin. The bread pieces are then deep fried until they puff up into a lightly browned, soft, fluffy bread, which is elastic and chewy.\nThey are known as Bhatura or Puri, Bhature is served more with chickpeas.\nIf you want complete and accurate information about making chickpea vegetable and bhatura.

The artistic style of the series has a similar look to ''Rugrats'' and  ''[[Rocket Power]]'' (another Klasky Csupo series). The background music was recycled from later episodes of ''Rugrats''.\n\nIn a format similar to ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', each episode starts and ends with a live-action segment.\n\nBy various accounts, the episodes turned out to be rather popular, to which individual McDonald's locations frequently ran out of VHS tapes, which were sold individually for $3.49 and could be bought with a small vanilla [[ice cream cone]] or [[Diet Coke]]. Klasky Csupo also sold them through their online [[gift shop]], which was shut down in fall 2005.\n\nA [[Happy Meal]] featuring [[Lego]] vehicles to build was released at the restaurant chain in 1999, a year after the series originally premiered.

Due to a sudden bout of stormy weather, the campers are forced to stay in the old house, where a holographic head named Franklin leads them through a challenging game which will eventually help them to escape. Along the way, the Fry Kids and McNuggets get caught in traps and are separated from the group and the rest face off against Franklin in a challenge of riddles. Tika, Hamburglar, and Birdie fail each riddle and are swept into traps, leaving only Ronald, Grimace, and Sundae to solve the final one, which they do. The holographic head turns out to be a child named Franklin programming the game with help from Tika (who wanted to give Ronald a challenge) and the McNuggets in a lab room. After Ronald gets a \"You Win\" out of Franklin, the scientist Dr. Quizzical returns to catch his son Franklin in the act and releases the others from their traps. Upon the group officially meeting Dr. Quizzical, he states that he had to leave a lecture he was giving early when he saw lightning on the mountain and that Franklin has done something like this before. Franklin apologizes to Ronald and the gang for his actions and is allowed to join their camping trip, becoming their new friend in the process.\n'''Note:''' The 1998 Klasky Csupo logo makes its debut on this episode.\n|LineColor=#FF6229\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|Title=The Legend of Grimace Island\n|DirectedBy=[[Jim Duffy (animator)|Jim Duffy]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Mark Zaslove]] and Eryk Casemiro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|1|22}}\n|ShortSummary=Ronald and the gang go out on a journey to Grimace Island (where Grimace's species is discovered) after Grimace receives a letter supposedly by the island's residents asking for help.

The gang then discovers that they were test subjects for Pinchworm's evil scheme to take over the world by using a bigger version of the ray to de-age the world's population into toddlers and babies. Despite the fact that the de-aging has left their abilities limited, Ronald and his friends set out to stop Pinchworm's scheme and restore themselves to their regular ages.\n'''Note:''' A new opening sequence was made for this episode and the next two.

The artistic style of the series has a similar look to ''Rugrats'' and  ''[[Rocket Power]]'' (another Klasky Csupo series). The background music was recycled from later episodes of ''Rugrats''.\n\nIn a format similar to ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', each episode starts and ends with a live-action segment.\n\nBy various accounts, the episodes turned out to be rather popular, to which individual McDonald's locations frequently ran out of VHS tapes, which were sold individually for $3.49 and could be bought with a small vanilla [[ice cream cone]] or [[Diet Coke]]. Klasky Csupo also sold them through their online [[gift shop]], which was shut down in fall 2005.\n\nA [[Happy Meal]] featuring [[Lego]] vehicles to build was released at the restaurant chain in 1999, a year after the series originally premiered. The front of each vehicle had an image of one of the McDonaldland characters in the Klasky Csupo style, as depicted in the series.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\nVoice talent on the series includes K-C veterans [[Christine Cavanaugh]], [[Kath Soucie]], and [[Charlie Adler]].

Due to a sudden bout of stormy weather, the campers are forced to stay in the old house, where a holographic head named Franklin leads them through a challenging game which will eventually help them to escape. Along the way, the Fry Kids and McNuggets get caught in traps and are separated from the group and the rest face off against Franklin in a challenge of riddles. Tika, Hamburglar, and Birdie fail each riddle and are swept into traps, leaving only Ronald, Grimace, and Sundae to solve the final one, which they do. The holographic head turns out to be a child named Franklin programming the game with help from Tika (who wanted to give Ronald a challenge) and the McNuggets in a lab room. After Ronald gets a \"You Win\" out of Franklin, the scientist Dr. Quizzical returns to catch his son Franklin in the act and releases the others from their traps. Upon the group officially meeting Dr. Quizzical, he states that he had to leave a lecture he was giving early when he saw lightning on the mountain and that Franklin has done something like this before. Franklin apologizes to Ronald and the gang for his actions and is allowed to join their camping trip, becoming their new friend in the process.\n'''Note:''' The 1998 Klasky Csupo logo makes its debut on this episode.\n|LineColor=#FF6229\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|Title=The Legend of Grimace Island\n|DirectedBy=[[Jim Duffy (animator)|Jim Duffy]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Mark Zaslove]] and Eryk Casemiro\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|1|22}}\n|ShortSummary=Ronald and the gang go out on a journey to Grimace Island (where Grimace's species is discovered) after Grimace receives a letter supposedly by the island's residents asking for help.

Later, Hamburglar gets abducted by real aliens after foolishly accepting an offer to go on vacation with them, not realizing until too late that the vacation will end up keeping him away from Earth for thousands of years. Despite being angry at him for his lie and prank, Ronald and his friends go on a mission in outer space to rescue Hamburglar.\n'''Note:''' Ronald and Sundae go down the ball pit slide for the last time, as this is the last episode to have the original introduction and closing.

Pinchworm gives him tickets to a fake [[amusement park]] called Birthday World. During their visit, Ronald and his friends quickly become disappointed to find that most of the park's rides are broken and/or malfunctioning; they then ride a roller coaster which turns them into toddlers and babies with a ray. The gang then discovers that they were test subjects for Pinchworm's evil scheme to take over the world by using a bigger version of the ray to de-age the world's population into toddlers and babies. Despite the fact that the de-aging has left their abilities limited, Ronald and his friends set out to stop Pinchworm's scheme and restore themselves to their regular ages.\n'''Note:''' A new opening sequence was made for this episode and the next two.

offensive ways of describing [[COVID-19]]. These terms are linked to [[Wuhan]], where the virus was first detected, or China in general, via [[portmanteau]] with terms from traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]], ''Wushu'' and ''Kung Fu''. Use of these terms (popularised in social media and [[alt-right]] sources) not only downplays the seriousness of the deadly disease but also misinforms by suggesting it is a strain of [[influenza]] (when it is ''not'' a [[flu]]), while simultaneously mocking Chinese culture. It also implies that the pandemic is China's aggressive gift to the world, when actually thousands of Chinese suffered and died from COVID-19, especially in Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|title=Trump doubles down on 'China virus', demands to know who in White House used phrase 'Kung Flu'|date=2020-03-18|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329102358/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|title=A last, desperate pivot: Trump and his allies go full racist on coronavirus|date=2020-03-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329202750/https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Misinformation===\n{{main|Misinformation related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\nThe disease does not spread by shop items that have the name of \"Corona\" on them and products from China are not necessarily at risk of giving the disease either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|title=Coronavirus Is Not The 'Corona Beer Virus', What People Are Googling|last=Lee|first=Bruce Y.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316122432/https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|archive-date=16 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/can-i-get-coronavirus-from-a-package-being-delivered-from-china|title=Can I get coronavirus from a package delivered from China?|date=2020-02-26|website=Daily Breeze|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nBecause of its key role in the transmission and progression of SARS-CoV-2, [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2|ACE2]] has been the focus of a significant proportion of research and various [[Therapy|therapeutic]] approaches have been suggested.<ref name=\"Xu Zhong Deng Peng p.\"/> Personal hygiene, and a healthy lifestyle and [[Healthy diet|diet]] have been recommended to improve immunity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Li-sheng |last2=Wang |first2=Yi-ru |last3=Ye |first3=Da-wei |last4=Liu |first4=Qing-quan |title=A review of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) based on current evidence |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |date=19 March 2020 |page=105948 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105948 |pmid=32201353 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |language=en |issn=0924-8579 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327232545/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn order to improve and accelerate the exchange of data among researchers globally, the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] has started developing the European COVID-19 Data Platform. Understanding the biology, epidemiology, transmission, and evolution of the virus puts the scientific community one step closer to creating diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. One of the greatest challenges at this stage is finding ways to rapidly access and share data and results. The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to address this challenge by providing an open, trusted, and scalable platform where researchers can store and share relevant datasets. It will also create a shared computational space where scientists and public health workers can collaborate. The European COVID-19 Data Platform consists of two connected components: SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, which will organise the flow of sequence data from the outbreak and provide comprehensive open data sharing for the European and global research communities and COVID-19 Portal, which will bring together and continuously update relevant COVID-19 datasets and tools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/corona-updates/|title=EMBL\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-leads-international-collaboration-to-share-covid-19-research-data/?_ga=2.135566577.1552695299.1585763730-859685221.1575360586|title=EMBL-EBI leads International collaboration to share COVID-19 research data}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/covid-19|title=EMBL-EBI COVID-19 Data Platform}}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

Understanding the biology, epidemiology, transmission, and evolution of the virus puts the scientific community one step closer to creating diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. One of the greatest challenges at this stage is finding ways to rapidly access and share data and results. The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to address this challenge by providing an open, trusted, and scalable platform where researchers can store and share relevant datasets. It will also create a shared computational space where scientists and public health workers can collaborate. The European COVID-19 Data Platform consists of two connected components: SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, which will organise the flow of sequence data from the outbreak and provide comprehensive open data sharing for the European and global research communities and COVID-19 Portal, which will bring together and continuously update relevant COVID-19 datasets and tools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/corona-updates/|title=EMBL\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-leads-international-collaboration-to-share-covid-19-research-data/?_ga=2.135566577.1552695299.1585763730-859685221.1575360586|title=EMBL-EBI leads International collaboration to share COVID-19 research data}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/covid-19|title=EMBL-EBI COVID-19 Data Platform}}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

In contrast, [[MTV]], [[VH1]] and other [[North America]]n music-related television channels usually censor what they think is inappropriate and might be considered offensive to their viewers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2003-07-13-videos_x.htm|title=Music videos provocatively skirt the nudity issue|last=Elysa|first=Gardner|date=13 July 2003|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref>\n\n==Notable examples==\n{{Dynamic list|date=March 2014}}\n\n===1970s===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:26px;\"| Year !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:180px;\"| Music video !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Artist(s) !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:130px;\"| [[Music video director|Director]] !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:130px;\"| Nude person(s) !! style=white-space:nowrap | Nudity description\n|-\n|1978|| \"[[Bicycle Race]]\"<br><small>(uncensored version)</small> || [[Queen (band)|Queen]] || Dennis de Vallance || Female actors || 65 naked women racing bicycles at [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]].
