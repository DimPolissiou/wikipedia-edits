{"title_page": "Chloe Cooley", "text_new": "'''Chloe Cooley''' was a young black woman held as a slave in [[Fort Erie]] and [[Queenston]], [[Upper Canada]] in the late 1700s, as the area was being settled by Loyalists from the United States. Her owner Sergeant Adam Vrooman forced her into a boat to sell her in 1793 across the Niagara River in the United States\n\nThis incident was observed by several witnesses, who petitioned the Executive Council of Upper Canada. Although charges were dropped against Cooley's owner Sergeant Adam Vrooman, the incident is believed to have led to passage of the [[Act Against Slavery]], 1793, in Upper Canada. It prevented slaves from being imported into the province and provided for gradual abolition of slavery within a generation among those held there.\n\n==History==\nIn 1793 Cooley was held by [[Loyalist]] Adam Vrooman, a white farmer and former sergeant with [[Butler's Rangers]] who fled to Canada from New York after the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chloe-cooley-and-the-act-to-limit-slavery-in-upper-canada/|title=Chloe Cooley and the Act to Limit Slavery in Upper Canada|first=Natasha L.|last=Henry|work= The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> He had purchased her several months before from Benjamin Hardison, another Loyalist who lived nearby at what is now [[Fort Erie, Ontario]]. \n\nThe Crown had explicitly allowed Loyalists to bring slaves to Canada by the Imperial Act of 1790.

Some Black Loyalists, African-American slaves who had been freed by the British after leaving their rebel masters and joining the battle, had also been settled in Upper Canada, but most were resettled in [[Nova Scotia]]. The existence of slavery in the new provinces seemed a contradiction to the other rights which were protected for most residents.\n\nVrooman and other slaveholders feared losing their property rights in slaves, who were legally treated as chattel, and began to sell them off. Fearing that he would be forced to free Cooley, Vrooman arranged a sale, against her will, to an American across the Niagara River on March 14, 1793. In order to make the sale, Vrooman beat Cooley, tied her up and forced her into a small boat, aided by two other men. He rowed her across the river while she screamed.

The Chloe Cooley incident was considered a catalyst in the passage of Canada's first and only anti-slavery legislation: the ''[[Act Against Slavery]]'' (Its full name is \"An Act to Prevent the further Introduction of Slaves and to limit the Term of Contracts for Servitude (also known as the Act to Limit Slavery in Upper Canada)\").

It allowed the sale of slaves within the province and across the border into the United States. The last slave sale known took place in 1824. The law had three classes of persons: those held in slavery at the time of enactment would continue to be the property of their masters for life unless freed. Persons born to slave mothers would be granted freedom at age 25 (at that age they were judged able to support themselves), and masters were encouraged to employ them as indentured servants, for maximum terms up to nine years, which were renewable. Persons born to free blacks would be free from birth.\n\nIn 1799 New York State passed a similar law to gradually abolish slavery and forbid any more sales of slaves within its borders. The last slaves in New York were freed in 1827.

It is hosted at the [[Larmer Tree Gardens]], on the border of north [[Dorset]] and [[Wiltshire]], and usually takes place over the last weekend of August or the first full weekend in September, opening camping on Thursday afternoon with the entertainment running, since 2016, from Thursday evening to Sunday inclusive. The first festival took place in 2006, and it sold out for the first time in 2008. It has sold out in advance every year since. The festival is independently run and started by two friends, Simon Taffe and Sofia Hagberg.\n\nThe festival is run over four stages: the Woods Stage, the Garden Stage, the Big Top Stage and the Tipi Tent, as well as a clearing in the woods around the Garden Stage containing a piano at which semi-secret sets take place. There are also children's areas and workshops, a healing field, a film tent, comedy, a library in the forest and a games area ([[ping pong]], [[table football]] etc.). Late night entertainment on offer usually includes high-profile DJ sets, a [[silent disco]], secret pop-up performances and [[karaoke]]. Due to the nature of the gardens the festival is set in it is not unusual to see [[Peafowl|peacocks]] wandering around the area and [[macaws]] in the trees.\n\nThe festival has a capacity of 15,000 (2014).<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=Daily Mirror | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/music/six-reasons-excited-end-road-3936271 | title=Six reasons to get excited about End of the Road festival | date=30 July 2014 | first=Nick | last=Sommerlad | accessdate=3 November 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the festival won an award for 'Best Small Festival' at [[UK Festival Awards]].

It is hosted at the [[Larmer Tree Gardens]], on the border of north [[Dorset]] and [[Wiltshire]], and usually takes place over the last weekend of August or the first full weekend in September, opening camping on Thursday afternoon with the entertainment running, since 2016, from Thursday evening to Sunday inclusive. The first festival took place in 2006, and it sold out for the first time in 2008. It has sold out in advance every year since. The festival is independently run and started by two friends, Simon Taffe and Sofia Hagberg.\n\nThe festival is run over four stages: the Woods Stage, the Garden Stage, the Big Top Stage and the Tipi Tent, as well as a clearing in the woods around the Garden Stage containing a piano at which semi-secret sets take place. There are also children's areas and workshops, a healing field, a film tent, comedy, a library in the forest and a games area ([[ping pong]], [[table football]] etc.). Late night entertainment on offer usually includes high-profile DJ sets, a [[silent disco]], secret pop-up performances and [[karaoke]]. Due to the nature of the gardens the festival is set in it is not unusual to see [[Peafowl|peacocks]] wandering around the area and [[macaws]] in the trees.\n\nThe festival has a capacity of 15,000 (2014).<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=Daily Mirror | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/music/six-reasons-excited-end-road-3936271 | title=Six reasons to get excited about End of the Road festival | date=30 July 2014 | first=Nick | last=Sommerlad | accessdate=3 November 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the festival won an award for 'Best Small Festival' at [[UK Festival Awards]].

Flights were intermittently discontinued during [[World War II]] due to the scarcity of [[spare part]]s, but by the end of the war the airline resumed operations. Two [[Stinson Reliant]]s bought from the [[Belgian Congo]] in 1944 permitted the carrier to resume coastal services. The [[DC-3]] and the [[Beechcraft Model 18]] joined the fleet in 1946.

Flights were intermittently discontinued during [[World War II]] due to the scarcity of [[spare part]]s, but by the end of the war the airline resumed operations. Two [[Stinson Reliant]]s bought from the [[Belgian Congo]] in 1944 permitted the carrier to resume coastal services. The [[DC-3]] and the [[Beechcraft Model 18]] joined the fleet in 1946.

They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance.

[[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.\n\n====Databases====\n{{main|Database}}\n{{Missing information|a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.|date=September 2018}}\nA database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s.\n\n===Computer applications===\n\n====Computer graphics and visualization====\n{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}\nComputer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and [[video game]]s.\n\n====Human\u2013computer interaction====\n{{main|Human\u2013computer interaction}}\nResearch that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.\n\n====Scientific computing and simulation====\n[[Scientific computing]] (or [[computational science]]) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[Science|scientific]] problems. A major usage of scientific computing is [[simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE,<ref>Muhammad H. Rashid, 2016. SPICE for Power Electronics and Electric Power. CRC Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-6047-2}}.</ref> as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs.

From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| [[File:Nicolas P.

It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software\u2014it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.\n\n==Discoveries==\nThe philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last = Rapaport|first = William J.|date = 20 September 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent \"anything\".{{refn |group=\"note\"|The word \"anything\" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}\n:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as \"on/off\", \"magnetized/de-magnetized\", \"high-voltage/low-voltage\", etc.).\n{{see also|Digital physics}}\n* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do \"anything\".\n:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:<ref>B.

Cengage Learning. p. 122. {{ISBN|0-538-47866-7}}.</ref>\n\n:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:\n::*''sequence'': first do this, then do that;\n::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;\n::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.\n:: Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).\n{{see also|Elementary function arithmetic#Friedman's grand conjecture}}\n\n==Programming paradigms==\n{{main|Programming paradigm}}\n\nProgramming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:\n\n* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.<ref>Md. Rezaul Karim; Sridhar Alla; 2017. Scala and Spark for Big Data Analytics: Explore the concepts of functional programming, data streaming, and machine learning. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 87. {{ISBN|978-1-78355-050-0}}.</ref>\n* [[Imperative programming]], a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.<ref>Lex Sheehan, 2017. Learning Functional Programming in Go: Change the way you approach your applications using functional programming in Go. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-1-78728-604-7}}.</ref> In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\n* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, 2015. Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation. Wiley. p. 245. {{ISBN|978-1-118-98730-8}}.</ref>\n\nMany languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Multi-Paradigm Programming Language |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |website=developer.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052407/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |archive-date=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Academia==\n{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}\nConferences are important events for computer science research.

Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{main|Philosophy of computer science}}\nA number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science.

They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.\n\n===Computer systems===\n\n====Computer architecture and computer engineering====\n{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}\nComputer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.

AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| [[File:Nicolas P.

Common programming paradigms include:\n\n* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.<ref>Md. Rezaul Karim; Sridhar Alla; 2017.

Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\n* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, 2015. Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation.

He played hurling with his local club [[Rathnure GAA|Rathnure]] and with the [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] senior inter-county team<ref>{{cite web|title=Hurling All Stars 1971 |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/hurlingallstars.html |work=RT\u00c9 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031150129/http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/hurlingallstars.html |archivedate=31 October 2010 }}</ref> in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\n\nQuigley played his club [[hurling]] with the famous [[Rathnure GAA|Rathnure]] club and enjoyed much success.  He won his first senior [[Wexford Senior Hurling Championship|county title]] with the club in 1971.  It was the first of a famous four-in-a-row as further county titles were annexed in 1972, 1973 and 1974.  These wins were converted into [[Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship|Leinster]] club titles in 1971 and 1973.  Quigley won further county medals in 1977, 1979 and 1980.  He continued his club hurling well into the 1980s, winning both county and Leinster titles in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Inter-county===\n\nQuigley first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] minor hurling team in the 1960s.  He won a [[Leinster Minor Hurling Championship|Leinster]] title in this grade in 1967 before later lining out in his first All-Ireland final.  [[Cork GAA|Cork]] provided the opposition on that occasion and went on to claim a 2\u201315 to 5\u20133 victory.  Quigley won second Leinster minor medal in 1968 before lining out in a second All-Ireland final.  Cork were the opponents once again, however, the result was the same as 'the Rebels' took the title with a 2\u201313 to 3\u20137 win.\n\nIn 1969 Quigley moved up to the under-21 grade.  In this grade he won a [[Leinster Under-21 Hurling Championship|Leinster]] title in 1969 before later lining out in the All-Ireland final.  A Cork team that he was well used to provided the opposition on that occasion and won the game by 5\u201313 to 4\u20137.  Quigley added a second Leinster under-21 title to his collection in 1970 before later playing in his second consecutive All-Ireland final.  Once again Cork provided the opposition, however, the game ended in a draw.  The replay proved more conclusive as 'the Rebels' trounced Quigley's side by 5\u201317 to 0\u20138.  In 1971 Quigley was appointed captain of the under-21 team.  That year he collected a third consecutive Leinster medal before lining out in the All-Ireland final.  For the fifth year in-a-row Quigley faced Cork in a championship decider and, unfortunately, Cork made it five out of five with a 7\u20138 to 1\u201311 victory over the Leinster men.\n\nBy this stage Quigley had already made his debut on the Wexford senior team.  He won a senior [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Leinster]] medal in 1970 as All-Ireland champions [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] fell in the provincial final.  [[Galway GAA|Galway]] were defeated in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Cork, Quigley's b\u00eate noire an underage levels.  For the first time ever the final would be contested over eighty minutes instead of the usual sixty.  The game itself was an exciting affair with a record sixty-four scores and eleven goals in all.  After a free-flowing game Cork emerged victorious by 6\u201321 to 5\u201310.\n\nQuigley played in his next Leinster final in 1971. The Kilkenny team of that era, a team often described as the greatest of all time, provided the opposition on that occasion.  In fact, it was the first of five successive defeats at the hands of Kilkenny in Leinster finals for Wexford; however, Quigley missed the 1972 decider.\n\nIn spite of a lack of success in the championship Wexford reached the final of the [[National Hurling League]] in 1973.  On that occasion [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] were the opponents, however, victory went to Wexford giving Quigley his first major title at senior level.\n\n1976 saw Wexford and Kilkenny battle it out in the Leinster final for the seventh year in succession.  'The Cats' were going for a provincial six in-a-row and an All-Ireland three-in-a-row, however, Wexford shocked the reigning champions by 2\u201320 to 1\u20136.  It was a trouncing that nobody expected and it gave Quigley his second Leinster medal.  Wexford's championship campaign nearly came unstuck in their next game against Galway.  A high-scoring game ended in a 5\u201314 to 2\u201323 draw and a replay was forced at the newly opened [[P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]].  The second game was just as tense an affair, however, Wexford emerged victorious by 3\u201314 to 2\u201314.  Their opponents in the All-Ireland final were [[Cork GAA|Cork]], a team looking for their first championship title since 1970 when they defeated Wexford.  Quigley's side got off to a great start and led by 2\u20132 to no score after just six minutes, however, Cork settled down and were spurred on with an inspirational display by [[Pat Moylan (Cork hurler)|Pat Moylan]].  The sides were level at the interval; however, the second-half developed into what was arguably the finest final of the decade.  Cork hung on to win by 2\u201321 to 4\u201311 as Quigley was left on the losing side.\n\nIn 1977 Wexford maintained their provincial dominance with another defeat of Kilkenny.  It was Quigley's third Leinster medal and the defeat for 'the Cats' brought the curtain down on [[Eddie Keher]]'s inter-county career.  Victory in the provincial final allowed Wexford to advance directly to the All-Ireland final.  For the second year in-a-row Cork provided the opposition and another classic looked likely.  Wet and windy weather severely hampered both teams, however, the game was still a close affair.  For the second year in-a-row Quigley ended up on the losing side as Cork claimed a 1\u201317 to 3\u20138 victory.\n\nIn 1978 Kilkenny were back as champions of Leinster and Wexford had to go back to the drawing board.  A new force in the province also emerged as [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] won their first Leinster titles in 1980 and 1981.  Quigley continued playing hurling well into the 1980s, however, after several defeats in the provincial championship he retired from inter-county hurling in 1988.\n\n===Provincial===\n\nQuigley also lined out with [[Leinster GAA|Leinster]] in the inter-provincial hurling competition.  He first played for his province in 1973 as Leinster defeated [[Munster GAA|Munster]] to take the [[Railway Cup]].  Quigley added further Railway Cup medals to his collection in 1974, 1975 and 1977.\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\nTowards the end of Quigley's playing days the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] celebrated its centenary year in 1984.  Throughout the year a series of special events were held while special team selections were also named.  While a special [[GAA Hurling Team of the Century]] was named, a special team of players who never won an [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medal was also selected.  Quigley's contributions as a player were recognised when he was picked in the left centre-forward position on that 'fantasy' team.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{succession box\n| before = [[Teddy O'Connor]]\n| title = [[List of Wexford senior hurling team captains|Wexford Senior Hurling Captain]]\n| years = 1973\u20131974\n| after = [[Teddy O'Connor]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n| before = \n| title = [[List of Wexford senior hurling team captains|Wexford Senior Hurling Captain]]\n| years = 1981\n| after = \n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Teams==\n{{Rathnure Hurling Team 1972}}\n{{Rathnure Hurling Team 1974}}\n{{Rathnure Hurling Team 1978}}\n{{Wexford Minor Hurling Team 1968}}\n{{Wexford Hurling Team 1970}}\n{{Wexford Hurling Team 1976}}\n{{Wexford Hurling Team 1977}}\n{{Wexford hurling team managers}}\n{{1973 Hurling All Stars}}\n{{1974 Hurling All Stars}}\n{{1975 Hurling All Stars}}\n{{1976 Hurling All Stars}}\n{{Hurling Team of the Century 2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quigley, Martin}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Rathnure hurlers]]\n[[Category:Wexford inter-county hurlers]]\n[[Category:Leinster inter-provincial hurlers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox Gaelic Athletic Association player\n| code = Hurling\n| sport = Hurling\n| image = \n| name = Martin Quigley\n| irish = M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Coigligh\n| fullname = Martin Quigley\n| feet = 6\n| inches = 0\n| county = Wexford\n| province = Leinster\n| club = [[Rathnure GAA|Rathnure]]\n| clposition = Forward\n| clubs = \n| clyears = \n| clapps(points) = \n| clcounty = \n| clprovince = \n| clallireland = \n| counties = Wexford\n| icposition = Forward\n| icyears = 1970s-1980s\n| icapps(points) = \n| icprovince = 3\n| icallireland = 0\n| nhl = 1\n| allstars = 4\n| clupdate = \n| icupdate = \n| birth_date = {{birth year and age|1951}}\n| birth_place = [[Rathnure]], [[County Wexford]]\n}}\n\n'''Martin Quigley''' (born 1951 in [[Rathnure]], [[County Wexford]]) is a retired [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] sportsman.  He played hurling with his local club [[Rathnure GAA|Rathnure]] and with the [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] senior inter-county team<ref>{{cite web|title=Hurling All Stars 1971 |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/hurlingallstars.html |work=RT\u00c9 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031150129/http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/hurlingallstars.html |archivedate=31 October 2010 }}</ref> in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\n\nQuigley played his club [[hurling]] with the famous [[Rathnure GAA|Rathnure]] club and enjoyed much success.  He won his first senior [[Wexford Senior Hurling Championship|county title]] with the club in 1971.  It was the first of a famous four-in-a-row as further county titles were annexed in 1972, 1973 and 1974.  These wins were converted into [[Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship|Leinster]] club titles in 1971 and 1973.  Quigley won further county medals in 1977, 1979 and 1980.  He continued his club hurling well into the 1980s, winning both county and Leinster titles in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Inter-county===\n\nQuigley first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] minor hurling team in the 1960s.  He won a [[Leinster Minor Hurling Championship|Leinster]] title in this grade in 1967 before later lining out in his first All-Ireland final.  [[Cork GAA|Cork]] provided the opposition on that occasion and went on to claim a 2\u201315 to 5\u20133 victory.  Quigley won second Leinster minor medal in 1968 before lining out in a second All-Ireland final.  Cork were the opponents once again, however, the result was the same as 'the Rebels' took the title with a 2\u201313 to 3\u20137 win.\n\nIn 1969 Quigley moved up to the under-21 grade.  In this grade he won a [[Leinster Under-21 Hurling Championship|Leinster]] title in 1969 before later lining out in the All-Ireland final.  A Cork team that he was well used to provided the opposition on that occasion and won the game by 5\u201313 to 4\u20137.  Quigley added a second Leinster under-21 title to his collection in 1970 before later playing in his second consecutive All-Ireland final.  Once again Cork provided the opposition, however, the game ended in a draw.  The replay proved more conclusive as 'the Rebels' trounced Quigley's side by 5\u201317 to 0\u20138.  In 1971 Quigley was appointed captain of the under-21 team.  That year he collected a third consecutive Leinster medal before lining out in the All-Ireland final.  For the fifth year in-a-row Quigley faced Cork in a championship decider and, unfortunately, Cork made it five out of five with a 7\u20138 to 1\u201311 victory over the Leinster men.\n\nBy this stage Quigley had already made his debut on the Wexford senior team.  He won a senior [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Leinster]] medal in 1970 as All-Ireland champions [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] fell in the provincial final.  [[Galway GAA|Galway]] were defeated in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Cork, Quigley's b\u00eate noire an underage levels.  For the first time ever the final would be contested over eighty minutes instead of the usual sixty.  The game itself was an exciting affair with a record sixty-four scores and eleven goals in all.  After a free-flowing game Cork emerged victorious by 6\u201321 to 5-10.\n\nQuigley played in his next Leinster final in 1971. The Kilkenny team of that era, a team often described as the greatest of all time, provided the opposition on that occasion.  In fact, it was the first of five successive defeats at the hands of Kilkenny in Leinster finals for Wexford; however, Quigley missed the 1972 decider.\n\nIn spite of a lack of success in the championship Wexford reached the final of the [[National Hurling League]] in 1973.  On that occasion [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] were the opponents, however, victory went to Wexford giving Quigley his first major title at senior level.\n\n1976 saw Wexford and Kilkenny battle it out in the Leinster final for the seventh year in succession.  'The Cats' were going for a provincial six in-a-row and an All-Ireland three-in-a-row, however, Wexford shocked the reigning champions by 2\u201320 to 1\u20136.  It was a trouncing that nobody expected and it gave Quigley his second Leinster medal.  Wexford's championship campaign nearly came unstuck in their next game against Galway.  A high-scoring game ended in a 5\u201314 to 2\u201323 draw and a replay was forced at the newly opened [[P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]].  The second game was just as tense an affair, however, Wexford emerged victorious by 3\u201314 to 2-14.  Their opponents in the All-Ireland final were [[Cork GAA|Cork]], a team looking for their first championship title since 1970 when they defeated Wexford.  Quigley's side got off to a great start and led by 2\u20132 to no score after just six minutes, however, Cork settled down and were spurred on with an inspirational display by [[Pat Moylan (Cork hurler)|Pat Moylan]].  The sides were level at the interval; however, the second-half developed into what was arguably the finest final of the decade.  Cork hung on to win by 2\u201321 to 4-11 as Quigley was left on the losing side.\n\nIn 1977 Wexford maintained their provincial dominance with another defeat of Kilkenny.  It was Quigley's third Leinster medal and the defeat for 'the Cats' brought the curtain down on [[Eddie Keher]]'s inter-county career.  Victory in the provincial final allowed Wexford to advance directly to the All-Ireland final.  For the second year in-a-row Cork provided the opposition and another classic looked likely.
