It depicts a nude young woman, traditionally identified with the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a [[Renaissance]] palace. It is now in the [[Galleria degli Uffizi]] in [[Florence]].\n\nThe figure's pose is based on the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Dresden Venus]]'', traditionally attributed to [[Giorgione]] but which Titian at least completed the landscape. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit; some even believe the figure is engaging in [[masturbation]]. <ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000f1t2</ref> . Devoid as it is of any classical or allegorical trappings \u2013 Venus displays none of the attributes of the goddess she is supposed to represent \u2013 the painting is sensual and  unapologetically [[erotic]].\n\nInterpretations of the painting fall into two groups; both agree that the painting has a powerful erotic charge, but beyond that it is seen either as a portrait of a courtesan, perhaps Zaffetta, or as a painting celebrating the marriage of its first owner (who according to some may not have commissioned it).  This disagreement forms part of a wider debate on the meaning of the mainly Venetian tradition of the reclining female nude, which Titian had created, or helped to create, some 25 years before with the [[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|''Dresden Venus'']] of around 1510\u201311.  For [[Charles Hope (art historian)|Charles Hope]], \"It has yet to be shown that the most famous example of this genre, Titian's ''Venus of Urbino'', is anything other than a representation of a beautiful nude woman on a bed, devoid of classical or even allegorical content.\"<ref>Hope, 56</ref>  Even the indefatigable finder of allegories drawing on [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]], [[Edgar Wind]], had to admit that in this case \"an undisguised hedonism had at last dispelled the Platonic metaphors\".<ref>Wind, 141</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe Venus stares straight at the viewer, unconcerned with her nudity. In her right hand she holds a posy of roses whilst she holds her other hand over her genitals. In the near background is a dog, often a symbol of fidelity.  In a different space in the background two maids are shown rummaging through a ''[[cassone]]'' chest, where clothes were kept.\n\nThe detailed depiction of the interior setting is unusual, perhaps unique, in Titian.<ref>Goffen (1997a), 83-84</ref>  Titian contracted for the 21 year old [[Ippolito de' Medici]], reluctantly made a cardinal (though not a priest), by his uncle, [[Pope Clement VII]]. He was trying to pursue a military career, and was a papal diplomat. On 20 October 1532 he spent the night in Venice with Angela del Moro, or Angela Zaffetta, a leading courtesan in Venice and sometimes a dining companion of Titian and [[Pietro Aretino|Aretino]], the latter a friend of the cardinal.  Titian painted Ippolito's portrait, and it seems likely that he was asked to add a nude portrait of Angela Zaffetta, or that Titian decided to paint one in the hope he would like it.<ref>Hale, 337-341</ref>[[File:Johan_Zoffany_-_Tribuna_of_the_Uffizi_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|[[Johan Zoffany]], ''[[Tribuna of the Uffizi (painting)|The Tribuna of the Uffizi]]'', 1770s]]\nOn 20 December 1534 Titian wrote to Ippolito's chamberlain in Rome saying that he had been working on a painting of a woman for the cardinal.  Ippolito died in August 1535, and apparently never saw the painting, which was still in Titian's studio when [[Guidobaldo II della Rovere]], the 24-year-old son of the [[Duke of Urbino]] came in January 1538 to sit for a portrait.  As letters from him and his mother show, he was extremely keen to buy it, and did so some months later; he refers to it simply as \"the nude woman\", and was worried Titian would sell it to someone else.<ref>Hale, 341-345</ref>  Later that year he inherited the [[Duchy of Urbino]] on the death of his father, hence the painting acquired the name by which it is usually known, although it seems it was mostly kept in [[Pesaro]] from early on.\n\nAlternatively, the painting may have been commissioned by Guidobaldo, possibly to celebrate his marriage in 1534 to the 10 year-old Giulia Varano, which made him [[Duke of Camerino]], or its consummation, which was probably a few years later.<ref>Goffen (1997a), 81</ref>  Some critics have seen references to marriage in details such as the maids at the ''cassone'', where the ''corredo'' or [[Hope chest|trousseau]] of clothes generally given to the bride by her husband's family were stored.  Rona Goffen sees Venus's hand \"caressing\" her genitals as such a reference, as it was believed at the time that a female \"emission\" or orgasm was necessary for conception to take place, and [[Masturbation#Female|female masturbation]] was therefore allowed only in cases where the male had ejaculated and withdrawn.  The production of heirs was of great concern in elite marriages. Even the little dog on the bed has been brought into the argument; an identical dog is shown in Titian's portrait of the duke's mother [[Eleonora Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino|Eleonora Gonzaga]], the reasoning being that the dog identifies the house as a della Rovere home, and that it remains quiet indicates that the viewer is the husband of the woman.<ref>Goffen (1997b), 151-152; Sheila Hale finds talk of the dog \"absurd\", 762, note 5</ref>  \n[[Image:Manet, Edouard - Olympia, 1863.jpg|thumb|right|[[\u00c9douard Manet|\u00c9douard Manet's]] ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]],'' 1863]]\n\n===Later history===\nIn 1624, as the Papacy moved to fully annex the duchy to the [[Papal States]], the della Rovere court moved to [[Pesaro]], where the painting hung in the Villa Imperiale.

He proposed that \"it was painted for a [[bagnio]] [brothel], and it was probably refused because it was a trifle too strong\", adding humorously that \"in truth, it is a trifle too strong for any place but a public art gallery\". Twain does this to juxtapose the artistic license (for nudity, for example) allowed in painting, as opposed to the restrictions and Victorian morality imposed on literature in the \"last eighty or ninety years\".

Olympia was modelled by [[Victorine Meurent]] and Olympia's servant by the [[art model]] [[Laure (art model)|Laure]]. Olympia's confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute. The French government acquired the painting in 1890 after a public subscription organized by [[Claude Monet]]. The painting is on display at the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]].\n\n== Content ==\nWhat shocked contemporary audiences was not Olympia's nudity, nor the presence of her fully clothed maid, but her confrontational gaze and a number of details identifying her as a ''[[Demimondaine|demi-mondaine]]'' or prostitute.<ref name=\"Smart History\" /> These include the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings and the oriental shawl on which she lies, symbols of wealth and sensuality. The black ribbon around her neck, in stark contrast with her pale flesh, and her cast-off slipper underline the voluptuous atmosphere. \"Olympia\" was a name associated with prostitutes in 1860s Paris.<ref>[[T. J. Clark (art historian)|Clark, T.J.]] (1999) ''The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and His Followers.'' Revised edition. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.86.</ref>\n\nThe painting is modelled after [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' (c. 1534).<ref>{{cite book|last=Millett-Gallant|first=Ann|title=The Disabled Body in Contemporary Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVDIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA31|accessdate=6 September 2014|date=3 August 2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-10997-1|pages=31\u2013}}</ref> Whereas the left hand of Titian's Venus is curled and appears to entice, Olympia's left hand appears to block, which has been interpreted as symbolic of her sexual independence from men and her role as a prostitute, granting or restricting access to her body in return for payment. Manet replaced the little dog (symbol of fidelity) in Titian's painting with a black cat, which traditionally symbolized prostitution. Olympia disdainfully ignores the flowers presented to her by her servant, probably a gift from a client. Some have suggested that she is looking in the direction of the door, as her client barges in unannounced.\n\nThe painting deviates from the academic canon in its style, characterized by broad, quick brushstrokes, {{clarify span|text=studio lighting|date=February 2020}} that eliminates mid-tones, large color surfaces and shallow depth. Unlike the smooth idealized nude of [[Alexandre Cabanel]]'s [[The Birth of Venus (Cabanel)|''La naissance de V\u00e9nus'']], also painted in 1863, Olympia is a real woman whose nakedness is emphasized by the harsh lighting.<ref name=\"Smart History\" /> The canvas alone is 51.4 x 74.8 inches, which is rather large for this [[Genre painting|genre-style painting]]. Most paintings that were this size depicted historical or mythological events, so the size of the work, among other factors, caused surprise. Finally, Olympia is fairly thin by the artistic standards of the time and her relatively undeveloped body is more girlish than womanly. [[Charles Baudelaire]] thought thinness was more indecent than fatness.<ref>[[Theodore Reff|Reff, Theodore]]. (1976) ''Manet: Olympia''.

Olympia was modelled by [[Victorine Meurent]] and Olympia's servant by the [[art model]] [[Laure (art model)|Laure]]. Olympia's confrontational gaze caused shock and astonishment when the painting was first exhibited because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute. The French government acquired the painting in 1890 after a public subscription organized by [[Claude Monet]]. The painting is on display at the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], [[Paris]].\n\n== Content ==\nWhat shocked contemporary audiences was not Olympia's nudity, nor the presence of her fully clothed maid, but her confrontational gaze and a number of details identifying her as a ''[[Demimondaine|demi-mondaine]]'' or prostitute.<ref name=\"Smart History\" /> These include the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, pearl earrings and the oriental shawl on which she lies, symbols of wealth and sensuality. The black ribbon around her neck, in stark contrast with her pale flesh, and her cast-off slipper underline the voluptuous atmosphere. \"Olympia\" was a name associated with prostitutes in 1860s Paris.<ref>[[T. J. Clark (art historian)|Clark, T.J.]] (1999) ''The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and His Followers.'' Revised edition. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.86.</ref>\n\nThe painting is modelled after [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' (c. 1534).<ref>{{cite book|last=Millett-Gallant|first=Ann|title=The Disabled Body in Contemporary Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVDIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA31|accessdate=6 September 2014|date=3 August 2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-10997-1|pages=31\u2013}}</ref> Whereas the left hand of Titian's Venus is curled and appears to entice, Olympia's left hand appears to block, which has been interpreted as symbolic of her sexual independence from men and her role as a prostitute, granting or restricting access to her body in return for payment. Manet replaced the little dog (symbol of fidelity) in Titian's painting with a black cat, which traditionally symbolized prostitution. Olympia disdainfully ignores the flowers presented to her by her servant, probably a gift from a client. Some have suggested that she is looking in the direction of the door, as her client barges in unannounced.\n\nThe painting deviates from the academic canon in its style, characterized by broad, quick brushstrokes, {{clarify span|text=studio lighting|date=February 2020}} that eliminates mid-tones, large color surfaces and shallow depth. Unlike the smooth idealized nude of [[Alexandre Cabanel]]'s [[The Birth of Venus (Cabanel)|''La naissance de V\u00e9nus'']], also painted in 1863, Olympia is a real woman whose nakedness is emphasized by the harsh lighting.<ref name=\"Smart History\" /> The canvas alone is 51.4 x 74.8 inches, which is rather large for this [[Genre painting|genre-style painting]]. Most paintings that were this size depicted historical or mythological events, so the size of the work, among other factors, caused surprise. Finally, Olympia is fairly thin by the artistic standards of the time and her relatively undeveloped body is more girlish than womanly. [[Charles Baudelaire]] thought thinness was more indecent than fatness.<ref>[[Theodore Reff|Reff, Theodore]]. (1976) ''Manet: Olympia''.

It is the first station passed by eastward trains from [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], and it is the only station in Queens shared by the Port Washington Branch and other LIRR branches. East of Woodside the two-track Port Washington Branch turns eastward, while the four-track Main Line continues southeast to [[Jamaica station]].\n\nWoodside has six tracks and three platforms. The four southernmost tracks passing through the station are the Main Line tracks; the two center tracks on the Main Line are through (express) tracks and do not have platform faces at Woodside. The two northernmost tracks are the Port Washington branch tracks, both of which have platforms. West of the station, the line merges with Amtrak's [[Hell Gate Bridge]] access tracks (part of the [[Northeast Corridor]]) at [[Harold Interlocking]] before entering the [[East River Tunnels]] to [[Manhattan]]. The [[61st Street\u2013Woodside (IRT Flushing Line)|61st Street\u2013Woodside]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}) station is above Woodside station, on a viaduct high above [[Roosevelt Avenue]]. The station is [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] via elevators and ramps.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Woodside platform jeh.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The platform at Woodside station]]\nWoodside originally had two railroad stations. One was built in 1861 on 60th Street by the LIRR subsidiary [[New York and Jamaica Railroad]]; the other, larger station was built by the [[Flushing and North Side Railroad]] on November 15, 1869, and was the first to be built by the F&NS after acquiring the troubled [[New York and Flushing Railroad]].\n\nFor a short period during the 1870s, it served not only the Port Washington Branch but also the [[Woodside Branch]]. The Woodside Branch ran across northwestern Queens, had one station at Junction Boulevard and 35th Avenue, and took commuters either to the former [[Whitestone Branch]] or to what is today [[Corona Yard]]. Like all other stations on Long Island, it was acquired by the Long Island Railroad in 1876, but in this case the former LIRR-built station was abandoned. <!--The station was burned in a fire on February 2, 1894.-->\n\nThough the line was electrified on June 16, 1910, the station was closed in 1914 due to a grade elimination project and razed on November 17, 1915. The existing elevated station was opened on October 17, 1915. When [[Winfield (LIRR station)|Winfield]] station was closed in 1929, Woodside became the station for Main Line and Port Washington Branch trains before the split at Winfield Junction. <!--In 1970, a transformer fire at Penn Station halted LIRR service west of Woodside during morning rush hour. 50,000 commuters delayed and 23,000 were crowded onto the subway station at 61st Street.--> A restoration project took place in 1999.\n\nIn 2006, an 18-year-old woman died after falling into the gap between the platform and train, and subsequently getting hit by an oncoming passenger train.<ref name=\"ntsb-rab0901\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/RAB0901.pdf|page=1|date=March 13, 2009|orig-year=2006|lay-url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/RAB0901.aspx|title=Railroad Accident Brief RAB-09-01|website=www.ntsb.gov|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"wnbc2009\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mother-of-lirr-train-gap-victim-committs-suicide/1896011/|via=[[Associated Press]]|title=Mother Of Teen Who Died In LIRR Train Gap Commits Suicide|publisher=[[WNBC|NBC New York]]|language=en-US|date=May 19, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330081634/https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mother-of-lirr-train-gap-victim-committs-suicide/1896011/|archive-date=March 30, 2020 |access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> The death resulted in the LIRR and [[Metro-North Railroad]] implementing an aggressive  [[Platform_gap#Mitigation|platform gap mitigation]]<ref name=\"ntsb-rab0901\" />{{rp|7}} platform conductor personnel, and \"[[Mind_the_gap#Americas|Watch the gap]]\" programs.<ref name=\"castillo2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/ntsb-series-of-circumstances-led-to-gap-fall-death-1.1213257|title=NTSB: Series of circumstances led to gap fall death|last=Castillo |first=Alfonso A. |date=June 24, 2009|work=[[Newsday]]|language=en|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"nysdot2006\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/news/press-releases/2006/2006-11-011|title=PTSB ISSUES INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS IN GAP INVESTIGATION : Long Island Railroad Already Implementing Measures|date=November 1, 2006|work=|access-date=March 30, 2020|publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322050646/https://www.dot.ny.gov/news/press-releases/2006/2006-11-011|archive-date=March 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ntsb-rab0901\" />{{rp|6}}\n\n==Station layout==\n\nThis station has three 12-car long high-level platforms.

It is the first station passed by eastward trains from [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], and it is the only station in Queens shared by the Port Washington Branch and other LIRR branches. East of Woodside the two-track Port Washington Branch turns eastward, while the four-track Main Line continues southeast to [[Jamaica station]].\n\nWoodside has six tracks and three platforms. The four southernmost tracks passing through the station are the Main Line tracks; the two center tracks on the Main Line are through (express) tracks and do not have platform faces at Woodside. The two northernmost tracks are the Port Washington branch tracks, both of which have platforms. West of the station, the line merges with Amtrak's [[Hell Gate Bridge]] access tracks (part of the [[Northeast Corridor]]) at [[Harold Interlocking]] before entering the [[East River Tunnels]] to [[Manhattan]]. The [[61st Street\u2013Woodside (IRT Flushing Line)|61st Street\u2013Woodside]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}) station is above Woodside station, on a viaduct high above [[Roosevelt Avenue]]. The station is [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] via elevators and ramps.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Woodside platform jeh.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The platform at Woodside station]]\nWoodside originally had two railroad stations. One was built in 1861 on 60th Street by the LIRR subsidiary [[New York and Jamaica Railroad]]; the other, larger station was built by the [[Flushing and North Side Railroad]] on November 15, 1869, and was the first to be built by the F&NS after acquiring the troubled [[New York and Flushing Railroad]].\n\nFor a short period during the 1870s, it served not only the Port Washington Branch but also the [[Woodside Branch]]. The Woodside Branch ran across northwestern Queens, had one station at Junction Boulevard and 35th Avenue, and took commuters either to the former [[Whitestone Branch]] or to what is today [[Corona Yard]]. Like all other stations on Long Island, it was acquired by the Long Island Railroad in 1876, but in this case the former LIRR-built station was abandoned. <!--The station was burned in a fire on February 2, 1894.-->\n\nThough the line was electrified on June 16, 1910, the station was closed in 1914 due to a grade elimination project and razed on November 17, 1915. The existing elevated station was opened on October 17, 1915. When [[Winfield (LIRR station)|Winfield]] station was closed in 1929, Woodside became the station for Main Line and Port Washington Branch trains before the split at Winfield Junction. <!--In 1970, a transformer fire at Penn Station halted LIRR service west of Woodside during morning rush hour. 50,000 commuters delayed and 23,000 were crowded onto the subway station at 61st Street.--> A restoration project took place in 1999.\n\nIn 2006, an 18-year-old woman died after falling into the gap between the platform and train, and subsequently getting hit by an oncoming passenger train.<ref name=\"ntsb-rab0901\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/RAB0901.pdf|page=1|date=March 13, 2009|orig-year=2006|lay-url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/RAB0901.aspx|title=Railroad Accident Brief RAB-09-01|website=www.ntsb.gov|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"wnbc2009\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mother-of-lirr-train-gap-victim-committs-suicide/1896011/|via=[[Associated Press]]|title=Mother Of Teen Who Died In LIRR Train Gap Commits Suicide|publisher=[[WNBC|NBC New York]]|language=en-US|date=May 19, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330081634/https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mother-of-lirr-train-gap-victim-committs-suicide/1896011/|archive-date=March 30, 2020 |access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> The death resulted in the LIRR and [[Metro-North Railroad]] implementing an aggressive  [[Platform_gap#Mitigation|platform gap mitigation]]<ref name=\"ntsb-rab0901\" />{{rp|7}} platform conductor personnel, and \"[[Mind_the_gap#Americas|Watch the gap]]\" programs.<ref name=\"castillo2>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/ntsb-series-of-circumstances-led-to-gap-fall-death-1.1213257|title=NTSB: Series of circumstances led to gap fall death|last=Castillo |first=Alfonso A. |date=June 24, 2009|work=[[Newsday]]|language=en|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"nysdot2006\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/news/press-releases/2006/2006-11-011|title=PTSB ISSUES INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS IN GAP INVESTIGATION : Long Island Railroad Already Implementing Measures|date=November 1, 2006|work=|access-date=March 30, 2020|publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322050646/https://www.dot.ny.gov/news/press-releases/2006/2006-11-011|archive-date=March 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ntsb-rab0901\" />{{rp|6}}\n\n==Station layout==\n\nThis station has three 12-car long high-level platforms.

Applied in the case of software, code written independently and distinctly different but producing the same results for the same inputs.\n[[Structures]] are usually designed with redundant parts as well, ensuring that if one part fails, the entire structure will not collapse. A structure without redundancy is called [[Fracture critical|fracture-critical]], meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure. Bridges that failed due to lack of redundancy include the [[Silver Bridge]] and the [[Skagit River Bridge|Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River]].\n\n[[File:Series-Parallel-Systems-Examples.jpg|thumb|Series (A) and parallel (B) systems and their combination (C).<ref>Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf</ref>]]\n\nParallel and combined systems demonstrate different level of redundancy. The models are subject of studies in reliability and safety engineering.\n\n== Function of redundancy ==\nThe two functions of redundancy are passive redundancy and [[active redundancy]]. Both functions prevent performance decline from exceeding specification limits without human intervention using extra capacity.\n\nPassive redundancy uses excess capacity to reduce the impact of component failures. One common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges. This extra strength allows some structural components to fail without bridge collapse. The extra strength used in the design is called the margin of safety.\n\nEyes and ears provide working examples of passive redundancy. Vision loss in one eye does not cause blindness but [[depth perception]] is impaired. Hearing loss in one ear does not cause deafness but directionality is lost. Performance decline is commonly associated with passive redundancy when a limited number of failures occur.\n\nActive redundancy eliminates performance declines by monitoring the performance of individual devices, and this monitoring is used in voting logic. The voting logic is linked to switching that automatically reconfigures the components. Error detection and correction and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are two examples of active redundancy.\n\n[[Electrical power distribution]] provides an example of active redundancy. Several power lines connect each generation facility with customers. Each power line includes monitors that detect overload. Each power line also includes circuit breakers. The combination of power lines provides excess capacity. Circuit breakers disconnect a power line when monitors detect an overload. Power is redistributed across the remaining lines.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Disadvantages==\n[[Charles Perrow]], author of ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.<ref name=perr2004/>\n\n== Voting logic ==\nVoting logic uses performance monitoring to determine how to reconfigure individual components so that operation continues without violating specification limitations of the overall system. Voting logic often involves computers, but systems composed of items other than computers may be reconfigured using voting logic. Circuit breakers are an example of a form of non-computer voting logic.\n\nElectrical power systems use [[power scheduling]] to reconfigure active redundancy. Computing systems adjust the production output of each generating facility when other generating facilities are suddenly lost. This prevents blackout conditions during major events such as an earthquake.\n\nThe simplest voting logic in computing systems involves two components: primary and alternate. They both run similar software, but the output from the alternate remains inactive during normal operation. The primary monitors itself and periodically sends an activity message to the alternate as long as everything is OK. All outputs from the primary stop, including the activity message, when the primary detects a fault. The alternate activates its output and takes over from the primary after a brief delay when the activity message ceases. Errors in voting logic can cause both outputs to be active or inactive at the same time, or cause outputs to flutter on and off.\n\nA more reliable form of voting logic involves an odd number of three devices or more. All perform identical functions and the outputs are compared by the voting logic. The voting logic establishes a majority when there is a disagreement, and the majority will act to deactivate the output from other device(s) that disagree. A single fault will not interrupt normal operation. This technique is used with [[avionics]] systems, such as those responsible for operation of the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\n== Calculating the probability of system failure ==\nEach duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:-\n\n:<math>{p}=  \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} </math>\nwhere:\n* <math>n</math> \u2013 number of components\n* <math> p_{i} </math> \u2013 probability of component i failing\n* <math>p</math> \u2013 the probability of all components failing (system failure)\n\nThis formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]] connected to the same socket in such a way that if one [[power supply]] failed, the other would too.\n\nIt also assumes that only one component is needed to keep the system running.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[degeneracy (biology)|Degeneracy]]\n* [[Common mode failure]]\n* [[Data redundancy]]\n* [[Double switching]]\n* [[Fault-tolerant design]]\n* [[Radiation hardening]]\n* [[Factor of safety]]\n* [[Reliability engineering]]\n* [[Reliability theory of aging and longevity]]\n* [[Safety engineering]]\n* [[Reliability (computer networking)]]\n* [[MTBF]]\n* [[N+1 redundancy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.eu-sparc.net Secure Propulsion using Advanced Redundant Control]\n* [https://yamar.com/articles/The-Vehicle-Power-Line-as-a-Redundant-Channel-for-CAN-Communication.pdf Using powerline as a redundant communication channel]\n* {{cite journal|title= A new modeling approach to the safety evaluation of N-modular redundant computer systems in presence of imperfect maintenance|journal= Reliability Engineering & System Safety|volume= 94|issue= 9|pages= 1422\u20131432|doi= 10.1016/j.ress.2009.02.014|year= 2009|last1= Flammini|first1= Francesco|last2= Marrone|first2= Stefano|last3= Mazzocca|first3= Nicola|last4= Vittorini|first4= Valeria|arxiv= 1304.6656}}\n\n{{Occupational safety and health}}\n{{Underwater diving}}\n\n[[Category:Engineering concepts]]\n[[Category:Reliability engineering]]\n[[Category:Safety]]\n[[Category:Fault tolerance]]\n[[Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems]]\n\n[[pl:Redundancja#In\u017cynieria]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Duplication of critical components to increase reliability of a system }}\n{{Other uses|Redundancy (disambiguation){{!}}Redundancy}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[File:PC-Netzteil (redundant).jpg|thumb|Redundant power supply]]\n[[File:Reliability block diagram.png|thumb|Redundant subsystem \"B\"]]\n[[File:Reisebus.Heck.jpg|thumb|upright|Extensively redundant rear lighting installation on a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[tour bus]]]]\n\nIn [[engineering]], '''redundancy''' is the duplication of critical [[component]]s or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [[system]], usually in the form of a backup or [[fail-safe]], or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of [[GNSS]] receivers, or [[multi-threaded]] computer processing.\n\nIn many [[safety-critical system]]s, such as [[fly-by-wire]] and [[hydraulic]] systems in [[aircraft]], some parts of the control system may be triplicated,<ref>[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf Redundancy Management Technique for Space Shuttle Computers] (PDF), IBM Research</ref> which is formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR).

There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]] connected to the same socket in such a way that if one [[power supply]] failed, the other would too.\n\nIt also assumes that only one component is needed to keep the system running.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[degeneracy (biology)|Degeneracy]]\n* [[Common mode failure]]\n* [[Data redundancy]]\n* [[Double switching]]\n* [[Fault-tolerant design]]\n* [[Radiation hardening]]\n* [[Factor of safety]]\n* [[Reliability engineering]]\n* [[Reliability theory of aging and longevity]]\n* [[Safety engineering]]\n* [[Reliability (computer networking)]]\n* [[MTBF]]\n* [[N+1 redundancy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.eu-sparc.net Secure Propulsion using Advanced Redundant Control]\n* [https://yamar.com/articles/The-Vehicle-Power-Line-as-a-Redundant-Channel-for-CAN-Communication.pdf Using powerline as a redundant communication channel]\n* {{cite journal|title= A new modeling approach to the safety evaluation of N-modular redundant computer systems in presence of imperfect maintenance|journal= Reliability Engineering & System Safety|volume= 94|issue= 9|pages= 1422\u20131432|doi= 10.1016/j.ress.2009.02.014|year= 2009|last1= Flammini|first1= Francesco|last2= Marrone|first2= Stefano|last3= Mazzocca|first3= Nicola|last4= Vittorini|first4= Valeria|arxiv= 1304.6656}}\n\n{{Occupational safety and health}}\n{{Underwater diving}}\n\n[[Category:Engineering concepts]]\n[[Category:Reliability engineering]]\n[[Category:Safety]]\n[[Category:Fault tolerance]]\n[[Category:Fault-tolerant computer systems]]\n\n[[pl:Redundancja#In\u017cynieria]]\n", "name_user": "UU", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)"}

The preparatory pastel and the print of the ''\"Vue de Quimperl\u00e9'' \"(1917) are good examples of his technique of first creating a pastel drawing from nature and then creating an engraving in the workshop.

In 1912 he started making [[woodcut]]s, on the advice of St\u00e9phane Pannemaker, but it was only later that he adopted the technique of making woodcuts with the knife to illustrate the 1920 book ''La Rapsode foraine et le Pardon de Sainte-Ann''e<ref name=\":0\" /> after the poem by [[Tristan Corbi\u00e8re]].\n\nA second part of his work deals with feminine grace, mutiny and the naivety of children.
