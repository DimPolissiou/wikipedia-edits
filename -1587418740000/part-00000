The [[flowerheads]] sit individually in the [[leaf axil]]s or on a [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]. These heads are subtended by 2 rows of free [[involucral bract]]s, the outer 3-5 are protruding, triangular in shape, broadest and leaflike, the inner lance-shaped, ascending and may be spiny. Each head consists of a whorl of yellow, infertile ray florets surrounding yellow disc florets that each have five long, free lobes. Adjacent each of the outer involucral bracts, several florets are fertile, and the surrounding parts of the common base of all florets in the head (or [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]) swell and eventually become woody. The receptacle breaks up at maturity, each section corresponding with one of the persistent outer bracts. These segments break free from the parent plant and act as the dispersal units.

Once an article is created, community members [[Collaboration|collaborate]] on it to improve its quality.

Logged in users can dismiss the warning in order to view the contents of the article. A system called New Article Boost allows certain users with the \"New Article Booster\" right to review these articles, and bring them up to standards if possible.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Get an Article Approved in wikiHow's Quality Review|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Get-an-Article-Approved-in-wikiHow%27s-Quality-Review|website=wikiHow|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Articles that meet these standards are \"promoted\", which removes the blurring effect as well as the notice, and makes the article publicly visible and searchable. If a New Article Booster finds a newly-written high-quality article, they can mark it as a Rising Star.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Rising-Star|title=wikiHow:Rising Star - wikiHow|website=www.wikihow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-23}}</ref> By default, RS-marked articles get promoted and placed on a main page for an unspecified period of time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Rising-Star-Quality-Article-on-wikiHow|title=How to Write a Rising Star Quality Article on wikiHow|work=wikiHow|access-date=2017-07-23|language=en}}</ref> Oppositely, articles below standards and that will take too much work to \"get ready for readers\" are \"demoted\", which removes them from the New Article Boost list and retains the blurring and notice, and moves the page to the \"Articles in Quality Review\" category.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wikihow.com/Use-the-wikiHow-New-Article-Boost-App|title=How to Use the wikiHow New Article Boost App|work=wikiHow|access-date=2017-07-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Deletion system====\nArticles with content that goes against the site's deletion policy are also demoted (such as articles centered around joke, sexually explicit, or hate-based topics, as well as severely inaccurate or incomplete instructions).<ref>{{cite web|title=wikiHow:Deletion Policy|url=http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Deletion-Policy|website=wikiHow}}</ref> Titles that are identified as duplicates per wikiHow's Merge Policy are merged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Merge-Policy|title=wikiHow:Merge Policy - wikiHow|website=www.wikihow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> Similar to Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Articles for deletion discussions]], wikiHow allows users to nominate an article that meets deletion criteria and have other users and admins discuss whether or not to delete. <ref>{{cite web |title=How to Nominate an Article for Deletion on wikiHow |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Nominate-an-Article-for-Deletion-on-wikiHow |website=wikiHow |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, like most wiki sites, wikiHow has a speedy deletion system for pages that are nonsensical, spam, inappropriate, etc. <ref>{{cite web |title=How to Tag an Article for Speedy Deletion on wikiHow |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Tag-an-Article-for-Speedy-Deletion-on-wikiHow |website=wikiHow |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Registration and user rights====\n[[File:WomenonWikiHow2-WM2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Workshop on women on wikiHow at [[Wikimania 2012]].]]\nLike many other wikis, registration is optional and privileges such as creating and editing articles are still available to those without an account. wikiHow complies with the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act|Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)]], and users are required to be at least 13 years old to register an account. COPPA is regularly enforced and site administrators are expected to block anyone confirmed to be underage, though editing privileges may be restored if the company receives a consent form signed by the user's parents or legal guardian.<ref>{{cite web|title=wikiHow:COPPA|url=http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:COPPA|website=wikiHow}}</ref>  Underage users can still edit anonymously, but they are advised not to post their personal information.\n\nOver 1 million people have created accounts and over 15,000 people edit wikiHow in a month and make changes for the purpose of informing others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Special:Statistics|url=http://wikihow.com/Special:Statistics|website=wikiHow|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> This community of volunteer contributors call themselves \"wikiHowians\". The most active, experienced, and trusted wikiHowians may gain additional editing privileges which help them administer and protect the website. New Article Boost rights are granted to users who have done at least 300 edits and pass a test (containing three different parts) demonstrating they understand wikiHow policies.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Become a New Article Booster on wikiHow|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-New-Article-Booster-on-wikiHow|website=wikiHow|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> People with these rights gain access to a special tool that allows them to edit recently written articles and ensure that their quality meets wikiHow's standards before the articles are publicly visible to all readers.

Most of the houses in Temescal are early twentieth century bungalows along tree-lined streets. There are also many multi-family homes and mid-size apartment complexes interspersed throughout the neighborhood.\n\nTemescal was an [[Italian-American]] neighborhood until the late 1960s. Temescal saw many changes in demographics in the past 10 years as new developments and upscale shopping and restaurants entered the neighborhood. Large numbers of young couples with children moved to Temescal as the real estate prices in nearby Rockridge grew too expensive for middle-class families. People of different racial and economic backgrounds live side by side in the neighborhood. Temescal is a diverse neighborhood with concentrations of [[Ethiopian American|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Americans|Eritrean]] [[immigrants]].\n\n==Public life==\nThe commercial heart of Temescal is Telegraph Avenue, between the [[MacArthur station (BART)|MacArthur BART Station]] and 51st Street. This area is known locally as the home to popular restaurants, such as North Light, <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/11/22/north-light-shines-with-a-revamped-brunch-menu}}</ref> Tara's Organic Ice Cream,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tarasorganic.com|title=Tara's Organic Ice Cream {{!}} Voted East Bay's 'Best Ice Cream Flavors'|last=MA|first=Bree Smith, eBree Web Design, Cambridge|website=www.tarasorganic.com|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> Roses' Tap Room, Cholita Linda, Aunt Mary's,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.auntmaryscafe.com/|title=Aunt Mary's Cafe: Comfort with a Twist!|website=www.auntmaryscafe.com|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> Bakesale Betty,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bakesalebetty.com/locations.php | title=Pagina principal| date=2018-08-06}}</ref> \nand Burma Superstar.\n\nAnother commercial zone runs along 40th St, between Broadway and Telegraph. This area includes a mixture of food service and retail. Restaurants along this stretch of 40th ave include Magpie serving gourmet pizza alongside 39 taps of craft beer, cider & wine, Bierhaus with a great selection of about a dozen German beers and bites, Homeroom mac-n-cheese, Subrosa Coffee, Oakland Yard Wine Bar and Tacos Oscar.\n\nThere are many Ethiopian restaurants here, especially on Telegraph north of 51st St. There are also many Korean establishments along Telegraph Ave. Temescal Farmers' Market, begun in 2006, is held on Sundays in the parking lot of the Department of Motor Vehicles facility on Claremont Ave.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061012203716/http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/2006/08/temescal-farmers-market-oakland.jsp]</ref> Mama's Royal Cafe, locally famous for breakfast, and Clove & Hoof are located on Broadway, near the border of Temescal and the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood.\n\nStudio One, located on 45th Street, is home to art classes and workshops. [[Omni Commons|Counter Culture Labs]] is a public laboratory and [[hackerspace]] located in the Temescal neighborhood. Royal Nonesuch Gallery is an artist run art and event space located on Telegraph and 43rd. Temescal Pool, located next door, is open to the public. The neighborhood is also home to several public and private schools, including Park Day School and the architectural landmark Oakland Technical High School on Broadway.\n\n==History==\nTemescal was originally a separate village that had built up around the estate of Vicente Peralta, which was located near the modern intersections of [[Telegraph Avenue]] and Claremont Boulevard.<ref name=legacies>{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Jeff|title=Temescal legacies : narratives of change from a North Oakland neighborhood|year=2006|publisher=Shared Ground|location=Oakland, Calif.|isbn=9780977889303}}</ref> (Vicente's estate was part of the larger [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Peralta Grant]] that spanned 44,800 acres of land in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay.]]) In 1897, the residents of Temescal voted to join the City of Oakland in an effort to gain access to higher quality public schools and police services.<ref name=legacies/><ref name=sfgate/> At the time that the City of Oakland annexed Temescal, Temescal was considered to consist of all land north of 36th Street (the northern bound of the City of Oakland at the time) between the Emeryville city limit to the west and Broadway to the east.<ref name=legacies/>\n\nThe word ''temescal'' derives from the word ''temescalli'', which means \"sweat house\" in the [[Nahuatl]] language of the [[Mexica]] (\"Aztec\") people of [[Mexico]]. It is surmised that the Peraltas or perhaps one of their ranch hands ([[cowboy|vaquero]]s) had seen local indigenous ([[Ohlone]]) structures along the creek similar to those in other parts of [[New Spain]] which were called ''temescalli''.\n\nTemescal has long been an important junction of several principal thoroughfares: Telegraph, Claremont, and [[Shattuck Avenue]]s, and 51st Street.[[Image:Temescalpool.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Temescal Pool on 45th St. in Oakland]]\n\nThe earliest telegraph wire from Oakland to Sacramento went through the area, up Claremont Avenue and over the hills at Claremont Canyon. Temescal was the site of agriculture, cattle grazing and greenhouses when, in the 1890s, an opera house was built in parkland north of the creek crossing at 51st street. The area grew and was developed into [[Idora Park]], the earliest \"trolley park\" in the East Bay. In 1929 the amusement park was closed and was razed in 1930. A plan to build mid-rise apartment blocks called the Midtown District fell through, and a tract of [[storybook houses]] was built on the site between 1930 and 1934. It is reported to be the first development in the American west with underground utilities.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, a wide wooden bridge spanned [[Temescal Creek (Northern California)|Temescal Creek]], carrying both road (Telegraph Avenue) and railroad tracks.\n\nThe [[horsecar]] line to the [[University of California]] along today's Telegraph Avenue (then called Humboldt Avenue in Oakland and Choate in Berkeley) operated out of a horse barn at 51st and Telegraph. When the horsecar was replaced by electric [[streetcar]]s, the horse barn was replaced by a carbarn. The carbarn became the Western Carhouse of the [[Key System]]'s streetcar division, the East Bay Street Railways. When the streetcars ceased operation in 1948, the car barn was remodeled to become ''Vern's'' market. Vern's closed in the 1970s and the building sat vacant for years. Eventually it was demolished and replaced by a strip mall, including a Walgreens store.\n\n[[Image:Temescal03102006.JPG|thumbnail|250px|right|The Kingfish Cafe and Pub, a popular bar in Temescal]]\n\n==Temescal Tool Lending Library==\nTemescal is home to one of the few tool-lending libraries in the Bay Area\u2014indeed, in the U.S. (The [[Berkeley Public Library]] also has a tool-lending library at their nearby South Branch.) The Temescal branch of the [[Oakland Public Library]] operates this facility, which lends tools, free of charge, to library patrons for repairs and home-improvement projects. The Tool Lending Library also has instructional materials (books, videos, etc.) and gives \"how-to\" workshops.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/Branches/temtll.htm\n |title=Temescal Tool Lending Library\n |publisher=Oakland Public Library\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Temescal Street Cinema]]\n*[[Bus rapid transit]]\n*[[MacArthur (BART)]]\n*[[Oakland Technical High School]]\n*[[Oakland International High School]]\n*[[Piedmont Avenue, Oakland, California]]\n*[[Rockridge, Oakland, California]]\n*[[Idora Park]]\n*[[Lake Temescal]]\n\n==Publications==\n* '''''Temescal News & Views''''' (\"Published by Temescal Neighbors Together with the support of Temescal merchants\"); bimonthly newsletter.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{coord|37|50|14|N|122|15|44|W|region:US-CA_type:city|display=title}}\n*[http://www.temescaldistrict.org/ Temescal and Telegraph Avenue Business District]\n*[http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/Branches/tem.htm Temescal Branch Library]\n*[http://www.oaklandnet.com/government/council/coun_mem/brunner/index.html Oakland City Councilmember Dan Kalb], who represents Temescal\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130318101506/http://studiooneartcenter.wix.com/studio-one-art-center-website Studio One Art Center]\n\n{{Oakland, California neighborhoods}}\n\n[[Category:African culture in California]]\n[[Category:Eritrean American]]\n[[Category:Ethiopian-American history]]\n[[Category:Italian-American culture in California]]\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in Oakland, California]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2016}}\n{{lead too short|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Temescal\n|other_name               =\n|native_name              = <!-- for cities whose native name is not in English -->\n|nickname                 =\n|motto                    =\n|image_skyline            = \n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = \n|image_flag               =\n|flag_size                =\n|image_seal               =\n|seal_size                =\n|image_shield             =\n|shield_size              =\n|image_blank_emblem       = \n|blank_emblem_size        = \n|image_map                = Oakland temescal locator map.png\n|mapsize                  = \n|map_caption              = Location of Temescal in Oakland\n|image_map1               =\n|mapsize1                 =\n|map_caption1             =\n|pushpin_map              = \n|pushpin_label_position   = \n|pushpin_mapsize          =\n|pushpin_map_caption      = \n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[California]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in California|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]]\n|subdivision_type3        = [[List of municipalities in California|City]]\n|subdivision_name3        = [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]\n|subdivision_type4        =\n|subdivision_name4        =\n|government_type          =\n|established_title        =\n|established_date         =Settled in 1860s<ref name=legacies/>\n|established_title2       =\n|established_date2        =Annexed by Oakland in 1897<ref name=legacies/>\n|established_title3       =\n|established_date3        =\n|area_magnitude           =\n|area_total_km2           =\n|area_total_sq_mi         =\n|area_land_km2            =\n|area_land_sq_mi          =\n|area_water_km2           =\n|area_water_sq_mi         =\n|area_water_percent       =\n|area_urban_km2           =\n|area_urban_sq_mi         =\n|area_metro_km2           =\n|area_metro_sq_mi         =\n|population_as_of         =\n|population_note          =\n|population_footnotes     =\n|settlement_type          = [[:Category:Neighborhoods in Oakland, California|Neighborhood of Oakland]]\n|population_total         = \n|population_density_km2   =\n|population_density_sq_mi =\n|population_metro         =\n|population_density_metro_km2     =\n|population_density_metro_sq_mi   =\n|population_urban                 =\n|population_density_urban_km2     =\n|population_density_urban_sq_mi   =\n|timezone                 = \n|utc_offset               = \n|timezone_DST             = \n|utc_offset_DST           = \n|coordinates              = {{coord|37.837222|-122.262222|region:US-CA|display=inline}}\n|elevation_m              = \n|elevation_ft             = \n|postal_code_type         = \n|postal_code              = \n|area_code                = \n|website                  =\n|blank_name               =\n|blank_info               =\n|blank1_name              = \n|blank1_info              =\n|footnotes                =\n}}\n'''Temescal''' is one of the oldest [[neighborhood]]s in [[Oakland, California]], located in [[North Oakland, Oakland, California|North Oakland]], and centered on [[Telegraph Avenue]].

Temescal is a diverse neighborhood with concentrations of [[Ethiopian American|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Americans|Eritrean]] [[immigrants]].\n\n==Public life==\nThe commercial heart of Temescal is Telegraph Avenue, between the [[MacArthur station (BART)|MacArthur BART Station]] and 51st Street. This area is known locally as the home to popular restaurants, such as Tara's Organic Ice Cream,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tarasorganic.com|title=Tara's Organic Ice Cream {{!}} Voted East Bay's 'Best Ice Cream Flavors'|last=MA|first=Bree Smith, eBree Web Design, Cambridge|website=www.tarasorganic.com|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> Lanesplitters, Pizzaiolo, Aunt Mary's,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.auntmaryscafe.com/|title=Aunt Mary's Cafe: Comfort with a Twist!|website=www.auntmaryscafe.com|access-date=2018-02-16}}</ref> Bakesale Betty,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bakesalebetty.com/locations.php | title=Pagina principal| date=2018-08-06}}</ref> \nand Burma Superstar.\n\nAnother commercial zone runs along 40th St, between Broadway and Telegraph. This area includes a mixture of food service and retail. Restaurants along this stretch of 40th ave include Magpie serving gourmet pizza alongside 39 taps of craft beer, cider & wine, Bierhaus with a great selection of about a dozen German beers and bites, Homeroom mac-n-cheese, Subrosa Coffee, Oakland Yard Wine Bar and Tacos Oscar.\n\nThere are many Ethiopian restaurants here, especially on Telegraph north of 51st St. There are also many Korean establishments along Telegraph Ave. Temescal Farmers' Market, begun in 2006, is held on Sundays in the parking lot of the Department of Motor Vehicles facility on Claremont Ave.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061012203716/http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/2006/08/temescal-farmers-market-oakland.jsp]</ref> Mama's Royal Cafe, locally famous for breakfast, and Clove & Hoof are located on Broadway, near the border of Temescal and the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood.\n\nStudio One, located on 45th Street, is home to art classes and workshops. [[Omni Commons|Counter Culture Labs]] is a public laboratory and [[hackerspace]] located in the Temescal neighborhood. Royal Nonesuch Gallery is an artist run art and event space located on Telegraph and 43rd. Temescal Pool, located next door, is open to the public. The neighborhood is also home to several public and private schools, including Park Day School and the architectural landmark Oakland Technical High School on Broadway.\n\n==History==\nTemescal was originally a separate village that had built up around the estate of Vicente Peralta, which was located near the modern intersections of [[Telegraph Avenue]] and Claremont Boulevard.<ref name=legacies>{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Jeff|title=Temescal legacies : narratives of change from a North Oakland neighborhood|year=2006|publisher=Shared Ground|location=Oakland, Calif.|isbn=9780977889303}}</ref> (Vicente's estate was part of the larger [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Peralta Grant]] that spanned 44,800 acres of land in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay.]]) In 1897, the residents of Temescal voted to join the City of Oakland in an effort to gain access to higher quality public schools and police services.<ref name=legacies/><ref name=sfgate/> At the time that the City of Oakland annexed Temescal, Temescal was considered to consist of all land north of 36th Street (the northern bound of the City of Oakland at the time) between the Emeryville city limit to the west and Broadway to the east.<ref name=legacies/>\n\nThe word ''temescal'' derives from the word ''temescalli'', which means \"sweat house\" in the [[Nahuatl]] language of the [[Mexica]] (\"Aztec\") people of [[Mexico]]. It is surmised that the Peraltas or perhaps one of their ranch hands ([[cowboy|vaquero]]s) had seen local indigenous ([[Ohlone]]) structures along the creek similar to those in other parts of [[New Spain]] which were called ''temescalli''.\n\nTemescal has long been an important junction of several principal thoroughfares: Telegraph, Claremont, and [[Shattuck Avenue]]s, and 51st Street.[[Image:Temescalpool.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Temescal Pool on 45th St. in Oakland]]\n\nThe earliest telegraph wire from Oakland to Sacramento went through the area, up Claremont Avenue and over the hills at Claremont Canyon. Temescal was the site of agriculture, cattle grazing and greenhouses when, in the 1890s, an opera house was built in parkland north of the creek crossing at 51st street. The area grew and was developed into [[Idora Park]], the earliest \"trolley park\" in the East Bay. In 1929 the amusement park was closed and was razed in 1930. A plan to build mid-rise apartment blocks called the Midtown District fell through, and a tract of [[storybook houses]] was built on the site between 1930 and 1934. It is reported to be the first development in the American west with underground utilities.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, a wide wooden bridge spanned [[Temescal Creek (Northern California)|Temescal Creek]], carrying both road (Telegraph Avenue) and railroad tracks.\n\nThe [[horsecar]] line to the [[University of California]] along today's Telegraph Avenue (then called Humboldt Avenue in Oakland and Choate in Berkeley) operated out of a horse barn at 51st and Telegraph. When the horsecar was replaced by electric [[streetcar]]s, the horse barn was replaced by a carbarn. The carbarn became the Western Carhouse of the [[Key System]]'s streetcar division, the East Bay Street Railways. When the streetcars ceased operation in 1948, the car barn was remodeled to become ''Vern's'' market. Vern's closed in the 1970s and the building sat vacant for years. Eventually it was demolished and replaced by a strip mall, including a Walgreens store.\n\n[[Image:Temescal03102006.JPG|thumbnail|250px|right|The Kingfish Cafe and Pub, a popular bar in Temescal]]\n\n==Temescal Tool Lending Library==\nTemescal is home to one of the few tool-lending libraries in the Bay Area\u2014indeed, in the U.S. (The [[Berkeley Public Library]] also has a tool-lending library at their nearby South Branch.) The Temescal branch of the [[Oakland Public Library]] operates this facility, which lends tools, free of charge, to library patrons for repairs and home-improvement projects. The Tool Lending Library also has instructional materials (books, videos, etc.) and gives \"how-to\" workshops.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/Branches/temtll.htm\n |title=Temescal Tool Lending Library\n |publisher=Oakland Public Library\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Temescal Street Cinema]]\n*[[Bus rapid transit]]\n*[[MacArthur (BART)]]\n*[[Oakland Technical High School]]\n*[[Oakland International High School]]\n*[[Piedmont Avenue, Oakland, California]]\n*[[Rockridge, Oakland, California]]\n*[[Idora Park]]\n*[[Lake Temescal]]\n\n==Publications==\n* '''''Temescal News & Views''''' (\"Published by Temescal Neighbors Together with the support of Temescal merchants\"); bimonthly newsletter.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{coord|37|50|14|N|122|15|44|W|region:US-CA_type:city|display=title}}\n*[http://www.temescaldistrict.org/ Temescal and Telegraph Avenue Business District]\n*[http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/Branches/tem.htm Temescal Branch Library]\n*[http://www.oaklandnet.com/government/council/coun_mem/brunner/index.html Oakland City Councilmember Dan Kalb], who represents Temescal\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130318101506/http://studiooneartcenter.wix.com/studio-one-art-center-website Studio One Art Center]\n\n{{Oakland, California neighborhoods}}\n\n[[Category:African culture in California]]\n[[Category:Eritrean American]]\n[[Category:Ethiopian-American history]]\n[[Category:Italian-American culture in California]]\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in Oakland, California]]\n", "name_user": "Virgil2015", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePublic life:Updating restaurant list to remove closed places and add newer ones.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temescal,_Oakland,_California"}

Rector]] depicting the 1897 [[boxing]] match between [[James J. Corbett]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] in [[Carson City, Nevada]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]]. Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the [[Feature length|longest]] film released to date; as such, it was the world's first [[feature film]]. The technology that allowed this is known as the [[Latham loop]]. Rector claimed to have invented the device, but its invention is disputed. He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm [[nitrate film]].  Only fragments of the film survive.  The known fragments were transferred in the 1980s from a print owned by Jean A. LeRoy of New York City, the transfer done on a specially built [[optical printer]] to convert the film to [[35mm movie film|35mm film]].\n\nThe film was also the first to be shot in [[widescreen]], with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of about 1.65:1. According to Dan Streible, ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'' is \"one of the earliest individual productions to sustain public commentary on the cinema.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\">{{cite book |last= Streible|first= Dan|date= 1997|title= Out of Bounds: Sports, Media, and the Politics of Identity|chapter= Female Spectators and the Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MhMLbP9N-7YC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Bloomington, Indiana|publisher= Indiana University Press|pages= 16\u201347|isbn= 0-253-33228-1|editor1-last= Baker|editor1-first= Aaron|editor2-last= Boyd|editor2-first= Todd Edward}}</ref> The film is so important to [[film history]] that Luke McKernan declared, \"it was boxing that created the cinema.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= McKernan|first= Luke|date= 1996|title= Cinema: The Beginnings and the Future|chapter= Sport and the First Films|location= London|publisher= University of Westminister Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/cinemabeginnings0000unse/page/107 107]|isbn= 1859190073|editor-last= Williams|editor-first= Christopher|url= https://archive.org/details/cinemabeginnings0000unse/page/107}}</ref> As noted by Seth Abraham, the president of ''[[Time Warner Sports]]'', it was the first motion picture to ever depict the championship prizefight.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000023042674&view=1up&seq=77 Statement of Seth G.

This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction.  What made this film exceptional is a five-minute introduction that showed former champion [[John L. Sullivan]] (whom Corbett defeated in 1892) and his manager, [[Billy Madden]], introducing the event, the introduction of referee [[George Siler]], and both boxers entering the ring in their robes.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\nThe one-minute rests between each round were captured on film and when it was reissued it included a ten-minute epilogue of the empty ring at the end of the fight, into which members of the audience eventually stormed. Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes.  The film climaxes with Fitzsimmons hitting Corbett in the [[solar plexus]] for a knockout and Corbett crawling outside the space of the camera so that he is not visible above the waist.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\n==Production==\nEnoch J. Rector had been an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company, which filmed ''[[Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph]]'' (1894) in six one minute rounds, each exhibited via the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[Kinetoscope]] as a separate [[peep box|peep show]] for a separate fee.<ref name= \"Musser1990\">{{cite book |last= Musser|first= Charles|date= 1990|title= The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEUMWToGOtUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 0-520-08533-7|author-link= Charles Musser}}</ref>{{rp|194}} Some time after leaving the company, Rector arranged for the film with boxing promoter [[Dan Stuart (promoter)|Dan Stuart]].<ref name= \"Condon2009\">{{cite book |last= Condon|first= Dennis|date= 2009|chapter= Irish Audiences Watch Their First US Feature: The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (1897)|title= Screening Irish-America: A Reader|location= Dublin|publisher= Irish Academic Press|pages= 135\u2013147|isbn= 9780716529910|editor-last= Barton|editor-first= Ruth}}</ref>{{rp|137}} Stuart offered $10,000 to the winner of the bout in an agreement signed by both boxers on 4 January 1897.

He concludes that prizefighting, as opposed to [[physical culture]], was not associated with aesthetics or male beauty, Corbett excepted.  The aesthetics of the boxing scene were better known for broken jaws and [[cauliflower ears]], such that one's [[sexual orientation]] probably had little bearing on one's appreciation of the film, and of a sport surrounded by [[homophobic]] press.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|41}}\n\nMusser, in his discussion of subsequent feature-length fight films, that subsequent to ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'', no boxing film drew comparable audience numbers and that women stopped attending in significant numbers.,<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|208}} reinforcing Streible's theories of hype and female interest in Corbett the matinee idol.\n\nDenis Condon discusses how class, rather than gender, affected audience response to the film in Dublin.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" /> The significance of the film's reception in Ireland derives from the fact that Corbett was Irish by birth and often contrasted to the English-born Fitzsimmons, who himself was the son of an Irish blacksmith, a fact that no newspaper noted at the time.  He notes a surprising absence, in response to the film, of ethnic partisanship, in spite of the St. Patrick's Day day of the fight, the Irish-English tension of 1898, and heavy antagonism of the Irish-American Corbett and the English Fitzsimmons, who is elsewhere described as Anglo-Australian.  Audiences put aside political fervors and suspended their knowledge, pretending that they were watching a live performance.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|144}} Irish women did not attend, possibly because [[The Lyric Hall]], where the film was shown, often featured live boxing and sexually risqu\u00e9 material, and thus considered an inappropriate place for a respectable woman, while another theatre nearby was regarded as more family-friendly.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|141}}\n\n==Legacy==\nQuick to compete, [[Siegmund Lubin]] created a film the same year known as ''[[Reproduction of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', staged on a rooftop with two freight handlers from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

The Arkansas Vitascope Company showed the film.

Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the [[Feature length|longest]] film released to date; as such, it was the world's first [[feature film]]. The technology that allowed this is known as the [[Latham loop]]. Rector claimed to have invented the device, but its invention is disputed. He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm [[nitrate film]].  Only fragments of the film survive.

Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes.

Much attention was given to the fact that Rose Julian Fitzsimmons, Bob's wife, viewed the live match from a box with other female companions, such as dancers [[Lo\u00efe Eiler]] and [[Ida Eiler]], while women otherwise did not mix with the crowd.  As much as 60% of the Chicago audience was composed of women.<ref name= \"Musser1990\" /> As [[Miriam Hansen]] put it, \"it afforded women the forbidden sight of male bodies in seminudity, engaged in intimate and intense physical action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Hansen|first= Miriam|date= 1991|title= Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8nFG8zMWI-0C&lpg=PA1&dq=Miriam%20Hansen%20The%20Corbett-Fitzsimmons%20Fight&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Cambridge|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-05831-3}}</ref> She argues a connection between the female reception of this film and the large female audience for [[Rudolph Valentino]] two decades later, who was typically shown stripped to the waist and beaten in his films.\n\nStreible calls this into debate, and suggests that the size of the female audience is predominantly self-generated [[Boilerplate text|boilerplate]].  The film had been strongly opposed by the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], which tried to get legislation passed to prevent the film's transmission by mail.<ref>''Congressional Record'' XXIX pp. 2581\u201389</ref>  Their protests of fight films were second only to suffrage on their national agenda.<ref>''23rd Annual Meeting of the Women's Christian Temperance Union'', 11</ref><ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|30}} Several state and local authorities tried to ban the reproduction of pugilist films, but this did not come to a vote.<ref>''New York Tribune'', March 25, 1897</ref><ref>''New York Tribune'', April 16, 1897</ref><ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}  An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared, \"It is not very creditable to our civilization perhaps that an achievement of what is now called the 'veriscope' that has attracted and will attract the widest attention should be the representation of a prizefight.\"<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', May 26, 1897</ref> Rector claimed that the film had \"every defect known to photography\" in the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' in attempt to quell the protests against a film falsely deemed unusable.<ref>[[San Francisco Examiner]], April 14, 1897, p. 1</ref><ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|24}} Because the audience for prizefighting was \"perceived to be a rowdy, less desirable class of patron[,] Veriscope recruited more genteel audiences.

Vincent]] called ''[[Gentleman Jack (play)|Gentleman Jack]]'', which contributed to Corbett's reputation as a [[matinee idol]] for women, as the play was presented to mixed audiences. Brady had honed Corbett's image as an educated gentleman in order to improve his appeal to [[bourgeois]] audiences.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Woods|first= Alan|date= 1976|title= James J.

One of these was by \"Matinee Girl,\" a reporter for the ''[[New York Dramatic Mirror]]'' (who may or may not have been a real woman), who reported in the June 12, 1897 issue viewing the film with some shame, admiration for Corbett, and disappointment at his loss.  He points out that she name-drops Brady, which identifies her as an \"insider.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|34}} The other article he found by a woman was \"Alice Rix at the Veriscope\" from the ''Examiner'' Sunday Magazine.<ref>''Examiner'', July 18, 1897, p. 72</ref>  [[Alice Rix]], known for a particular brand of \"[[sob sister]]\" journalism (along with [[Nellie Bly]] and [[Dorothy Dix]]), claimed that when she viewed the film at the [[Olympia Theatre, New York|Olympia Theatre]], she counted only sixty women in an audience of a thousand, and found the [[dress circle]] empty.  She observed that they were mostly \"dressed down,\" and that all were escorted by men and appeared uninterestedly watching a bloodless spectacle.  She proceeded to describe the entire medium of motion pictures as \"awful.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|36\u201337}}\n\nStreible reproduces a drawing that accompanied Rix's article depicting two women in attendance of the film. One appears to be younger and leaning forward, watching the film with interest, while the other, apparently an older woman acting as chaperon, is turned away from the screen and uninterested in the film, even dismayed at the younger woman's interest. He notes that \"respectable women\" had been allowed to attend theater for only about a generation, and that Broadway did not actively court women or families as audience members until 1865.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|38}} The pre-war audience had primarily been men and prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book |last= Allen|first= Robert C.|date= 1991|title= Horrible Prettiness:  Burlesque and American Culture|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4IoXcZyKKJoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Chapel Hill|publisher= The University of North Carolina Press|page= 86|isbn= 0-8078-4316-4|author-link= Robert C. Allen}}</ref><ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|33}} By 1897, women were only beginning to see theater as a legitimate social space. Musser notes that ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' went so far as to call the film the \"proper\" thing for ladies to see.<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|200}} Streible, citing the research of [[Antonia Lant]], contrasts paintings of women in theater audiences by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Claude Monet]], and [[Berthe Morisot]] with this drawing by making it appear that the fact that women were allowed to look was more important than that the act of looking being allowed to them.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|46}} That the younger woman is leaning indicates that what she is looking at is, in fact, what is important to her rather than the simple privilege of looking.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|39}}\n\nStreible also touches on potential [[homoerotic]] interest in the film, citing work on [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] photos by [[Thomas Waugh]].  He concludes that prizefighting, as opposed to [[physical culture]], was not associated with aesthetics or male beauty, Corbett excepted.  The aesthetics of the boxing scene were better known for broken jaws and [[cauliflower ears]], such that one's [[sexual orientation]] probably had little bearing on one's appreciation of the film, and of a sport surrounded by [[homophobic]] press.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|41}}\n\nMusser, in his discussion of subsequent feature-length fight films, that subsequent to ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'', no boxing film drew comparable audience numbers and that women stopped attending in significant numbers.,<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|208}} reinforcing Streible's theories of hype and female interest in Corbett the matinee idol.\n\nDenis Condon discusses how class, rather than gender, affected audience response to the film in Dublin.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" /> The significance of the film's reception in Ireland derives from the fact that Corbett was Irish by birth and often contrasted to the English-born Fitzsimmons, who himself was the son of an Irish blacksmith, a fact that no newspaper noted at the time.  He notes a surprising absence, in response to the film, of ethnic partisanship, in spite of the St. Patrick's Day day of the fight, the Irish-English tension of 1898, and heavy antagonism of the Irish-American Corbett and the English Fitzsimmons, who is elsewhere described as Anglo-Australian.  Audiences put aside political fervors and suspended their knowledge, pretending that they were watching a live performance.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|144}} Irish women did not attend, possibly because [[The Lyric Hall]], where the film was shown, often featured live boxing and sexually risqu\u00e9 material, and thus considered an inappropriate place for a respectable woman, while another theatre nearby was regarded as more family-friendly.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|141}}\n\n==Legacy==\nQuick to compete, [[Siegmund Lubin]] created a film the same year known as ''[[Reproduction of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', staged on a rooftop with two freight handlers from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].  Each round was shot on only 50 feet of 35 millimeter film stock at a very slow speed.  Veriscope threatened to sue, but there was no law broken.<ref name= \"Ramsaye1964\" />{{rp|288}} Audiences did not appreciate the facsimile, even though it was advertised as such.  The Arkansas Vitascope Company showed the film.  The June 1897 issue of ''[[Phonoscope]]'' reprinted an article from ''[[The Little Rock Gazette]]'' that stated that the audience was so angered by Lubin's film that it was turned off after the third round for lack of an audience.<ref>''[[Phonoscope]]'', June 1897, p. 12</ref> The August\u2013September issue of ''Phonoscope'' noted that the manager of the opera house turned over his $253 profits to a state senator who, after time to deliberate, eventually refunded the patrons' money.<ref>''[[Phonoscope]]'', August/September 1897, p. 8</ref>\n\nRamsaye notes that ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'' was the singular film that pushed the social status of film, then uncertain, into the [[Low culture|low-brow]].<ref name= \"Ramsaye1964\" />{{rp|289}} This is not consistent with the way that the film was actually marketed.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Prices for seats were set up to $1 for the wealthiest patrons, assuring middle and upper class attendance.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|26}}\n\nRector intended to go into long form dramatic films, but was dismissed as a crank, although he continued to be involved in the technical side of motion picture production.<ref name= \"Ramsaye1964\" />{{rp|288\u2013289}}\n\nThe Corbett Dollar [[United States commemorative coins|commemorative coin]] was issued, which is now very rare, made from brass, with Corbett's bust facing right with 13 stars around it on the obverse, and wreath of leaves and berries, tied to a bottom with ribbon \"For the Championship of the World.
