The law came into effect on 22 January 2003 when it was published in the [[Government Gazette of South Africa]] number 28075.  \n\n==Scope==\nRICA regulates the interception of communications, the monitoring of radio signals and radio frequency spectrums and the provision of communication-related information &ndash; information relating to indirect communication in the records of [[telecommunication]] service providers. \nIt also regulates applications for interception of communications and provision of communication-related information under certain circumstances. It regulates law enforcement where interception of communications  is involved and prohibits the provision of telecommunication services which do not have the capability to be intercepted and requires telecommunication service providers to store communication-related information (CRI). The law specifies costs to be borne by telecommunication service providers related to these requirements and compensation to services providers. It provides for the establishment of interception centres an Office for Interception Centres and an Internet Service Providers Assistance Fund. Lastly it prohibits the manufacturing, assembling, possessing, selling, purchasing or advertising of interception equipment without a certificate of exemption issued by the relevant Minister.\n\n==Structure==\nRICA is not limited to the provisions contained in the Act itself, but is supplemented by a directive, a notice, a schedule and four proclamations. The directive prescribed the technical and security requirements related to the interception and routing of communications and the recordal and storage of CRI. Schedule A of the Directive applies to fixed line telecommunications operators and Schedule B and C applies to mobile cellular providers and Internet service providers respectively. The various types of listed equipment is detailed in the notice while the Schedule lists serious crimes that justify interception. Finally the four proclamations deal with the enforcement dates of the Act. Since its promulgation RICA has been amended four times. Two of these amendments are already in force and two are pending. \n\n==Constitutional Conflict==\n{{Original research|date=May 2012}}\n\nSection 14 of the Bill of Rights in the South African Constitution of 1996<ref name=\"constitution\">[https://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/Constitution-Republic-South-Africa-1996-1 The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]</ref> expressly provides that \"everyone has a right to privacy, which includes the right not to have (...) (d) the privacy of their communications infringed\". The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited, section 36 of the Constitution. However, various other provisions in the Bill of Rights indirectly imply a right to safety and security. If citizens have a right to security, it creates a corresponding duty on the State. Chapter 11 of the Constitution governs this duty and authorise the Police, Defence Force and Intelligence Agencies to assist the State in its security obligations. Parliament therefore attempted to balance these two conflicting rights by providing for judicial oversight and limiting interception only to those cases where a serious crime is involved.\n\n==Duties and Prohibitions==\nRICA provides for three main types of provisions - duties, prohibitions and procedures. The duties are directed at enabling interception, while the prohibitions are aimed at enforcing the individuals privacy right. \n\n==Equality==\nIt is, however, neither privacy nor security that raise the most objections against RICA, but equality concerns. A recent proposed amendment to section 40 provides for preferential treatment of mobile providers by extending the enforcement of cell phone registration indefinitely.\n\n==Technological neutrality==\nDifferent communications tools and technologies are also not subject to equal treatment in RICA. An email, for example is not subject to the onerous duty that related data (like the time, date, sender and recipient of the email) should be recorded and stored while such duties apply to all telephone and cellular communications.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[Interception of Communications Bill 2006]]\n* [[Mass Surveillance]]\n\n\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.internet.org.za/ricpci.html#interceptionofcommunicationunderinterceptiondirection The English text of the law]\n* [http://www.ioljobs.co.za/article_view.php?fArticleId=3138373 Watch that email content - it could get you fired] in the [[Cape Argus]]\n\n[[Category:Privacy of telecommunications]]\n[[Category:Communications in South Africa]]\n[[Category:South African legislation]]\n[[Category:2002 in South African law]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|RICA}}\nThe '''Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act''' (RICA)<ref name=\"rica\">[https://www.gov.za/documents/regulation-interception-communications-and-provision-communication-related-information--13]</ref> is a [[South Africa]]n [[law]] that regulates the interception of communications and associated processes such as applications for and authorisation of interception of communications.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US. It was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling album by a solo artist of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift is set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, beginning on June 20, 2020.\n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. The album appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019.\n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> At midnight, she released the album's lead single, \"[[Me!]]\" featuring [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]], along with its accompanying music video.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> Swift encouraged fans to find hints about the album title in the video and many fans pointed out that at one point in the video, the word \"Lover\" appeared on a neon light up sign at the top of a building in the background.<ref>{{cite web |last=Walsh |first=Savannah |title=Taylor Swift's New Album Title Hint Suggests That Apparently Fans May Already Know It |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |website=Bustle |accessdate=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621150341/https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2019, she confirmed the album title in a live stream on Instagram, and that the album would be released on August 23, 2019.<ref name=\"release\">{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|first=Raisa|last=Bruner|title=Taylor Swift Just Announced the Summer Release Date for Her New Album Lover and Next Song|date=June 13, 2019|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=June 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613235726/https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift also announced that the album's second single, \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\", would be released the next day on June 14, followed by its music video three days later.<ref name=\"billboardpop\">{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Katie |title=Taylor Swift Announces New Song 'You Need to Calm Down' & 'Lover' Album Release Date |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |website=Billboard |date=June 13, 2019 |accessdate=June 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614004337/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |archive-date=June 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> She described the album as a romantic one, stating that it was \"not just simply thematically, like it's all love songs or something.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US.

Prior to this, Ukraine had not renewed the lease of Black Sea Naval base at Sevastopol, meaning that Russian troops would have to leave Crimea by 2017.

It was noticed that between 25 August 2003 and 7 November 2014 there was 0.6 medals ''For Distinction in Combat'' awarded to Russian servicemen per day. However, between 7 November 2014 and 18 February 2016 there was an average of 9.3 medals awarded per day, over a fifteenfold increase. Moreover, the award dates directly coincide with major conflicts occurring in Ukraine at the time. August 2014 sees an initial spike of 60 medal per day being awarded, which coincides with reports of regular Russian troops crossing into Ukraine to aid separatist forces. The medal awards peak during November and December 2014, at over 70 per day, which was a crucial turning point during the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]], continuing to remain at over 10 medals per day until March 2015, which coincides with the [[Battle of Debaltseve]]. Also important to note is that the medal ''For Distinction in Combat'' may only be awarded for activities undertaken during a combat mission, therefore the large spike in medals awarded in late 2014 and early 2015 suggests a large contingent of Russian servicemen undertaking combat missions. In all 4300 medals were awarded between 7 July 2014 and 18 February 2016, suggesting combat operations involving active duty Russian military personnel occurred during the time period. Likewise spikes in awarding other medals were seen as well. The medal ''For Courage'' which was awarded at a rate of 1.4 medals per day between September 2008 and August 2014 increased to 6.3 medals per day between August 2014 and November 2015. The ''[[Medal of Suvorov]]'' saw an increase of award rate from 1.5 medals per day between October 2013 and November 2014 to 6.8 medals per day after November 2014.

Prior to this, Ukraine had not renewed the lease of Black Sea Naval base at Sevastopol, meaning that Russian troops would have to leave Crimea by 2017.

He insisted that, contrary to international law, if Ukraine signed the agreement, from a legal point of view, the Ukrainian government would violate the bilateral treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia that delineates the countries' borders.

It was noticed that between 25 August 2003 and 7 November 2014 there was 0.6 medals ''For Distinction in Combat'' awarded to Russian servicemen per day. However, between 7 November 2014 and 18 February 2016 there was an average of 9.3 medals awarded per day, over a fifteenfold increase. Moreover, the award dates directly coincide with major conflicts occurring in Ukraine at the time. August 2014 sees an initial spike of 60 medal per day being awarded, which coincides with reports of regular Russian troops crossing into Ukraine to aid separatist forces. The medal awards peak during November and December 2014, at over 70 per day, which was a crucial turning point during the [[Second Battle of Donetsk Airport]], continuing to remain at over 10 medals per day until March 2015, which coincides with the [[Battle of Debaltseve]]. Also important to note is that the medal ''For Distinction in Combat'' may only be awarded for activities undertaken during a combat mission, therefore the large spike in medals awarded in late 2014 and early 2015 suggests a large contingent of Russian servicemen undertaking combat missions. In all 4300 medals were awarded between 7 July 2014 and 18 February 2016, suggesting combat operations involving active duty Russian military personnel occurred during the time period. Likewise spikes in awarding other medals were seen as well. The medal ''For Courage'' which was awarded at a rate of 1.4 medals per day between September 2008 and August 2014 increased to 6.3 medals per day between August 2014 and November 2015. The ''[[Medal of Suvorov]]'' saw an increase of award rate from 1.5 medals per day between October 2013 and November 2014 to 6.8 medals per day after November 2014.

They would not allow Mohan to settle there. He was a follower of [[Guru Hargobind]] Sahib and the Guru appealed on behalf of Mohan but to no avail. The result was an armed struggle and the Bhullars and Dhaliwals were defeated by the Guru's men, which allowed Mohan to establish the Village of Meharaj in 1627.<ref>''A History of Sikh Misals'', Dr Bhagat Singh</ref>\n\n====Battle of Mehraj====\nMohan Singh fought against the Mughals at the Battle of Mehraj 1631 on the side of Guru Hargobind Sahib.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Mohan Singh and his eldest son Rup Chand were later killed in a fight against the [[Bhatti]]'s (a tribe who also claim to be the descendants of [[Rawal Jaisal]] of [[Jaisalmer]], but also an enemy of the [[Phulkian]]s). Kala, Mohan's younger son succeeded the \"chaudriyat\", and was guardian to Rup Chand's sons Phul and Sandali.\n\n====Phul====\nWhen Kala Sidhu died, Phul formed his own village (Phul), five miles from Meharaj (under the blessings of Sikh Guru's) in 1663. [[Nabha]] and [[Jind]] trace their ancestry to the devout [[Sikh]] Phul. It was one of the first  Sikh Kingdoms of Punjab to be formed. Apparently the appellation of dynasty \"Phulkian\" is derived from their common founder. One of his sons, Chota Ram, was baptised and blessed by Guru [[Gobind Singh]]. His son Ala Singh assumed the leadership in 1714 when [[Banda Bahadur]] was engaged in the fierce battle against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. A man with vision and courage, Ala Singh's general, Gurbaksh Singh Kaleka, carved out an independent principality from a [[Zamindar]]i of 30 villages. Under his successors, it expanded into a large state, touching the [[Shivaliks]] in north, [[Rajasthan]] in the south and upper courses of the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] and [[Sutlej River|Sutlej]] rivers while confronting the most trying and challenging circumstances.\n\n===Baba Ala Singh===\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, Baba Ala Singh, unlike many of his contemporaries, displayed tremendous shrewdness in dealing with the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s and [[Afghan people|Afghans]], and successfully established a state which he had started building up from its nucleus [[Barnala]]. He became traitor to the Sikhs, who made him a Sardar from a peasant and fought on the side of Ahmad Shah Abdali against the Sikhs .\n\n===Qila Mubarak===\n[[File:PATIALA,QILLA MUBARAK.jpg|thumb|right|The main gate of the Qila Mubarak.]]\nIn 1763 Baba Ala Singh laid the foundation of the Patiala fort known as [[Qila Mubarak]], around which the present city of Patiala developed. After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 in which the [[Marathas]] were defeated, the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] bestowed upon Ala Singh furm and banner, and the title of [[Maharaja of Patiala]]. After his death, his grandson Amar Singh succeeded and received the title of Raja-I-Rajaan. He was also allowed to strike coins.\n\n===Treaty with the British===\nAfter forty years of ceaseless struggle with the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s and [[Afghanistan|Afghans]], the borders of the Patiala state witnessed the blazing trails of [[Ranjit Singh]] in the north and of the British in the east. Bestowed with the grit and instinct of survival, making self-preservation a priority  the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the British against Ranjit Singh in 1808, thus becoming collaborators in the [[British Empire|empire]] building process of the British in the sub-continent of [[India]]. The subsequent rulers of Patiala, such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]], Rajinder Singh, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]], and [[Yuvraj of Patiala|Yadvindra Singh]] were parties to a [[subsidiary alliance]] and were heavily influenced by the British, but retained the internal government of their state.\n\n===Maharaja Bhupinder Singh===\n[[File:Bhupendra Singh Patiala.jpg|right|thumb|[[Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] of Patiala]]\n[[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]], who reigned from 1900 to 1938, gave Patiala a prominent place on the political map of India and also in the field of international sports. In the game of [[Polo]], Patiala had the World's best Polo Back, General Chanda Singh, who later went on to play for England and Spain on the requests of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] and King Alfonso of Spain, winning both Kings a prestigious Polo Cup.  The Maharaja was also fond of dogs, and he and the [[Ranbir Singh of Jind|Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Jind]] were equally interested in a range of dog breeds. His son [[Maharaja]] [[Yadavindra Singh]] was the first Indian prince to sign the [[Instrument of Accession]] to the new [[Dominion of India|Union of India]], thus facilitating the process of national integration after the [[Partition of India]] and the departure of the British in August 1947. In recognition of his services, he was appointed as [[Rajpramukh]] of the newly established [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] (PEPSU), from its founding in 1948 until its merger with the [[Punjab, India|Punjab Province]] in 1956.

The former is [[Urdu]] for a \"strip of land\" and ''<nowiki/>'ala''<nowiki/>' comes from the name of the founder of the city and Patiala state, [[Ala Singh]], thus meaning \u2018the land of Ala Singh\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.totalpunjab.com/patiala/about-patiala/the-history-of-patiala/|title=The History of Patiala {{!}} Patiala|website=www.totalpunjab.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==Brief history==\n[[File:MotiBaghPalace.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moti Bagh Palace]], Patiala.]]\nThe office of Maharaja became hereditary among the descendants of Ala Singh until Phul, the Sikh ancestor of the dynasty, which came to rule over Patiala, Jind, and Nabha.\n\n===Early history===\nThe history of Patiala state starts off with the ancestor of the [[Sikh]] Patiala Royal House, Mohan Singh being harassed by neighbouring [[Bhullars|Bhullar]] and Dhaliwal farmers . They would not allow Mohan to settle there. He was a follower of [[Guru Hargobind]] Sahib and the Guru appealed on behalf of Mohan but to no avail. The result was an armed struggle and the Bhullars and Dhaliwals were defeated by the Guru's men, which allowed Mohan to establish the Village of Meharaj in 1627.<ref>''A History of Sikh Misals'', Dr Bhagat Singh</ref>\n\n====Battle of Mehraj====\nMohan Singh fought against the Mughals at the Battle of Mehraj 1631 on the side of Guru Hargobind Sahib.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Mohan Singh and his eldest son Rup Chand were later killed in a fight against the [[Bhatti]]'s (a tribe who also claim to be the descendants of [[Rawal Jaisal]] of [[Jaisalmer]], but also an enemy of the [[Phulkian]]s). Kala, Mohan's younger son succeeded the \"chaudriyat\", and was guardian to Rup Chand's sons Phul and Sandali.\n\n====Phul====\nWhen Kala Sidhu died, Phul formed his own village (Phul), five miles from Meharaj (under the blessings of Sikh Guru's) in 1663. [[Nabha]] and [[Jind]] trace their ancestry to the devout [[Sikh]] Phul. It was one of the first  Sikh Kingdoms of Punjab to be formed. Apparently the appellation of dynasty \"Phulkian\" is derived from their common founder. One of his sons, Chota Ram, was baptised and blessed by Guru [[Gobind Singh]]. His son Ala Singh assumed the leadership in 1714 when [[Banda Bahadur]] was engaged in the fierce battle against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. A man with vision and courage, Ala Singh's general, Gurbaksh Singh Kaleka, carved out an independent principality from a [[Zamindar]]i of 30 villages. Under his successors, it expanded into a large state, touching the [[Shivaliks]] in north, [[Rajasthan]] in the south and upper courses of the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] and [[Sutlej River|Sutlej]] rivers while confronting the most trying and challenging circumstances.\n\n===Baba Ala Singh===\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, Baba Ala Singh, unlike many of his contemporaries, displayed tremendous shrewdness in dealing with the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s and [[Afghan people|Afghans]], and successfully established a state which he had started building up from its nucleus [[Barnala]]. He became traitor to the Sikhs, who made him a Sardar from a peasant and fought on the side of Ahmad Shah Abdali against the Sikhs .\n\n===Qila Mubarak===\n[[File:PATIALA,QILLA MUBARAK.jpg|thumb|right|The main gate of the Qila Mubarak.]]\nIn 1763 Baba Ala Singh laid the foundation of the Patiala fort known as [[Qila Mubarak]], around which the present city of Patiala developed. After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 in which the [[Marathas]] were defeated, the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] bestowed upon Ala Singh furm and banner, and the title of [[Maharaja of Patiala]]. After his death, his grandson Amar Singh succeeded and received the title of Raja-I-Rajaan. He was also allowed to strike coins.\n\n===Treaty with the British===\nAfter forty years of ceaseless struggle with the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s and [[Afghanistan|Afghans]], the borders of the Patiala state witnessed the blazing trails of [[Ranjit Singh]] in the north and of the British in the east. Bestowed with the grit and instinct of survival, making self-preservation a priority  the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the British against Ranjit Singh in 1808, thus becoming collaborators in the [[British Empire|empire]] building process of the British in the sub-continent of [[India]]. The subsequent rulers of Patiala, such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]], Rajinder Singh, [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]], and [[Yuvraj of Patiala|Yadvindra Singh]] were parties to a [[subsidiary alliance]] and were heavily influenced by the British, but retained the internal government of their state.\n\n===Maharaja Bhupinder Singh===\n[[File:Bhupendra Singh Patiala.jpg|right|thumb|[[Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]] of Patiala]]\n[[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Bhupinder Singh]], who reigned from 1900 to 1938, gave Patiala a prominent place on the political map of India and also in the field of international sports. In the game of [[Polo]], Patiala had the World's best Polo Back, General Chanda Singh, who later went on to play for England and Spain on the requests of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] and King Alfonso of Spain, winning both Kings a prestigious Polo Cup.  The Maharaja was also fond of dogs, and he and the [[Ranbir Singh of Jind|Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Jind]] were equally interested in a range of dog breeds. His son [[Maharaja]] [[Yadavindra Singh]] was the first Indian prince to sign the [[Instrument of Accession]] to the new [[Dominion of India|Union of India]], thus facilitating the process of national integration after the [[Partition of India]] and the departure of the British in August 1947. In recognition of his services, he was appointed as [[Rajpramukh]] of the newly established [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] (PEPSU), from its founding in 1948 until its merger with the [[Punjab, India|Punjab Province]] in 1956. The downtown area of Patiala is called ''Adalat Bazaar'', which means 'the court corridor', because this was used as the administrative building by one of the caretaker rulers, before Maharaja Bhupinder Singh had reached the [[age of majority]]. [[Rajmata Mohinder Kaur of Patiala|Rajmata Mohinder Kaur]] was the oldest member of the family till 2017, and the present head is [[Amarinder Singh]], current chief minister of [[Punjab]].\n\n===Rulers===\n[[File:Mahendra Singh of Patiala.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Maharaja Mahendra Singh of Patiala]].]]\n[[File:Portrait of Sir Rajinder Singh Maharaja of Patiala.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rajinder Singh|Maharaja Rajinder Singh]] of Patiala]]\nThe rulers of Patiala bore the title '[[Maharaja]]-e Rajgan' from 1810 onward.<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_K-W.html Princely states of India]</ref>\n\n====Maharajas====\n*29 Mar 1761 \u2013 22 August 1765: Ala Singh (b. 1691 \u2013 d. 1765)\n*22 Aug 1765 \u2013 1767: Amar Singh (b. 1748 \u2013 d. 1781)\n\n====Raja-e Rajgan====\n*1767 \u2013 5 February 1781: Amar Singh (s.a.)\n*Feb 1781 \u2013 1810: Sahib Singh (b. 1774 \u2013 d. 1813)\n\n====Maharaja-e Rajgan====\n*1810 \u2013 26 March 1813: Sahib Singh (s. a.)\n*26 Mar 1813 \u2013 23 December 1845: Karam Singh (b. 1797 \u2013 d. 1845)\n**26 Mar 1813 \u2013 1823: Maharani Aus Kaur (f) \u2013 Regent (b. 1772 \u2013 d. af.1823)\n*23 Dec 1845 \u2013 13 November 1862: Narendra Singh (b. 1823 \u2013 d. 1862) (from 25 June 1861 Sir Narendra Singh)\n*13 Nov 1862 \u2013 14 April 1876: [[Mahendra Singh of Patiala|Mahendra Singh]]  (b. 1852 \u2013 d. 1876) (from 28 May 1870 Sir Mahendra Singh)\n**13 Nov 1862 \u2013 26 February 1870: Jagdish Singh (Regent, chairman of regency council)\n*14 Apr 1876 \u2013 9 November 1900: [[Rajinder Singh]] (b. 1872 \u2013 d. 1900) (from 21 May 1898 Sir Rajendra Singh)\n**14 April 1876 \u2013 Oct 1890: Sir Deva Singh (Regent) (b. 1834 \u2013 d. 1890) (chairman of regency council)\n*9 November 1900 \u2013 23 March 1938:  [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Bhupinder Singh]]  (b. 1891 \u2013 d. 1938) (from 12 December 1911 Sir Bhupindra Singh)\n**9 November 1900 \u2013 3 November 1910: Sardar Gurmukh Singh \u2013 (Regent, chairman of regency council)\n*23 Mar 1938 \u2013 15 August 1947: [[Yadavindra Singh]]  (b. 1913 \u2013 d. 1974) (from 1 January 1942 Sir Yadavindra Singh)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Maharaja of Patiala]]\n*[[Patiala State Monorail Trainways]]\n* [[Political integration of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Princely states of India}}\n{{Princely states of the Punjab and Simla Hills}}\n{{coord|31|07|N|77|38|E|region:IN_type:landmark_source:kolossus-svwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Princely states of Punjab]]\n[[Category:Patiala]]\n[[Category:History of Punjab, India]]\n[[Category:1627 establishments in India]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEtymology:spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patiala_State"}
