Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to three per week. She featured most often with the characters [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995.\n\nExecutive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nNatalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]) in [[Walford]], but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter [[List of EastEnders characters (1999)#Susie Price|Susie]] (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.\n\nAt age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993.\n\n===1994\u20132004===\nMischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her.\n\nWhen Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nIn 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self-confident business woman, running a dating agency. [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \"Romantic Relations\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after.\n[[File:Natalie Barry Evans EE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] and Natalie marry (1999)|170px]]\n\nDespite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on [[New Year's Eve]] in 1999, in a joint wedding with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]). They live with Barry's father [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and stepmother [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son [[Jack Evans (EastEnders)|Jack]] (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002\u2014the birth is traumatic as Jack was [[breech birth|born feet first]]. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, [[Nathan Williams (EastEnders)|Nathan Williams]] ([[Doug Allen (actor)|Doug Allen]]), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.\n\nFeeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave [[Albert Square]] with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by [[Paul Trueman]] ([[Gary Beadle]]), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, the day after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in [[Scotland]]. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing.\n\nSuspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\n1994 was a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]).

On-screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca.

In an interview with the \u2018\u2019Walford Gazette\u2019\u2019, Speed commented: \u201cI was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me\u2026But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on\u2026they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them\u2026I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!\u201d<ref name=\"wg\"/>\n\n===Reintroduction and marriage to Barry Evans===\nAfter a four-year absence, Lucy Speed decided that she wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate [[Ross Kemp]], who played [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]]. Robinson had been thinking of introducing a new love-interest for the character [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie.

He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender, identified via discussion of the friendship between Bianca and Natalie. Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"[Natalie] can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\nLinda Ruth Williams, author of ''The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema'', was critical of a scene featuring Natalie speaking in a derogatory manner about the [[erotic thriller]] film genre.

Natalie retorted that \"pinning me up against the erotic thriller section\" was not her idea of a romantic setting for sex.

Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to three per week. She featured most often with the characters [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995.\n\nExecutive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nNatalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]) in [[Walford]], but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter [[List of EastEnders characters (1999)#Susie Price|Susie]] (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.\n\nAt age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993.\n\n===1994\u20132004===\nMischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her.\n\nWhen Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nIn 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self-confident business woman, running a dating agency. [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \"Romantic Relations\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after.\n[[File:Natalie Barry Evans EE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] and Natalie marry (1999)|170px]]\n\nDespite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on [[New Year's Eve]] in 1999, in a joint wedding with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]). They live with Barry's father [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and stepmother [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son [[Jack Evans (EastEnders)|Jack]] (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002\u2014the birth is traumatic as Jack was [[breech birth|born feet first]]. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, [[Nathan Williams (EastEnders)|Nathan Williams]] ([[Doug Allen (actor)|Doug Allen]]), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.\n\nFeeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave [[Albert Square]] with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by [[Paul Trueman]] ([[Gary Beadle]]), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, the day after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in [[Scotland]]. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing.\n\nSuspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\n1994 was a \"historic\" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]).

In an interview with the \u2018\u2019Walford Gazette\u2019\u2019, Speed commented: \u201cI was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me\u2026But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on\u2026they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them\u2026I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!\u201d<ref name=\"wg\"/>\n\n===Reintroduction and marriage to Barry Evans===\nAfter a four-year absence, Lucy Speed decided that she wanted to return to the series.

Perfectly reasonable, you might think [\u2026] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew \u2013 thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\nNightingale suggested that the storyline \"echoed\" the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted to make her own decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a \"subtle\" reinforcement of an \"underlying implication\" that women should be punished for exercising their legal right.<ref name=\"CUSU\"/> She comments, \"I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment \u2013 such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point \u2013 and the only one I can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure \u2013 come on, what do you know?\".<ref name=\"CUSU\"/>\n\n====Adultery====\nNatalie and Barry's marriage sours towards the end of 2002, when she is momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen).

As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling.

Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" \u2013 attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public \u2013 manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"[Natalie] can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chris Barker|title= Global Television: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/globaltelevision00chri|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-20150-2}}</ref>\n\nLinda Ruth Williams, author of ''The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema'', was critical of a scene featuring Natalie speaking in a derogatory manner about the [[erotic thriller]] film genre.

Natalie retorted that \"pinning me up against the erotic thriller section\" was not her idea of a romantic setting for sex.

He began singing on local radio shows,{{r|jacobs19990612}} including an appearance on [[WSB (AM)|WSB AM]] in Atlanta. As a result of Kelley's radio work, he won an engagement with Lew Forbes and his orchestra at the Paramount Theater.<ref name=bio/>\n\nIn 1934, the family left Conyers for [[Decatur, Georgia]]. He attended the Decatur Boys High School, where he played on the Decatur Bantams baseball team. Kelley also played football and other sports. Before his graduation in 1938, Kelley got a job as a drugstore car hop. He spent his weekends working in the local theaters.<ref name=bio />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Kelley served as an enlisted man in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from March 10, 1943 to January 28, 1946, assigned to the [[First Motion Picture Unit]]. After an extended stay in [[Long Beach, California]], Kelley decided to pursue an acting career and relocate to Southern California permanently, living for a time with his uncle Casey. He worked as an usher in a local theater to earn enough money for the move. Kelley's mother encouraged her son in his new career goal, but his father disliked the idea. While in California, Kelley was spotted by a [[Paramount Pictures]] scout while doing a [[United States Navy]] training film.<ref name=bio />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early roles ===\n\nKelley's acting career began with the feature film ''[[Fear in the Night (1947 film)|Fear in the Night]]'' in 1947.<ref>{{cite news | title = DeForest Kelley, Actor Beloved as Dr. McCoy on 'Star Trek,' Dies at 79 | date = June 12, 1999 | first = Elaine | last = Woo | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | page = 30 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/12/local/me-45666}}</ref> The low-budget movie was a hit, bringing him to the attention of a national audience and giving Kelley reason to believe he would soon become a star. His next role, in ''[[Variety Girl]]'', established him as a leading actor and resulted in the founding of his first [[fan club]]. Kelley did not become a leading man, however, and his wife Carolyn and he decided to move to New York City. He found work on stage and on live television, but after three years in New York, the Kelleys returned to [[Hollywood]].\n\nIn California, he received a role in an installment of ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]],'' anchored by [[Walter Cronkite]]. He played ranch owner Bob Kitteridge in the 1949 episode \"Legion of Old Timers\" of the television series ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''. This led to an appearance in ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' as [[Morgan Earp]] (brother to [[Burt Lancaster]]'s [[Wyatt Earp]]). This role led to three movie offers, including ''[[Warlock (1959 film)|Warlock]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Anthony Quinn]].\n\nIn 1957, he had a small role as a Southern officer in ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'', a Civil War film directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], alongside [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Montgomery Clift]], and [[Lee Marvin]]. He also appeared in leading roles as a U.S. Navy submarine captain in the World War II set television series, ''[[The Silent Service (TV series)|The Silent Service]]''.  He appeared in season one, episode five, \"The Spearfish Delivers\", as Commander Dempsey and in the first episode of season two, \"The Archerfish Spits Straight\", as Lieutenant Commander Enright. His future ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' co-star [[Leonard Nimoy]] also appeared in two different episodes of the series around the same time.\n\nKelley appeared three times in various portrayals of the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], The first was in 1955, as [[Ike Clanton]] in the television series ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]]''. Two years later, in the 1957 [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|film of that name]], he played Morgan Earp. His third appearance was in a third-season ''Star Trek'' episode (broadcast originally on October 25, 1968), titled \"[[Spectre of the Gun]]\", this time portraying [[Tom McLaury]].\n\nKelley also appeared in episodes of ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo|Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Boots and Saddles (TV series)|Boots and Saddles]]'', ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]'', ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel (TV series)|Have Gun - Will Travel]]'', and ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]''. He appeared in the 1962 episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', \"1800 Days to Justice\" and \"The Clover Throne\" as Willis. He had a small role in the movie ''[[The View from Pompey's Head]]''.\n\nFor nine years, Kelley primarily played villains. He built up an extensive list of credits, alternating between television and motion pictures. However, he was afraid of [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]], so he broke away from villains by starring in ''[[Where Love Has Gone (film)|Where Love Has Gone]]'' and a television pilot called ''333 Montgomery''. The pilot was written by an ex-policeman named [[Gene Roddenberry]], and a few years later Kelley appeared in another Roddenberry pilot, ''Police Story'' (1967), that was again not developed into a series.\n\nKelley also appeared in at least one radio drama, ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'', where series producer William M. Robson introduced him as \"a bright new luminary in the Hollywood firmament\".\n\n===''Star Trek''===\n[[File:DeForest Kelley, Dr. McCoy, Star Trek.jpg|thumb|180px|Kelley as Dr. McCoy]]\nIn 1956, nine years before being cast as Dr. McCoy, Kelley played a small supporting role as a medic in ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' in which he utters the diagnosis \"This man's dead, Captain\" and \"That man is dead\" to [[Gregory Peck]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w_Ml9jiAQM | title = Excerpt The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit | publisher = YouTube | date = April 22, 2008 | accessdate = June 14, 2014}}</ref> Kelley appeared as Lieutenant Commander James Dempsey in two episodes of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] military drama ''The Silent Service'', based on actual stories of the submarine service of the [[United States Navy]]. In 1962, he appeared in the ''[[Bonanza]]'' episode titled \"The Decision\", as a doctor sentenced to hang for the murder of a journalist. The judge in this episode was portrayed by [[John Hoyt]], who later portrayed Dr. Phillip John Boyce, one of Leonard McCoy's predecessors, on the ''Star Trek'' pilot \"[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]\". In 1963, he appeared in ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' episode \"Man of Violence\" as a \"drinking\" cavalry doctor with Leonard Nimoy as his patient. (Nimoy's character did not survive.) Perhaps not coincidentally, the episode was written by [[John D. F. Black]], who went on to become a writer-producer on ''Star Trek''. Just before ''Star Trek'' began filming, Kelley appeared as a doctor again, in the ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]'' episode \"The Sound of Terror\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0624875/ | title = \"Laredo\" Sound of Terror (TV Episode 1966) | author = wes-connors | date = December 27, 2008 | website = IMDb}}</ref>\n\nAfter refusing Roddenberry's 1964 offer to play Spock,<ref>{{cite web | last1 = StarTrek.com | first1 = staff | title = Star Trek Remembering DeForest Kelley | url = http://www.startrek.com/article/remembering-deforest-kelley | website = startrek.com | publisher = CBS Entertainment | accessdate = August 26, 2014 <!-- , 12:59 --> | ref = 7}}</ref> Kelley played Dr. [[Leonard McCoy|Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy]] from 1966 to 1969 in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. He reprised the character in a voice-over role in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (1973\u201374), and the first six ''Star Trek'' motion pictures (1979 to 1991). In 1987, he also had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", the first episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', as Admiral Leonard McCoy, Starfleet Surgeon General Emeritus.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094030/fullcredits | title = \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987) | publisher =  | via = www.imdb.com}}</ref> Several aspects of Kelley's background became part of McCoy's characterization, including his pronunciation of \"nuclear\" as \"[[nucular]]\".\n\nKelley became a good friend of ''Star Trek'' castmates [[William Shatner]] and Leonard Nimoy, from their first meeting in 1964. During ''Trek'''s first season, Kelley's name was listed in the end credits along with the rest of the cast. Only Shatner and Nimoy were listed in the opening credits. As Kelley's role grew in importance during the first season, he received a pay raise to about $2,500 per episode and received third billing starting in the second season after Nimoy. Despite the show's recognition of Kelley as one of its stars, he was frustrated by the greater attention that Shatner received as its lead actor and that Nimoy received because of \"Spockamania\" among fans.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nShy by his own admission, Kelley was the only cast member of the original ''Star Trek'' series program never to have written or published an autobiography; the authorized biography ''From Sawdust to Stardust'' (2005) was written posthumously by Terry Lee Rioux of [[Lamar University]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Kelley regarded \"[[The Empath]]\" as his favorite ''Star Trek'' television episode.<ref>[http://www.orionpressfanzines.com/articles/empath.htm \"The Empath\"] Story outline report and script analysis by Dave Eversole</ref>\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:DeForest Kelley - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]\nAfter ''Star Trek'', Kelley found himself a victim of the very [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] he had so feared. In 1972, he was cast in the horror film ''[[Night of the Lepus]]''. Kelley thereafter did a few television appearances and a few movies, but essentially went into ''de facto'' retirement other than playing McCoy.<ref name=\"marriott19910915\">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/arts/tv-view-the-star-trek-curse-a-lifetime-starfleet-commission.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title = TV View; the 'Star Trek' Curse: a Lifetime Starfleet Commission | work = The New York Times | date = September 15, 1991 | accessdate = May 3, 2011 | author = Marriott, Michael}}</ref> By 1978, he was earning up to $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1978|r=-3}}}} today) annually from appearances at [[Star Trek convention|''Star Trek'' conventions]].<ref name=\"michaels19781210\">{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cgsjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eswFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5061%2C5024378 | title = A Visit to Star Trek's Movie Launch | work = Parade | date = December 10, 1978 | accessdate = May 2, 2011 | author = Michaels, Marguerite}}</ref> Like other ''Star Trek'' actors, Kelley received little of the enormous profits that the franchise generated for Paramount, until Nimoy, as executive producer, helped arrange for Kelley to be paid $1 million for ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), which was his final live-action film appearance. He also appeared in the first ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode, \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", in which he portrayed a 137-year-old Dr. McCoy.<ref name=bio /> For his final film, Kelley provided the voice of [[Viking 1]] in the second and third installments in the children's series ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''. Later in life, Kelley developed an interest in poetry, eventually publishing the first of two books in an unfinished series, ''The Big Bird's Dream'' and ''The Dream Goes On''.\n\nIn a [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] interview done in the late 1990s, Kelley joked that one of his biggest fears was that the words etched on his gravestone would be \"[[He's dead, Jim]]\". Kelley's obituary in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine began: \"We're not even going to try to resist: He's dead, Jim\".<ref>''Newsweek'', July 20, 1999.</ref> He stated the year before his death that his legacy would be the many people McCoy had inspired to become doctors; \"That's something that very few people can say they've done.

He began singing on local radio shows,{{r|jacobs19990612}} including an appearance on [[WSB (AM)|WSB AM]] in Atlanta. As a result of Kelley's radio work, he won an engagement with Lew Forbes and his orchestra at the Paramount Theater.<ref name=bio/>\n\nIn 1934, the family left Conyers for [[Decatur, Georgia]]. He attended the Decatur Boys High School, where he played on the Decatur Bantams baseball team. Kelley also played football and other sports. Before his graduation in 1938, Kelley got a job as a drugstore car hop. He spent his weekends working in the local theaters.<ref name=bio />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Kelley served as an enlisted man in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from March 10, 1943 to January 28, 1946, assigned to the [[First Motion Picture Unit]]. After an extended stay in [[Long Beach, California]], Kelley decided to pursue an acting career and relocate to Southern California permanently, living for a time with his uncle Casey. He worked as an usher in a local theater to earn enough money for the move. Kelley's mother encouraged her son in his new career goal, but his father disliked the idea. While in California, Kelley was spotted by a [[Paramount Pictures]] scout while doing a [[United States Navy]] training film.<ref name=bio />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early roles ===\n\nKelley's acting career began with the feature film ''[[Fear in the Night (1947 film)|Fear in the Night]]'' in 1947.<ref>{{cite news | title = DeForest Kelley, Actor Beloved as Dr. McCoy on 'Star Trek,' Dies at 79 | date = June 12, 1999 | first = Elaine | last = Woo | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | page = 30 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/12/local/me-45666}}</ref> The low-budget movie was a hit, bringing him to the attention of a national audience and giving Kelley reason to believe he would soon become a star. His next role, in ''[[Variety Girl]]'', established him as a leading actor and resulted in the founding of his first [[fan club]]. Kelley did not become a leading man, however, and his wife Carolyn and he decided to move to New York City. He found work on stage and on live television, but after three years in New York, the Kelleys returned to [[Hollywood]].\n\nIn California, he received a role in an installment of ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]],'' anchored by [[Walter Cronkite]]. He played ranch owner Bob Kitteridge in the 1949 episode \"Legion of Old Timers\" of the television series ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''. This led to an appearance in ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' as [[Morgan Earp]] (brother to [[Burt Lancaster]]'s [[Wyatt Earp]]). This role led to three movie offers, including ''[[Warlock (1959 film)|Warlock]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Anthony Quinn]].\n\nIn 1957, he had a small role as a Southern officer in ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'', a Civil War film directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], alongside [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Montgomery Clift]], and [[Lee Marvin]]. He also appeared in leading roles as a U.S. Navy submarine captain in the World War II set television series, ''[[The Silent Service (TV series)|The Silent Service]]''.  He appeared in season one, episode five, \"The Spearfish Delivers\", as Commander Dempsey and in the first episode of season two, \"The Archerfish Spits Straight\", as Lieutenant Commander Enright. His future ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' co-star [[Leonard Nimoy]] also appeared in two different episodes of the series around the same time.\n\nKelley appeared three times in various portrayals of the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], The first was in 1955, as [[Ike Clanton]] in the television series ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]]''. Two years later, in the 1957 [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|film of that name]], he played Morgan Earp. His third appearance was in a third-season ''Star Trek'' episode (broadcast originally on October 25, 1968), titled \"[[Spectre of the Gun]]\", this time portraying [[Tom McLaury]].\n\nKelley also appeared in episodes of ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo|Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Boots and Saddles (TV series)|Boots and Saddles]]'', ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]'', ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel (TV series)|Have Gun - Will Travel]]'', and ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]''. He appeared in the 1962 episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', \"1800 Days to Justice\" and \"The Clover Throne\" as Willis. He had a small role in the movie ''[[The View from Pompey's Head]]''.\n\nFor nine years, Kelley primarily played villains. He built up an extensive list of credits, alternating between television and motion pictures. However, he was afraid of [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]], so he broke away from villains by starring in ''[[Where Love Has Gone (film)|Where Love Has Gone]]'' and a television pilot called ''333 Montgomery''. The pilot was written by an ex-policeman named [[Gene Roddenberry]], and a few years later Kelley appeared in another Roddenberry pilot, ''Police Story'' (1967), that was again not developed into a series.\n\nKelley also appeared in at least one radio drama, ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'', where series producer William M. Robson introduced him as \"a bright new luminary in the Hollywood firmament\".\n\n===''Star Trek''===\n[[File:DeForest Kelley, Dr. McCoy, Star Trek.jpg|thumb|180px|Kelley as Dr. McCoy]]\nIn 1956, nine years before being cast as Dr. McCoy, Kelley played a small supporting role as a medic in ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' in which he utters the diagnosis \"This man's dead, Captain\" and \"That man is dead\" to [[Gregory Peck]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w_Ml9jiAQM | title = Excerpt The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit | publisher = YouTube | date = April 22, 2008 | accessdate = June 14, 2014}}</ref> Kelley appeared as Lieutenant Commander James Dempsey in two episodes of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] military drama ''The Silent Service'', based on actual stories of the submarine service of the [[United States Navy]]. In 1962, he appeared in the ''[[Bonanza]]'' episode titled \"The Decision\", as a doctor sentenced to hang for the murder of a journalist. The judge in this episode was portrayed by [[John Hoyt]], who later portrayed Dr. Phillip John Boyce, one of Leonard McCoy's predecessors, on the ''Star Trek'' pilot \"[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]\". In 1963, he appeared in ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' episode \"Man of Violence\" as a \"drinking\" cavalry doctor with Leonard Nimoy as his patient. (Nimoy's character did not survive.) Perhaps not coincidentally, the episode was written by [[John D. F. Black]], who went on to become a writer-producer on ''Star Trek''. Just before ''Star Trek'' began filming, Kelley appeared as a doctor again, in the ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]'' episode \"The Sound of Terror\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0624875/ | title = \"Laredo\" Sound of Terror (TV Episode 1966) | author = wes-connors | date = December 27, 2008 | website = IMDb}}</ref>\n\nAfter refusing Roddenberry's 1964 offer to play Spock,<ref>{{cite web | last1 = StarTrek.com | first1 = staff | title = Star Trek Remembering DeForest Kelley | url = http://www.startrek.com/article/remembering-deforest-kelley | website = startrek.com | publisher = CBS Entertainment | accessdate = August 26, 2014 <!-- , 12:59 --> | ref = 7}}</ref> Kelley played Dr. [[Leonard McCoy|Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy]] from 1966 to 1969 in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. He reprised the character in a voice-over role in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (1973\u201374), and the first six ''Star Trek'' motion pictures (1979 to 1991). In 1987, he also had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", the first episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', as Admiral Leonard McCoy, Starfleet Surgeon General Emeritus.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094030/fullcredits | title = \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" Encounter at Farpoint (TV Episode 1987) | publisher =  | via = www.imdb.com}}</ref> Several aspects of Kelley's background became part of McCoy's characterization, including his pronunciation of \"nuclear\" as \"[[nucular]]\".\n\nKelley became a good friend of ''Star Trek'' castmates [[William Shatner]] and Leonard Nimoy, from their first meeting in 1964. During ''Trek'''s first season, Kelley's name was listed in the end credits along with the rest of the cast. Only Shatner and Nimoy were listed in the opening credits. As Kelley's role grew in importance during the first season, he received a pay raise to about $2,500 per episode and received third billing starting in the second season after Nimoy. Despite the show's recognition of Kelley as one of its stars, he was frustrated by the greater attention that Shatner received as its lead actor and that Nimoy received because of \"Spockamania\" among fans.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nShy by his own admission, Kelley was the only cast member of the original ''Star Trek'' series program never to have written or published an autobiography; the authorized biography ''From Sawdust to Stardust'' (2005) was written posthumously by Terry Lee Rioux of [[Lamar University]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Kelley regarded \"[[The Empath]]\" as his favorite ''Star Trek'' television episode.<ref>[http://www.orionpressfanzines.com/articles/empath.htm \"The Empath\"] Story outline report and script analysis by Dave Eversole</ref>\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:DeForest Kelley - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]\nAfter ''Star Trek'', Kelley found himself a victim of the very [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] he had so feared. In 1972, he was cast in the horror film ''[[Night of the Lepus]]''. Kelley thereafter did a few television appearances and a few movies, but essentially went into ''de facto'' retirement other than playing McCoy.<ref name=\"marriott19910915\">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/arts/tv-view-the-star-trek-curse-a-lifetime-starfleet-commission.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title = TV View; the 'Star Trek' Curse: a Lifetime Starfleet Commission | work = The New York Times | date = September 15, 1991 | accessdate = May 3, 2011 | author = Marriott, Michael}}</ref> By 1978, he was earning up to $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1978|r=-3}}}} today) annually from appearances at [[Star Trek convention|''Star Trek'' conventions]].<ref name=\"michaels19781210\">{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cgsjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eswFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5061%2C5024378 | title = A Visit to Star Trek's Movie Launch | work = Parade | date = December 10, 1978 | accessdate = May 2, 2011 | author = Michaels, Marguerite}}</ref> Like other ''Star Trek'' actors, Kelley received little of the enormous profits that the franchise generated for Paramount, until Nimoy, as executive producer, helped arrange for Kelley to be paid $1 million for ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), which was his final live-action film appearance. He also appeared in the first ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode, \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", in which he portrayed a 137-year-old Dr. McCoy.<ref name=bio /> For his final film, Kelley provided the voice of [[Viking 1]] in the second and third installments in the children's series ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''. Later in life, Kelley developed an interest in poetry, eventually publishing the first of two books in an unfinished series, ''The Big Bird's Dream'' and ''The Dream Goes On''.\n\nIn a [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] interview done in the late 1990s, Kelley joked that one of his biggest fears was that the words etched on his gravestone would be \"[[He's dead, Jim]]\". Kelley's obituary in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine began: \"We're not even going to try to resist: He's dead, Jim\".<ref>''Newsweek'', July 20, 1999.</ref> He stated the year before his death that his legacy would be the many people McCoy had inspired to become doctors; \"That's something that very few people can say they've done. I'm proud to say that I have\".{{r|jacobs19990612}}\nIn 1991, he received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and in 1999, shortly before he died, he was awarded a [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]] for his contribution to the genre of Western television and movies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.startrek.com/article/exclusive-interview-author-kristine-m-smith-remembers-deforest-kelley | title = Author Kristine M.

The best-known (credit) [[card association]]s are [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[China UnionPay]], [[American Express]], [[Diners Club International|Diners Club]], [[Japan Credit Bureau]] and [[RuPay|Indian Rupay]].\n\nThe acquiring bank enters into a contract with a merchant and offers it a [[merchant account]]. This arrangement provides the merchant with a [[line of credit]].  Under the agreement, the acquiring bank exchanges funds with [[issuing bank]]s on behalf of the merchant, and pays the merchant for its daily payment-card activity's net balance\u2014that is, gross sales minus reversals, [[interchange fee]]s, and acquirer fees. Acquirer fees are an additional markup added to association interchange fees by the acquiring bank, and those fees vary at the acquirer's discretion.\n\n==Risk==\nThe acquiring bank accepts the risk that the merchant will remain [[solvency|solvent]]. The main source of risk to the acquiring bank is fund reversals.  Consumers can trigger the reversal of funds in three ways:\n\n* A card refund is the return of funds to the consumer, voluntarily initiated by the merchant.\n* A card reversal is where the merchant cancels a transaction after it has been authorized but before settlement occurs.\n* A card [[chargeback]] occurs in a dispute between the merchant and the cardholder over the validity of the transaction. The cardholder may request the return of funds through the issuing bank for various reasons, including that the goods were not received or were faulty, or that the cardholder lacks knowledge of the transaction.\n\nCard associations consider a participating merchant to be a risk if more than 1% of payments received result in a chargeback.<ref>https://chargeback.com/average-chargeback-rates-how-does-your-business-compare|title=Average Chargeback Rates: How Does Your Business Compare?</ref> [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] levy fines against acquiring banks that retain merchants with a high chargeback frequency. To defray the cost of any fines received, the acquiring banks are inclined (but not required) to pass such fines on to the merchant. These fees are generally charged to the merchant.\n\nNew merchants pose risk to acquiring banks as well, beyond solvency concerns. A fraudulent new merchant could take a large number of orders, and after receiving payment, disappear without delivering the promised goods or services. As such, identifying legitimate vs. fraudulent new businesses is critical for acquiring banks.<ref>https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/14769/three-types-of-merchant-fraud-a-guide-for-merchant-acquirers|title=Three Types of Merchant Fraud: A Guide For Merchant Acquirers</ref>\n\nDue to the high amount of risk that acquiring banks are anticipated to face, as well as their key position in the payment chain, the security of electronic payments is a great concern for these institutions. For this reason, they have been involved in the development of electronic point-of-sale security standards such as [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI-DSS]]. Many acquiring banks insist on their merchants being PCI-DSS compliant. If merchants are not PCI-DSS compliant, the merchants themselves may be responsible for losses due to fraud, which may result in fines from the card schemes.<ref>https://www.cashflows.com/becoming-pci-dss-compliant</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Payment gateway]]\n* [[Payment processor]]\n* [[Payment service provider]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Merchant services]]\n[[Category:Payment systems]]\n[[Category:Banking terms]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}\nAn '''acquiring bank''' (also known simply as an '''acquirer''') is a [[bank]] or [[Financial centre|financial]] institution that processes [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]] payments on behalf of a merchant.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://chargebacks911.com/knowledge-base/difference-between-acquiring-bank-and-issuing-bank/ |title=Difference Between \u2018Acquiring Bank\u2019 and \u2018Issuing Bank\u2019 |date=April 6, 2015 |publisher=chargebacks911}}</ref> The acquirer allows merchants to accept credit card payments from the card-issuing banks within an association.

The patient only showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home; he was subsequently confirmed to have completely recovered. Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease, while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness. The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020. {{As of|2020|03|29}}, three additional cases have been confirmed, including one each in Kailali and Baglung districts. All five confirmed cases have been in people who had recently returned from abroad. The four patients under treatment are reported to be in \"normal\" condition. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March, and is scheduled to end on 8 April.\n\nNepal established health-desks at the international airport as well as on border checkpoints with India, starting in mid-January. Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds. The [[SAARC]] countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region. India, the United States and Germany have increased their support to Nepali health sector.\n\nNepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to ''Visit Nepal Year 2020''.

It is unknown whether '''NC''' = '''P''', but most researchers suspect this to be false, meaning that there are probably some tractable problems that are \"inherently sequential\" and cannot significantly be sped up by using parallelism. Just as the class '''[[NP-complete]]''' can be thought of as \"probably intractable\", so the class '''[[P-complete]]''', when using '''NC''' reductions, can be thought of as \"probably not parallelizable\" or \"probably inherently sequential\".\n\nThe parallel computer in the definition can be assumed to be a ''parallel, random-access machine'' ([[parallel random access machine|PRAM]]).  That is a parallel computer with a central pool of memory, and any processor can access any bit of memory in constant time.  The definition of '''NC''' is not affected by the choice of how the PRAM handles simultaneous access to a single bit by more than one processor. It can be CRCW, CREW, or EREW. See [[parallel random access machine|PRAM]] for descriptions of those models.\n\nEquivalently, '''NC''' can be defined as those decision problems decidable by a [[Boolean circuit|uniform Boolean circuit]] (which can be calculated from the length of the input, for NC, we suppose we can compute the Boolean circuit of size ''n'' in logarithmic space in ''n'') with [[polylogarithmic]] depth and a polynomial number of gates.\n\n'''RNC''' is a class extending '''NC''' with access to randomness.\n\n== Problems in NC ==\nAs with '''P''', by a slight abuse of language, one might classify function problems and search problems as being in '''NC'''. '''NC''' is known to include many problems, including\n* Integer addition, multiplication and division;\n* [[Matrix multiplication]], determinant, [[matrix inverse|inverse]], rank;\n* Polynomial GCD, by a reduction to linear algebra using [[Sylvester matrix]]\n* Finding a maximal matching.\n\nOften algorithms for those problems had to be separately invented and could not be na\u00efvely adapted from well-known algorithms \u2013 [[Gaussian elimination]] and [[Euclidean algorithm]] rely on operations performed in sequence. One might contrast [[ripple carry adder]] with a [[carry-lookahead adder]].\n\n== The NC hierarchy ==\n'''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> is the class of decision problems decidable by uniform boolean circuits with a polynomial number of gates of at most two inputs and depth {{math|''O''(log<sup>''i''</sup>&nbsp;''n'')}}, or the class of decision problems solvable in time ''O''(log<sup>''i''</sup>&nbsp;''n'') on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors. Clearly, we have\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^2 \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^i \\subseteq \\cdots \\mathsf{NC}</math>\n\nwhich forms the '''NC'''-hierarchy.\n\nWe can relate the '''NC''' classes to the space classes '''[[L (complexity)|L]]''' and '''[[NL (complexity)|NL]]'''<ref>Papadimitriou (1994) Theorem 16.1</ref> and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''.<ref name=CK437>Clote & Kranakis (2002) p.437</ref>\n\n:<math> \\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{L} \\subseteq \\mathsf{NL} \\subseteq \\mathsf{AC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{P}.</math>\n\nThe NC classes are related to the AC classes, which are defined similarly, but with gates having unbounded fan-in.  For each ''i'', we have<ref name=AB118/><ref name=\"CK437\"/>\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{NC}^i \\subseteq \\mathsf{AC}^i \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^{i+1}.</math>\n\nAs an immediate consequence of this, we have that '''NC''' = '''AC'''.<ref name=CK12>Clote & Kranakis (2002) p.12</ref>\nIt is known that both inclusions are strict for ''i'' = 0.<ref name=AB118/>\n\nSimilarly, we have that '''NC''' is equivalent to the problems solvable on an [[alternating Turing machine]] restricted to at most two options at each step with ''O''(log ''n'') space and <math>(\\log n)^{O(1)}</math> alternations.<ref>{{cite journal|author=S.

It was observed by Papadimitriou that, if '''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> = '''NC'''<sup>''i''+1</sup> for some ''i'', then '''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> = '''NC'''<sup>''j''</sup> for all ''j''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''i'', and as a result, '''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> = '''NC'''. This observation is known as '''NC'''-hierarchy collapse because even a single equality in the chain of containments\n:<math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^2 \\subseteq \\cdots</math>\nimplies that the entire '''NC''' hierarchy \"collapses\" down to some level ''i''. Thus, there are 2 possibilities:\n\n# <math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathsf{NC}^i \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathsf{NC}^{i+j} \\subset \\cdots \\mathsf{NC}</math>\n# <math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathsf{NC}^i = \\cdots = \\mathsf{NC}^{i+j} = \\cdots \\mathsf{NC}</math>\n\nIt is widely believed that (1) is the case, although no proof as to the truth of either statement has yet been discovered.\n\n==Barrington's theorem==\nA '''branching program''' with ''n'' variables of width ''k'' and length ''m'' consists of a sequence of ''m'' instructions. Each of the instructions is a tuple (''i'', ''p'', ''q'') where ''i'' is the index of variable to check (1 &le; ''i'' &le; ''n''), and ''p'' and ''q'' are functions from {1, 2, ..., ''k''} to {1, 2, ..., ''k''}. Numbers 1, 2, ..., ''k'' are called states of the branching program. The program initially starts in state 1, and each instruction (''i'', ''p'', ''q'') changes the state from ''x'' to ''p''(''x'') or ''q''(''x''), depending on whether the ''i''th variable is 0 or 1.\n\nA family of branching programs consists of a branching program with ''n'' variables for each ''n''.\n\nIt is easy to show that every language ''L'' on {0,1} can be recognized by a family of branching programs of width 5 and exponential length, or by a family of exponential width and linear length.\n\nEvery regular language on {0,1} can be recognized by a family of branching programs of constant width and linear number of instructions (since a DFA can be converted to a branching program). '''BWBP''' denotes the class of languages recognizable by a family of branching programs of bounded width and polynomial length.<ref name=CK50>Clote & Kranakis (2002) p.50</ref>\n\n'''Barrington's theorem'''<ref name=Bar89>{{cite journal | zbl=0667.68059 | last=Barrington | first=David A. | journal=J.

The proof uses the [[solvable group|nonsolvability]] of the symmetric group S<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=CK50/>\n\nThe theorem is rather surprising. For instance, it implies that the [[majority function]] can be computed by a family of branching programs of constant width and polynomial size, while intuition might suggest that to achieve polynomial size, one needs a linear number of states.\n\n===Proof of Barrington's theorem===\nA branching program of constant width and polynomial size can be easily converted (via divide-and-conquer) to a circuit in '''NC'''<sup>1</sup>.\n\nConversely, suppose a circuit in '''NC'''<sup>1</sup> is given. Without loss of generality, assume it uses only AND and NOT gates.\n\nLemma 1: If there exists a branching program that sometimes works as a permutation ''P'' and sometimes as a permutation ''Q'', by right-multiplying permutations in the first instruction by \u03b1, and in the last instruction left-multiplying by \u03b2, we can make a circuit of the same length that behaves as \u03b2''P''\u03b1 or \u03b2''Q''\u03b1, respectively.\n\nCall a branching program \u03b1-computing a circuit ''C'' if it works as identity when C's output is 0, and as \u03b1 when C's output is 1.\n\nAs a consequence of Lemma 1 and the fact that all cycles of length 5 are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]], for any two 5-cycles \u03b1, \u03b2, if there exists a branching program \u03b1-computing a circuit ''C'', then there exists a branching program \u03b2-computing the circuit ''C'', of the same length.\n\nLemma 2: There exist 5-cycles \u03b3, \u03b4 such that their [[commutator]] \u03b5=\u03b3\u03b4\u03b3<sup>\u22121</sup>\u03b4<sup>\u22121</sup> is a 5-cycle. For example, \u03b3 = (1 2 3 4 5), \u03b4 = (1 3 5 4 2) giving \u03b5 = (1 3 2 5 4).\n\nWe will now prove Barrington's theorem by induction:\n\nSuppose we have a circuit ''C'' which takes inputs ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>n</sub> and assume that for all subcircuits ''D'' of ''C'' and 5-cycles \u03b1, there exists a branching program \u03b1-computing ''D''. We will show that for all 5-cycles \u03b1, there exists a branching program \u03b1-computing ''C''.\n\n* If the circuit ''C'' simply outputs some input bit ''x<sub>i</sub>'', the branching program we need has just one instruction: checking ''x<sub>i</sub>'''s value (0 or 1), and outputting the identity or \u03b1 (respectively).\n* If the circuit ''C'' outputs \u00ac''A'' for some different circuit ''A'', create a branching program \u03b1<sup>\u22121</sup>-computing ''A'' and then multiply the output of the program by \u03b1. By Lemma 1, we get a branching program for ''A'' outputting the identity or \u03b1, i.e. \u03b1-computing \u00ac''A''=''C''.\n* If the circuit ''C'' outputs ''A''\u2227''B'' for circuits ''A'' and ''B'', join the branching programs that \u03b3-compute ''A'', \u03b4-compute B, \u03b3<sup>\u22121</sup>-compute ''A'', and \u03b4<sup>\u22121</sup>-compute B for a choice of 5-cycles \u03b3 and \u03b4 such that their commutator \u03b5=\u03b3\u03b4\u03b3<sup>\u22121</sup>\u03b4<sup>\u22121</sup> is also a 5-cycle. (The existence of such elements was established in Lemma 2.) If one or both of the circuits outputs 0, the resulting program will be the identity due to cancellation; if both circuits output 1, the resulting program will output the commutator \u03b5. In other words, we get a program \u03b5-computing ''A''\u2227''B''. Because \u03b5 and \u03b1 are two 5-cycles, they are conjugate, and hence there exists a program \u03b1-computing ''A''\u2227''B'' by Lemma 1.\n\nBy assuming the subcircuits have branching programs so that they are \u03b1-computing for all 5-cycles \u03b1\u2208''S''<sub>5</sub>, we have shown ''C'' also has this property, as required.\n\nThe size of the branching program is at most 4<sup>d</sup>, where ''d'' is the depth of the circuit. If the circuit has logarithmic depth, the branching program has polynomial length.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | zbl=1193.68112 | last1=Arora | first1=Sanjeev | authorlink1=Sanjeev Arora | last2=Barak | first2=Boaz | title=Computational complexity.

It is unknown whether '''NC''' = '''P''', but most researchers suspect this to be false, meaning that there are probably some tractable problems that are \"inherently sequential\" and cannot significantly be sped up by using parallelism. Just as the class '''[[NP-complete]]''' can be thought of as \"probably intractable\", so the class '''[[P-complete]]''', when using '''NC''' reductions, can be thought of as \"probably not parallelizable\" or \"probably inherently sequential\".\n\nThe parallel computer in the definition can be assumed to be a ''parallel, random-access machine'' ([[parallel random access machine|PRAM]]).  That is a parallel computer with a central pool of memory, and any processor can access any bit of memory in constant time.  The definition of '''NC''' is not affected by the choice of how the PRAM handles simultaneous access to a single bit by more than one processor. It can be CRCW, CREW, or EREW. See [[parallel random access machine|PRAM]] for descriptions of those models.\n\nEquivalently, '''NC''' can be defined as those decision problems decidable by a [[Boolean circuit|uniform Boolean circuit]] (which can be calculated from the length of the input, for NC, we suppose we can compute the Boolean circuit of size ''n'' in logarithmic space in ''n'') with [[polylogarithmic]] depth and a polynomial number of gates.\n\n'''RNC''' is a class extending '''NC''' with access to randomness.\n\n== Problems in NC ==\nAs with '''P''', by a slight abuse of language, one might classify function problems and search problems as being in '''NC'''. '''NC''' is known to include many problems, including\n* Integer addition, multiplication and division;\n* Matrix multiplication, determinant, inverse, rank;\n* Polynomial GCD, by a reduction to linear algebra using [[Sylvester matrix]]\n* Finding a maximal matching.\n\nOften algorithms for those problems had to be separately invented and could not be na\u00efvely adapted from well-known algorithms \u2013 Gaussian elimination and Euclidean algorithm rely on operations performed in sequence. One might contrast [[ripple carry adder]] with a [[carry-lookahead adder]].\n\n== The NC hierarchy ==\n'''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> is the class of decision problems decidable by uniform boolean circuits with a polynomial number of gates of at most two inputs and depth {{math|''O''(log<sup>''i''</sup>&nbsp;''n'')}}, or the class of decision problems solvable in time ''O''(log<sup>''i''</sup>&nbsp;''n'') on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors. Clearly, we have\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^2 \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^i \\subseteq \\cdots \\mathsf{NC}</math>\n\nwhich forms the '''NC'''-hierarchy.\n\nWe can relate the '''NC''' classes to the space classes '''[[L (complexity)|L]]''' and '''[[NL (complexity)|NL]]'''<ref>Papadimitriou (1994) Theorem 16.1</ref> and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''.<ref name=CK437>Clote & Kranakis (2002) p.437</ref>\n\n:<math> \\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{L} \\subseteq \\mathsf{NL} \\subseteq \\mathsf{AC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^2 \\subseteq \\mathsf{P}.</math>\n\nThe NC classes are related to the AC classes, which are defined similarly, but with gates having unbounded fan-in.  For each ''i'', we have<ref name=AB118/><ref name=\"CK437\"/>\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{NC}^i \\subseteq \\mathsf{AC}^i \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^{i+1}.</math>\n\nAs an immediate consequence of this, we have that '''NC''' = '''AC'''.<ref name=CK12>Clote & Kranakis (2002) p.12</ref>\nIt is known that both inclusions are strict for ''i'' = 0.<ref name=AB118/>\n\nSimilarly, we have that '''NC''' is equivalent to the problems solvable on an [[alternating Turing machine]] restricted to at most two options at each step with ''O''(log ''n'') space and <math>(\\log n)^{O(1)}</math> alternations.<ref>{{cite journal|author=S.

It was observed by Papadimitriou that, if '''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> = '''NC'''<sup>''i''+1</sup> for some ''i'', then '''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> = '''NC'''<sup>''j''</sup> for all ''j''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''i'', and as a result, '''NC'''<sup>''i''</sup> = '''NC'''. This observation is known as '''NC'''-hierarchy collapse because even a single equality in the chain of containments\n:<math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subseteq \\mathsf{NC}^2 \\subseteq \\cdots</math>\nimplies that the entire '''NC''' hierarchy \"collapses\" down to some level ''i''. Thus, there are 2 possibilities:\n\n# <math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathsf{NC}^i \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathsf{NC}^{i+j} \\subset \\cdots \\mathsf{NC}</math>\n# <math>\\mathsf{NC}^1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset \\mathsf{NC}^i = \\cdots = \\mathsf{NC}^{i+j} = \\cdots \\mathsf{NC}</math>\n\nIt is widely believed that (1) is the case, although no proof as to the truth of either statement has yet been discovered.\n\n==Barrington's theorem==\nA '''branching program''' with ''n'' variables of width ''k'' and length ''m'' consists of a sequence of ''m'' instructions. Each of the instructions is a tuple (''i'', ''p'', ''q'') where ''i'' is the index of variable to check (1 &le; ''i'' &le; ''n''), and ''p'' and ''q'' are functions from {1, 2, ..., ''k''} to {1, 2, ..., ''k''}. Numbers 1, 2, ..., ''k'' are called states of the branching program. The program initially starts in state 1, and each instruction (''i'', ''p'', ''q'') changes the state from ''x'' to ''p''(''x'') or ''q''(''x''), depending on whether the ''i''th variable is 0 or 1.\n\nA family of branching programs consists of a branching program with ''n'' variables for each ''n''.\n\nIt is easy to show that every language ''L'' on {0,1} can be recognized by a family of branching programs of width 5 and exponential length, or by a family of exponential width and linear length.\n\nEvery regular language on {0,1} can be recognized by a family of branching programs of constant width and linear number of instructions (since a DFA can be converted to a branching program). '''BWBP''' denotes the class of languages recognizable by a family of branching programs of bounded width and polynomial length.<ref name=CK50>Clote & Kranakis (2002) p.50</ref>\n\n'''Barrington's theorem'''<ref name=Bar89>{{cite journal | zbl=0667.68059 | last=Barrington | first=David A. | journal=J.

The proof uses the [[solvable group|nonsolvability]] of the symmetric group S<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=CK50/>\n\nThe theorem is rather surprising. For instance, it implies that the [[majority function]] can be computed by a family of branching programs of constant width and polynomial size, while intuition might suggest that to achieve polynomial size, one needs a linear number of states.\n\n===Proof of Barrington's theorem===\nA branching program of constant width and polynomial size can be easily converted (via divide-and-conquer) to a circuit in '''NC'''<sup>1</sup>.\n\nConversely, suppose a circuit in '''NC'''<sup>1</sup> is given. Without loss of generality, assume it uses only AND and NOT gates.\n\nLemma 1: If there exists a branching program that sometimes works as a permutation ''P'' and sometimes as a permutation ''Q'', by right-multiplying permutations in the first instruction by \u03b1, and in the last instruction left-multiplying by \u03b2, we can make a circuit of the same length that behaves as \u03b2''P''\u03b1 or \u03b2''Q''\u03b1, respectively.\n\nCall a branching program \u03b1-computing a circuit ''C'' if it works as identity when C's output is 0, and as \u03b1 when C's output is 1.\n\nAs a consequence of Lemma 1 and the fact that all cycles of length 5 are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]], for any two 5-cycles \u03b1, \u03b2, if there exists a branching program \u03b1-computing a circuit ''C'', then there exists a branching program \u03b2-computing the circuit ''C'', of the same length.\n\nLemma 2: There exist 5-cycles \u03b3, \u03b4 such that their [[commutator]] \u03b5=\u03b3\u03b4\u03b3<sup>\u22121</sup>\u03b4<sup>\u22121</sup> is a 5-cycle. For example, \u03b3 = (1 2 3 4 5), \u03b4 = (1 3 5 4 2) giving \u03b5 = (1 3 2 5 4).\n\nWe will now prove Barrington's theorem by induction:\n\nSuppose we have a circuit ''C'' which takes inputs ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>n</sub> and assume that for all subcircuits ''D'' of ''C'' and 5-cycles \u03b1, there exists a branching program \u03b1-computing ''D''. We will show that for all 5-cycles \u03b1, there exists a branching program \u03b1-computing ''C''.\n\n* If the circuit ''C'' simply outputs some input bit ''x<sub>i</sub>'', the branching program we need has just one instruction: checking ''x<sub>i</sub>'''s value (0 or 1), and outputting the identity or \u03b1 (respectively).\n* If the circuit ''C'' outputs \u00ac''A'' for some different circuit ''A'', create a branching program \u03b1<sup>\u22121</sup>-computing ''A'' and then multiply the output of the program by \u03b1. By Lemma 1, we get a branching program for ''A'' outputting the identity or \u03b1, i.e. \u03b1-computing \u00ac''A''=''C''.\n* If the circuit ''C'' outputs ''A''\u2227''B'' for circuits ''A'' and ''B'', join the branching programs that \u03b3-compute ''A'', \u03b4-compute B, \u03b3<sup>\u22121</sup>-compute ''A'', and \u03b4<sup>\u22121</sup>-compute B for a choice of 5-cycles \u03b3 and \u03b4 such that their commutator \u03b5=\u03b3\u03b4\u03b3<sup>\u22121</sup>\u03b4<sup>\u22121</sup> is also a 5-cycle. (The existence of such elements was established in Lemma 2.) If one or both of the circuits outputs 0, the resulting program will be the identity due to cancellation; if both circuits output 1, the resulting program will output the commutator \u03b5. In other words, we get a program \u03b5-computing ''A''\u2227''B''. Because \u03b5 and \u03b1 are two 5-cycles, they are conjugate, and hence there exists a program \u03b1-computing ''A''\u2227''B'' by Lemma 1.\n\nBy assuming the subcircuits have branching programs so that they are \u03b1-computing for all 5-cycles \u03b1\u2208''S''<sub>5</sub>, we have shown ''C'' also has this property, as required.\n\nThe size of the branching program is at most 4<sup>d</sup>, where ''d'' is the depth of the circuit. If the circuit has logarithmic depth, the branching program has polynomial length.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | zbl=1193.68112 | last1=Arora | first1=Sanjeev | authorlink1=Sanjeev Arora | last2=Barak | first2=Boaz | title=Computational complexity.
