Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier e-mailed three of his superior officers and seven other Navy Captains, outlining a plan for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'' was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier e-mailed three of his superior officers and seven other Navy Captains, outlining a plan for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'' was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of 2020 Tipsport Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]].<ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Tipsport Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] and the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic. The current Czech number one, [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], though invited, could not compete due to the contract obligations to [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]].<ref>https://sport.tn.nova.cz/clanek/ceske-sipky-spousti-svou-premier-league-zacina-se-uz-pristi-tyden.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Player\n|-\n|[[File:Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Adam Gawlas.jpg|100px|alt=Adam Gawlas|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Adam Gawlas]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pavel Jirkal.jpg|100px|alt=Pavel Jirkal|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Pavel Jirkal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Ond\u0159ej Kysilka.jpg|100px|alt=Ond\u0159ej Kysilka|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Ond\u0159ej Kysilka]]\n|-\n|[[File:Alexander Ma\u0161ek.jpg|100px|alt=Alexander Ma\u0161ek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Alexander Ma\u0161ek]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal Ondo.jpg|100px|alt=Michal Ondo|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal Ondo]]\n|-\n|[[File:David P\u00edsek.jpg|100px|alt=David P\u00edsek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David P\u00edsek]]\n|-\n|[[File:David Ros\u00ed.jpg|100px|alt=David Ros\u00ed|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David Ros\u00ed]]\n|-\n|[[File:V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal \u0160mejda.jpg|100px|alt=Michal \u0160mejda|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal \u0160mejda]]\n|}\n\n== League stage ==\n\n=== 7.
