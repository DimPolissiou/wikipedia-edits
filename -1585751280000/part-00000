By these, tithes assigned to local churches at [[Llanfihangel Crucorney]], [[Llanddewi Rhydderch]], [[Llanelen]], [[Llanddewi Skirrid]], [[Bryngwyn]] and [[Llanwenarth]] and belonging previously to the Benedictine priory were now given over to the new school. In addition a much richer prize, the tithes of [[Badgeworth]] in [[Gloucestershire]] which had previously belonged to [[Usk]] priory were given over to [[Abergavenny]]'s use. Finally the priory chapel of St. Mary's was to become the new parish church of Abergavenny and so the redundant church of St. John's could be used to house the new school.<ref name=\"VCH277\">Nelmes (1992), p. 3</ref>\n\nThe monies available from these tithes were to be put into trust controlled by \"the bailliffs and commonality\", the forerunners of the [[Town Council]]. It was to provide a [[Free Grammar School]] where [[Latin grammar]] was taught. The new grammar school was named after its benefactor [[Henry VIII]] who also appointed its first headmaster, Richard Oldsworthy. The school when it opened had 26 pupils, all boys aged between 7 and 14.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\n=== The connection with Jesus College, Oxford 1664\u20131887 ===\nThe first century of the school's life was uneventful and change only came as a result of financial mismanagement by the local trustees who had leased out the Badgeworth lands for an undervalued rent: when the 99-year lease came to an end in 1664 it passed to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], who in return provided not only an equal rent but a Fellowship and Scholarship to the college. This began the close connection between the school and the college which not only provided a home for many of its ablest pupils, but also provided the school with its headmasters.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\nAn Act of Parliament in 1760 reorganised the school's governance. Henceforth Jesus College, which had finally gained control of the Gloucester tithes, was responsible for paying the headmaster and his assistant. The Act did have some effect as the old school building was pulled down and replaced on site with the religious tower and fine Georgian master's house which still stands today. By the time of the headmastership of the Reverend William Morgan (1765\u201375) the school was flourishing with some 70-80 boys.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\">Nelmes (1992), p. 4</ref>\n\nChange began in the 1870s. The Headmaster, James Webber, reorganised the curriculum, teaching classics, maths, drawing, French, writing, divinity and arithmetic. He built two new classrooms within the confines of St. John's. By 1878, 73 pupils were being taught by three masters. By 1887 the charity commissioners had prepared a scheme to create a second grade commercial school, on a new site, and it was this proposition that resulted in the severing of the centuries-old links between the school and Jesus College.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\"/>\n\n=== A century of reorganisation 1891\u20131972 ===\nThe first attempt at reorganisation was the 1891 scheme which proposed the creation of a 200 pupil school on a 9-acre site on Pen-y-pound. Building of the school was delayed by many problems and was not completed until 1898 at a cost of \u00a36,945. The school at this time was supposed to be a grammar school taking pupils from all over North Monmouthshire with a curriculum of [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[French language|French]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Algebra]], [[Trigonometry]] and [[Chemistry]].<ref name=\"Nelmes5\">Nelmes (1992), p. 5</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s there was new building with three classrooms, a gym and a library. The Old Boys' Association was founded at a meeting on 7 November 1923 and was soon thriving, with branches of the Abergavenny Society in both [[London]] and [[Aberystwyth]]. By 1930 the school had 150 pupils. The new sciences of Physics and Biology were introduced in the period and the increased importance of metalwork and woodwork  led to the building of a handicrafts room.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nFollowing Butler's Education Act of 1944, [[Monmouthshire County Council]] put forward three options for Abergavenny: boys and girls grammar schools and a secondary modern school; a co-educational grammar school and a secondary modern school or a multilateral school. All three options were to be tried over the next 25 years.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nHarry Newcombe retired as headmaster in 1954. He had managed to gain the school a good reputation as a classical grammar school. The Local Education Authority issued a Statutory Notice on 21 September 1954 to set up a multilateral school of 850, the first stage of which would be the amalgamation of the Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools. Between 1954 and 1956 plans were laid by the authority for an enlarged mixed grammar school and finally provided for a school of 510 pupils with a 60 pupil sixth form.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\">Nelmes (1992), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe new school on the Old Hereford Road site was to be the first phase of the multilateral school, the present Upper school. It was to have an assembly hall, a gym and three floors of classrooms and practical rooms. Building was only begun in 1960 and so the school was not opened until 1963. It was to be made up of a total of 448 pupils from [[King Henry VIII Grammar School|King Henry VIII Boys Grammar School]], the Girls' Intermediate High School, St. John's Private school and the Convent school.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\"/>\n\nThe transition from mixed grammar to comprehensive school was carried out under the headmaster, Russell Edwards. This involved the building of a new school  adjoining the grammar school on the Pen-y-pound site. It also involved the incorporation of Grofield Secondary Modern School which had been established in 1947. Until the new building was completed in 1972 this required the juggling of both staff and pupils between the different sites. The new comprehensive kept the name of its predecessor. The old grammar school became the Upper School while the new building became the Lower School.<ref name=\"Nelmes 1992, p. 7\">Nelmes (1992), p. 7</ref>\n\n=== Recent History 1972\u2013 ===\nThe school with a planned population of 850 pupils when conceived in the 1940s had a peak population of 1825 pupils in 1983.  In 1983 as part of the International Year of Communications the school participated in a satellite quiz with Parramatta High School in New South Wales, Australia, which was celebrating its 70th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramatta-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/documents/31068011/31075365/Eighth%20Decade.pdf|title=A Brief History of Parramatta High School 1980 - 1990|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe school saw a sharp decline in numbers over the course of the 1980s, with 1200 pupils in 1990.

By these, tithes assigned to local churches at [[Llanfihangel Crucorney]], [[Llanddewi Rhydderch]], [[Llanelen]], [[Llanddewi Skirrid]], [[Bryngwyn]] and [[Llanwenarth]] and belonging previously to the Benedictine priory were now given over to the new school. In addition a much richer prize, the tithes of [[Badgeworth]] in [[Gloucestershire]] which had previously belonged to [[Usk]] priory were given over to [[Abergavenny]]'s use. Finally the priory chapel of St. Mary's was to become the new parish church of Abergavenny and so the redundant church of St. John's could be used to house the new school.<ref name=\"VCH277\">Nelmes (1992), p. 3</ref>\n\nThe monies available from these tithes were to be put into trust controlled by \"the bailliffs and commonality\", the forerunners of the [[Town Council]]. It was to provide a [[Free Grammar School]] where [[Latin grammar]] was taught. The new grammar school was named after its benefactor [[Henry VIII]] who also appointed its first headmaster, Richard Oldsworthy. The school when it opened had 26 pupils, all boys aged between 7 and 14.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\n=== The connection with Jesus College, Oxford 1664\u20131887 ===\nThe first century of the school's life was uneventful and change only came as a result of financial mismanagement by the local trustees who had leased out the Badgeworth lands for an undervalued rent: when the 99-year lease came to an end in 1664 it passed to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], who in return provided not only an equal rent but a Fellowship and Scholarship to the college. This began the close connection between the school and the college which not only provided a home for many of its ablest pupils, but also provided the school with its headmasters.<ref name=\"VCH277\"/>\n\nAn Act of Parliament in 1760 reorganised the school's governance. Henceforth Jesus College, which had finally gained control of the Gloucester tithes, was responsible for paying the headmaster and his assistant. The Act did have some effect as the old school building was pulled down and replaced on site with the religious tower and fine Georgian master's house which still stands today. By the time of the headmastership of the Reverend William Morgan (1765\u201375) the school was flourishing with some 70-80 boys.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\">Nelmes (1992), p. 4</ref>\n\nChange began in the 1870s. The Headmaster, James Webber, reorganised the curriculum, teaching classics, maths, drawing, French, writing, divinity and arithmetic. He built two new classrooms within the confines of St. John's. By 1878, 73 pupils were being taught by three masters. By 1887 the charity commissioners had prepared a scheme to create a second grade commercial school, on a new site, and it was this proposition that resulted in the severing of the centuries-old links between the school and Jesus College.<ref name=\"Nelmes4\"/>\n\n=== A century of reorganisation 1891\u20131972 ===\nThe first attempt at reorganisation was the 1891 scheme which proposed the creation of a 200 pupil school on a 9-acre site on Pen-y-pound. Building of the school was delayed by many problems and was not completed until 1898 at a cost of \u00a36,945. The school at this time was supposed to be a grammar school taking pupils from all over North Monmouthshire with a curriculum of [[Latin]], [[English language|English]], [[History]], [[Geography]], [[French language|French]], [[Arithmetic]], [[Algebra]], [[Trigonometry]] and [[Chemistry]].<ref name=\"Nelmes5\">Nelmes (1992), p. 5</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s there was new building with three classrooms, a gym and a library. The Old Boys' Association was founded at a meeting on 7 November 1923 and was soon thriving, with branches of the Abergavenny Society in both [[London]] and [[Aberystwyth]]. By 1930 the school had 150 pupils. The new sciences of Physics and Biology were introduced in the period and the increased importance of metalwork and woodwork  led to the building of a handicrafts room.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nFollowing Butler's Education Act of 1944, [[Monmouthshire County Council]] put forward three options for Abergavenny: boys and girls grammar schools and a secondary modern school; a co-educational grammar school and a secondary modern school or a multilateral school. All three options were to be tried over the next 25 years.<ref name=\"Nelmes5\"/>\n\nHarry Newcombe retired as headmaster in 1954. He had managed to gain the school a good reputation as a classical grammar school. The Local Education Authority issued a Statutory Notice on 21 September 1954 to set up a multilateral school of 850, the first stage of which would be the amalgamation of the Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools. Between 1954 and 1956 plans were laid by the authority for an enlarged mixed grammar school and finally provided for a school of 510 pupils with a 60 pupil sixth form.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\">Nelmes (1992), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe new school on the Old Hereford Road site was to be the first phase of the multilateral school, the present Upper school. It was to have an assembly hall, a gym and three floors of classrooms and practical rooms. Building was only begun in 1960 and so the school was not opened until 1963. It was to be made up of a total of 448 pupils from [[King Henry VIII Grammar School|King Henry VIII Boys Grammar School]], the Girls' Intermediate High School, St. John's Private school and the Convent school.<ref name=\"Nelmes6\"/>\n\nThe transition from mixed grammar to comprehensive school was carried out under the headmaster, Russell Edwards. This involved the building of a new school  adjoining the grammar school on the Pen-y-pound site. It also involved the incorporation of Grofield Secondary Modern School which had been established in 1947. Until the new building was completed in 1972 this required the juggling of both staff and pupils between the different sites. The new comprehensive kept the name of its predecessor. The old grammar school became the Upper School while the new building became the Lower School.<ref name=\"Nelmes 1992, p. 7\">Nelmes (1992), p. 7</ref>\n\n=== Recent History 1972\u2013 ===\nThe school with a planned population of 850 pupils when conceived in the 1940s had a peak population of 1825 pupils in 1983.  In 1983 as part of the International Year of Communications the school participated in a satellite quiz with Parramatta High School in New South Wales, Australia, which was celebrating its 70th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parramatta-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/documents/31068011/31075365/Eighth%20Decade.pdf|title=A Brief History of Parramatta High School 1980 - 1990|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe school saw a sharp decline in numbers over the course of the 1980s, with 1200 pupils in 1990. Pupil numbers have remained broadly consistent over the following two decades.<ref name=\"Nelmes 1992, p. 7\"/>\n\n== School houses ==\nThe school originally had two houses Oppidan and Rustican, from the Latin for Town and Country. As the school grew, a new house structure was created based on four of [[Henry VIII]]'s wives: Aragon ([[Catherine of Aragon]]), Howard ([[Catherine Howard]]), Parr ([[Catherine Parr]]) and Seymour ([[Jane Seymour]]).

Slightly odd, socially inept and occasionally stupid, but with a heart of gold, David frequently misunderstood other characters to comic effect. Bombhead liked to cook. He became somewhat of an apprentice to [[Tony Hutchinson]], and worked in Il Gnosh. He was close friends with Gordon Cunningham, who was a father figure to him. He was devastated when Gordon and his wife, Helen, were killed in a car crash and briefly became a [[Christians|Christian]].\n\nWhen Bombhead's mother died, David suffered a mental breakdown. Unable to accept her death, he lived with her body and continued to act as if she were still alive, doing her dry cleaning and cooking her meals. David's only form of comfort during this time was a recurring hallucination of [[Gordon Cunningham]], who would offer advice and try to convince Bombhead to accept what had happened and ask his friends for help.

Slightly odd, socially inept and occasionally stupid, but with a heart of gold, David frequently misunderstood other characters to comic effect. Bombhead liked to cook. He became somewhat of an apprentice to [[Tony Hutchinson]], and worked in Il Gnosh. He was close friends with Gordon Cunningham, who was a father figure to him. He was devastated when Gordon and his wife, Helen, were killed in a car crash and briefly became a [[Christians|Christian]].\n\nWhen Bombhead's mother died, David suffered a mental breakdown. Unable to accept her death, he lived with her body and continued to act as if she were still alive, doing her dry cleaning and cooking her meals.

He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].

(2003), p. 1.</ref> }} [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 November 1635 \u2013 3 July 1672) was an English [[ornithology|ornithologist]] and [[ichthyology|ichthyologist]], and an early student of [[linguistics]] and [[game studies|games]]. He was born and raised at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire]], the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist [[John Ray]], who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]]. Willughby was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1661, then aged 27.\n\nWillughby, Ray, and others such as [[John Wilkins]] were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of [[Aristotle]] and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.\n\nWillughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of [[pleurisy]] in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and [[invertebrate]]s, the ''Ornithologiae Libri Tres'', ''Historia Piscium'' and ''Historia Insectorum''. The ''Ornithology'' was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of [[List of life sciences|life science]], including their effect on subsequent [[natural history]] writers and their importance in the development of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus's]] [[binomial nomenclature]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Middleton Hall 04.jpg|thumb|The Willughby family home at [[Middleton Hall, Warwickshire|Middleton Hall]]{{efn| Middleton Hall is a grade II* [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings|listed building]].

Furthermore, there were far more known species of fish than there were birds to describe, and Ray was working on his own ''History of Plants''.<ref name= birkhead241/><ref name=jardine303>Jardine (1999) pp. 303\u2013306.</ref> The ''Historia Piscium'' was finally published in Latin in 1686 with a dedication to [[Samuel Pepys]], President of the Royal Society, who had made a generous financial contribution to the project. The book had four sections: an introduction to fish biology; [[cetacea]]ns; [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]]); and [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the last group being further classified by the number and nature of their fins. 187 plates completed the work, their cost making the book a financial disaster for the Royal Society, which had largely funded its publication.<ref name= birkhead241>Birkhead (2018) pp. 241\u2013245.</ref><ref name=jardine307>Jardine (1999) pp. 307\u2013310.</ref><ref name=Kusukawa309>Kusukawa (2016) p. 309.</ref>\n\n===\"Insects\"===\n[[File:Megachile willughbiella male (21626826474).jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby studied this [[Megachile|leaf-cutter bee]], named by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|Kirby]] in 1802 as ''[[Megachile willughbiella]]''.|alt=a bee on a flower]]\nIn the seventeenth century, the term \"insect\" had a much wider meaning than it does today, so the third major book, ''Historia Insectorum'', included many other [[invertebrate]]s, such as worms, spiders and [[millipede]]s. It excluded [[Mollusca|molluscs]], perhaps because [[Martin Lister]], another Fellow of the Royal Society, was writing his own ''Historia Animalium'' that covered that group. Ray's problems with completing this publication were much the same as with the fish book, although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by Sir Thomas Willoughby and the scholar Thomas Man, Sir Thomas having moved into Wollaton Hall in 1687 and regained access to Middleton and his father's papers and possessions.<ref name= birkhead246>Birkhead (2018) pp. 246\u2013251.</ref>\n\nRay died in January 1705, and little happened with the ''Historia Insectorum'' until [[William Derham]] and the Royal Society finally published it in 1710 in Latin, incomplete, unillustrated and under Ray's name only.<ref name= birkhead246/> Ray, however, makes it clear that Willughby did the bulk of the insect research,<ref name=kusukawa336>Kusukawa (2016) pp. 336\u2013337.</ref> including, for example, 20 pages of beetle descriptions.<ref name=ogilvie352>Ogilvie (2016) p. 352.</ref> The book had four sections, starting with an innovative [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification system]] based on  [[metamorphosis]].<ref name= birkhead246/> The second section contained the main species descriptions, followed by Ray's observations of [[lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]] and their caterpillars, and an appendix by Martin Lister on British beetles.<ref name=ogilvie340>Ogilvie (2016) p. 340.</ref> Plates prepared by Sir Thomas Willoughby were not used, and they have now been lost, as have the manuscripts Sir Thomas showed to Ray.<ref name= birkhead246/>\n\n===Games and probability===\n[[File:Playingcardsvanda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Willughby is believed to have studied [[probability]] with respect to card games.

Willughby's own extensive collection included paintings he had bought on his European travels, and he also borrowed pictures owned by friends like Skippon and Sir [[Thomas Browne]]. Many illustrations were taken from previous publications by other writers,<ref name= birkhead216>Birkhead (2018) pp. 216\u2013217.</ref> and some were based on [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow's]] oil-paintings of birds in [[Charles II of England|Charles II's]] [[aviary]] in [[St James's Park]].<ref name= birkhead227>Birkhead (2018) pp. 227\u2013228.</ref><ref name= jackson>Jackson (2006) pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nThe illustrations taken from earlier books were from many sources, particularly the earlier natural histories or ornithologies by [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], [[Giovanni Pietro Olina|Pietro Olina]], [[Georg Marcgrave]] and [[Willem Piso]].<ref name= birkhead2016292>Birkhead ''et al'' (2016) pp. 292\u2013295.</ref> Where feasible, Willughby and Ray compared the available illustrations with life or specimens, or, if that were not possible, against each other, to select the most accurate version for publication.<ref name=flis/> In addition to these authors, sources used for the text included works by [[Carolus Clusius]], [[Adriaen Collaert]], [[Gervase Markham]], [[Juan Eusebio Nieremberg]] and [[Ole Worm]].<ref name= birkhead2016292/><ref name=Gurney>Gurney (1921) pp. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558/page/n220 210\u2013211]</ref> Olina's ''Ucelliera'', at least, seems to have been revisited between the Latin and English editions of the ''Ornithology'', since the later version contains a description of [[territory (animal)|territorial]] behaviour by the [[common nightingale|nightingale]] absent from the earlier work.<ref name= birkhead2011223>Birkhead (2011) p. 223.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:FMIB 46268 Willoughby's Char.jpeg|thumb| Windermere or Willughby's charr, ''[[Salvelinus willughbii]]''|alt=Drawing of a trout-like fish]]\n\nMuch of Willughby's written work has been lost, along with his scientific equipment and most of his collections of items of natural history interest;<ref name =birkhead89>Birkhead (2018) pp. 89\u201393.</ref><ref name=charm>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> what remains is largely owned by the family and housed in the University of Nottingham Middleton archive.<ref name=charm373>Charmantier ''et al'' (2016) p. 373.</ref> The ''Ornithology'' influenced [[Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur|R\u00e9amur]] in organising his great bird collection, and [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson|Brisson]] in the compilation of his own work on the topic.

Founded in 1913, the town is primarily an agricultural, business, and government administration centre serving communities and rural areas within surrounding [[Westlock County]]. It is located {{convert|90|km}} north to north west of the provincial capital [[Edmonton]].\n\n== Geography ==\nWestlock is located approximately {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], Alberta's provincial capital and Canada's [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|sixth largest]] [[census metropolitan area]].  Westlock sits at the junction of [[Alberta Highway 44|Highway 44]] and [[Alberta Highway 18|Highway 18]]. It is surrounded by Westlock County within [[Division No. 13, Alberta|Census Division 13]].\n\nWestlock lies on the [[Prairie Provinces|Alberta plain]], one of the [[Great Plains]].  It lies just to the north of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] [[river basins]], and to the east of the [[Pembina River (Alberta)|Pembina River]], a tributary of the Athabasca.  The town is about {{convert|670|m}} [[above mean sea level]].  Westlock sits within the [[humid continental climate]] zone, on the northern edge of the [[aspen parkland]] belt, a once heavily treed region that was cleared for agriculture at the turn of the 20th century.  It is a relatively fertile region of dark soils.  To the north lies the [[subarctic climate]] zone.  The mean annual precipitation averaged from one meteorological station within the county measured 468 millimetres (mm), based on data from 1980 to 1990. The mean annual temperature averaged 1.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the\nmean monthly temperature reaching a high of 16.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in July, and dropping to a low of -11.4&nbsp;\u00b0C in January.<ref>http://www.10714.com/pdf/rgwa/westlock.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area around Westlock was inhabited by [[First Nations]] people, notably the [[Cree]]. Although the [[fur trade]] had been active in Alberta since 1754 when [[Anthony Henday]] explored the area, the Westlock district was not mentioned in writing until [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] came through in April 1799.\n[[File:Edison, Alberta (1906).jpg|thumb|left|Post office in Edison, 1906]]\n\nWhite settlement did not begin until 1902 at that time centred on a [[rural]] community about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of present-day Westlock. The founding family was named Edgson,<ref>{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Daphne|title=Edison, the Way it was : the history of Edison|year=1980|publisher=Co-Op Press|location=Edmonton|page=25|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=249127}}</ref>  but this was considered too hard to pronounce. [[Edson, Alberta]] already existed, so the site was called Edison by its Irish-Canadian founders, after the American inventor [[Thomas Edison]].  The community in 1912 consisted of a total of no more than 13 buildings: a harness shop, a blacksmith shop, several homes, two churches, and one family living in a tent.  There was also a post office but this was closed in 1911 when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] came to power and fired many [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] from [[Canada Post|the postal service]].<ref>http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=display_original&lg=English&fl=0&rd=117752&ex=471</ref>  In 1911 the railway reached nearby [[Clyde, Alberta|Clyde]] to the east, and in 1912 the ''E.D. & B.C. Railway'' (later the [[Northern Alberta Railway]], now part of [[Canadian National|CN]]) mapped a new townsite where Westlock now stands to the west.  Edison was now caught between the two.  In 1914, the [[Methodist]] church building was picked up and moved down the road to Westlock, an indication of the new settlement's ascendancy over the older one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=record_detail&fl=0&lg=English&ex=471&rd=117778#|title=Century Settlers of the Edison - Westlock Area|author=|date=|website=www.virtualmuseum.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the new town is a [[portmanteau]] of the names of William Westgate and William Lockhart, who owned the property. Westlock was incorporated as a village on 16 March 1916, with a population of 65 residents. The first [[Reeve (Canada)|reeve]] was George MacTavish, and in that same year, the first [[grain elevator]] was built. The first [[bank branch]], the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Merchant's Bank]] opened its doors in 1918. A permanent brick [[school]]house was built in 1925. The [[Sisters of Charity]] of St. Vincent de Paul of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] operated a [[hospital]] out of a former house in 1927, and a purpose-built hospital, the Immaculata, was opened in 1928.  Westlock became a town on 7 January 1947 with a population of 854. That same year, the [[community hall|Memorial Hall]] was also built.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn 1992 the Memorial Hall burned down, later to be replaced. In 1995, the hospital was replaced by the Westlock Health Care Centre, a somewhat controversial decision because several other communities in Alberta were facing hospital closures at the time. In 1997, the old hospital was demolished.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Population history\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = left\n|width       =\n|state       = collapsed\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    = ''Source: [[Statistics Canada]]''<br><ref name=2001census>{{cite web | title=Population and Dwelling Counts, for Canada, Provinces and Territories, and Census Divisions, 2001 and 1996 Censuses \u2013 100% Data (Alberta) | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census01/products/standard/popdwell/Table-CSD-D.cfm?PR=48 | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=2011censusABmunis/><ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|4817\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|4819\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5008\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|4823\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|5101\n}}\nIn the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census of Population]] conducted by [[Statistics Canada]], the Town of Westlock recorded a population of 5,101 living in 2,142 of its 2,333 total private dwellings, a {{percentage|{{#expr:5101-4823}}|4823|1}} change from its 2011 population of 4,823.

The majority of the housing stock (1,630) was constructed before 1986, while 430 units were built between 1986 and 2006.  The average value of owned dwellings was $148,083 (compared to Albertan average of $293,811).\n\n;Families and households\nThere were 2,060 households, of which 1,355 were considered ''census families'' in 2006, with an average of 2.8 persons per family, compared to an Alberta average of 3.0.  The median incomes in 2005 were $41,487 per household and $47,853 per census family, compared to the Alberta median incomes of $63,988 and $73,823 respectively.\n\n;Mother tongue\nIn 2006, there were 3,945 people who claimed English as their [[mother tongue]], 125 who chose French, and 10 who indicated both.  In addition, 600 claimed another language (besides English and French) as a mother tongue.  Every person in town claimed at least a working knowledge of English, 4,450 said it was their only language, 220 said they also knew French, not one person was unilingually Francophone.\n\n;Immigration, citizenship, and generation\nOf the population only 385 were immigrants, the majority of those (300) having arrived in Canada before 1991.  All but 55 people were Canadian citizens.  Most of the Canadian-born residents were from [[immigrant generations|third generation or more]] (2,470), or the second generation (955).\n\n;Mobility status\nThe majority of the population (3,980) had lived in the same house a year earlier, and most of those (2,525) had been in the same house five years earlier as well.\n\n;Aboriginals and visible minorities\nThere were 310 people who had [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal identity]].  There were 145 who reported being [[visible minorities]].\n\n;Educational attainment\nA large minority (1,385) of those residents aged 15 years and older (3,825) had no certificate, diploma, or degree.  1,100 of residents aged 15 years and older has a high school certificate or equivalent.\n\n;Occupation and industry\nThe total workforce was 2,155 people.  The most common occupations were in sales and service (660) and trades, transport and equipment operation (410).  The most common industries were ''other services'' (360), health care and social services (355), and retail trade (320).\n\n;Work location and transportation\nMost people claimed to work in Westlock, and only (255) indicated working in another municipality.  The majority (1,485) of those that had a regular workplace that was not their own home (1,950) commuted to work by private automobile.\n\n;Income\nOf all persons in Westlock aged 15 years and older with income in 2005, 11.0% reported being below the [[Poverty in Canada#Low-income cut-off (LICO)|low income cutoff]] before taxes.  For those under the age of 18, the rate was 10.4% (compared to Alberta averages of 12.2% and 14.2% respectively).\n\n== Economy ==\nThe area around Westlock is primarily [[agriculture in Canada|agricultural]], although there is some [[oilpatch|oil and gas]] activity. The main employers in town include the hotels and inns that cater to oilpatch workers, the [[farm implement]] dealerships, and some small manufacturing such as Wabash Manufacturing - Truck Trailers, and a [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] cement plant. Additionally, Westlock still retains its original purpose as a centre for the [[grain trade]], as CN still accepts grains from the remaining grain elevators, now owned by a [[new generation co-operative]], Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westlock.aghost.net/index.cfm?show=10&mid=8|title=Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD |website=westlock.aghost.net |accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> Also, Westlock is a centre of government as it is the location of Westlock County's [[List of municipal districts in Alberta#Office locations|municipal office]] and home of public<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfstaples.ca/|title=R.F.

As such, Westlock is the central town of the region where rural families do business, send their children to school, and obtain government services. Many rural people retire in the town, and there are several [[Retirement home|old age homes]].\n\nWestlock is too far from Edmonton to serve as a [[bedroom community]] but some people do commute. Of increasing importance to the community since the Second World War has been highway traffic heading to oilfields in [[Northern Alberta]]. Recent retail developments have shifted from the railway era [[downtown]] to larger malls and businesses along the highway. One recent proposal was for a residential development adjoining [[Westlock Airport]] which would allow people to commute to the [[oilsand]] projects in [[Fort McMurray]] and other northern developments, but this has not been started as yet.\n\n== Government ==\nWestlock's current [[House of Commons of Canada|MP]] is [[Arnold Viersen]], representing the riding of [[Peace River-Westlock]]. In the 2015 Canadian Federal Election Westlock became part of the newly formed [[Peace River\u2014Westlock]] federal electoral district. The [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]] who represents Westlock is [[Glenn van Dijken]]. The town's mayor is Ralph Leriger.\n\n== Media ==\n* Newspaper: Westlock News<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westlocknews.com|title=Westlock News, Events, and Community|author=|date=|website=The Westlock News|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> (originally Westlock Witness which began in 1919)\n* FM Radio: [[CKWB-FM|CKWB]] 97.9 \"Real Country\" (previously 97.9 \"the Range\", CFOK 1370, and \"The FOX\")\n\n==Education==\nThe town is within the [[Pembina Hills Public Schools]], which formed in 1995 as a merger of three school districts.<ref name=Ourdivision>{{cite web|url=https://www.phpschools.ca/our-division/|title=Our Division|publisher=[[Pembina Hills Public Schools]]|accessdate=2019-08-25|quote=5310 - 49th Street Barrhead, Alberta T7N 1P3}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[W.A.C.

Founded in 1913, the town is primarily an agricultural, business, and government administration centre serving communities and rural areas within surrounding [[Westlock County]].\n\n== Geography ==\nWestlock is located approximately {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], Alberta's provincial capital and Canada's [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|sixth largest]] [[census metropolitan area]].  Westlock sits at the junction of [[Alberta Highway 44|Highway 44]] and [[Alberta Highway 18|Highway 18]]. It is surrounded by Westlock County within [[Division No. 13, Alberta|Census Division 13]].\n\nWestlock lies on the [[Prairie Provinces|Alberta plain]], one of the [[Great Plains]].  It lies just to the north of the [[continental divide]] between the [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] [[river basins]], and to the east of the [[Pembina River (Alberta)|Pembina River]], a tributary of the Athabasca.  The town is about {{convert|670|m}} [[above mean sea level]].  Westlock sits within the [[humid continental climate]] zone, on the northern edge of the [[aspen parkland]] belt, a once heavily treed region that was cleared for agriculture at the turn of the 20th century.  It is a relatively fertile region of dark soils.  To the north lies the [[subarctic climate]] zone.  The mean annual precipitation averaged from one meteorological station within the county measured 468 millimetres (mm), based on data from 1980 to 1990. The mean annual temperature averaged 1.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the\nmean monthly temperature reaching a high of 16.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in July, and dropping to a low of -11.4&nbsp;\u00b0C in January.<ref>http://www.10714.com/pdf/rgwa/westlock.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area around Westlock was inhabited by [[First Nations]] people, notably the [[Cree]]. Although the [[fur trade]] had been active in Alberta since 1754 when [[Anthony Henday]] explored the area, the Westlock district was not mentioned in writing until [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] came through in April 1799.\n[[File:Edison, Alberta (1906).jpg|thumb|left|Post office in Edison, 1906]]\n\nWhite settlement did not begin until 1902 at that time centred on a [[rural]] community about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of present-day Westlock. The founding family was named Edgson,<ref>{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Daphne|title=Edison, the Way it was : the history of Edison|year=1980|publisher=Co-Op Press|location=Edmonton|page=25|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=249127}}</ref>  but this was considered too hard to pronounce. [[Edson, Alberta]] already existed, so the site was called Edison by its Irish-Canadian founders, after the American inventor [[Thomas Edison]].  The community in 1912 consisted of a total of no more than 13 buildings: a harness shop, a blacksmith shop, several homes, two churches, and one family living in a tent.  There was also a post office but this was closed in 1911 when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] came to power and fired many [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] from [[Canada Post|the postal service]].<ref>http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=display_original&lg=English&fl=0&rd=117752&ex=471</ref>  In 1911 the railway reached nearby [[Clyde, Alberta|Clyde]] to the east, and in 1912 the ''E.D. & B.C. Railway'' (later the [[Northern Alberta Railway]], now part of [[Canadian National|CN]]) mapped a new townsite where Westlock now stands to the west.  Edison was now caught between the two.  In 1914, the [[Methodist]] church building was picked up and moved down the road to Westlock, an indication of the new settlement's ascendancy over the older one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm_v2.php?id=record_detail&fl=0&lg=English&ex=471&rd=117778#|title=Century Settlers of the Edison - Westlock Area|author=|date=|website=www.virtualmuseum.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the new town is a [[portmanteau]] of the names of William Westgate and William Lockhart, who owned the property. Westlock was incorporated as a village on 16 March 1916, with a population of 65 residents. The first [[Reeve (Canada)|reeve]] was George MacTavish, and in that same year, the first [[grain elevator]] was built. The first [[bank branch]], the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Merchant's Bank]] opened its doors in 1918. A permanent brick [[school]]house was built in 1925. The [[Sisters of Charity]] of St. Vincent de Paul of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] operated a [[hospital]] out of a former house in 1927, and a purpose-built hospital, the Immaculata, was opened in 1928.  Westlock became a town on 7 January 1947 with a population of 854. That same year, the [[community hall|Memorial Hall]] was also built.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nIn 1992 the Memorial Hall burned down, later to be replaced. In 1995, the hospital was replaced by the Westlock Health Care Centre, a somewhat controversial decision because several other communities in Alberta were facing hospital closures at the time. In 1997, the old hospital was demolished.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Population history\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = left\n|width       =\n|state       = collapsed\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    = ''Source: [[Statistics Canada]]''<br><ref name=2001census>{{cite web | title=Population and Dwelling Counts, for Canada, Provinces and Territories, and Census Divisions, 2001 and 1996 Censuses \u2013 100% Data (Alberta) | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census01/products/standard/popdwell/Table-CSD-D.cfm?PR=48 | publisher=Statistics Canada | accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=2011censusABmunis/><ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|4817\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|4819\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|5008\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|4823\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|5101\n}}\nIn the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census of Population]] conducted by [[Statistics Canada]], the Town of Westlock recorded a population of 5,101 living in 2,142 of its 2,333 total private dwellings, a {{percentage|{{#expr:5101-4823}}|4823|1}} change from its 2011 population of 4,823.

The majority of the housing stock (1,630) was constructed before 1986, while 430 units were built between 1986 and 2006.  The average value of owned dwellings was $148,083 (compared to Albertan average of $293,811).\n\n;Families and households\nThere were 2,060 households, of which 1,355 were considered ''census families'' in 2006, with an average of 2.8 persons per family, compared to an Alberta average of 3.0.  The median incomes in 2005 were $41,487 per household and $47,853 per census family, compared to the Alberta median incomes of $63,988 and $73,823 respectively.\n\n;Mother tongue\nIn 2006, there were 3,945 people who claimed English as their [[mother tongue]], 125 who chose French, and 10 who indicated both.  In addition, 600 claimed another language (besides English and French) as a mother tongue.  Every person in town claimed at least a working knowledge of English, 4,450 said it was their only language, 220 said they also knew French, not one person was unilingually Francophone.\n\n;Immigration, citizenship, and generation\nOf the population only 385 were immigrants, the majority of those (300) having arrived in Canada before 1991.  All but 55 people were Canadian citizens.  Most of the Canadian-born residents were from [[immigrant generations|third generation or more]] (2,470), or the second generation (955).\n\n;Mobility status\nThe majority of the population (3,980) had lived in the same house a year earlier, and most of those (2,525) had been in the same house five years earlier as well.\n\n;Aboriginals and visible minorities\nThere were 310 people who had [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal identity]].  There were 145 who reported being [[visible minorities]].\n\n;Educational attainment\nA large minority (1,385) of those residents aged 15 years and older (3,825) had no certificate, diploma, or degree.  1,100 of residents aged 15 years and older has a high school certificate or equivalent.\n\n;Occupation and industry\nThe total workforce was 2,155 people.

The most common industries were ''other services'' (360), health care and social services (355), and retail trade (320).\n\n;Work location and transportation\nMost people claimed to work in Westlock, and only (255) indicated working in another municipality.  The majority (1,485) of those that had a regular workplace that was not their own home (1,950) commuted to work by private automobile.\n\n;Income\nOf all persons in Westlock aged 15 years and older with income in 2005, 11.0% reported being below the [[Poverty in Canada#Low-income cut-off (LICO)|low income cutoff]] before taxes.  For those under the age of 18, the rate was 10.4% (compared to Alberta averages of 12.2% and 14.2% respectively).\n\n== Economy ==\nThe area around Westlock is primarily [[agriculture in Canada|agricultural]], although there is some [[oilpatch|oil and gas]] activity. The main employers in town include the hotels and inns that cater to oilpatch workers, the [[farm implement]] dealerships, and some small manufacturing such as Wabash Manufacturing - Truck Trailers, and a [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] cement plant. Additionally, Westlock still retains its original purpose as a centre for the [[grain trade]], as CN still accepts grains from the remaining grain elevators, now owned by a [[new generation co-operative]], Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westlock.aghost.net/index.cfm?show=10&mid=8|title=Westlock Terminals (NGC) LTD |website=westlock.aghost.net |accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> Also, Westlock is a centre of government as it is the location of Westlock County's [[List of municipal districts in Alberta#Office locations|municipal office]] and home of public<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfstaples.ca/|title=R.F.

As such, Westlock is the central town of the region where rural families do business, send their children to school, and obtain government services. Many rural people retire in the town, and there are several [[Retirement home|old age homes]].\n\nWestlock is too far from Edmonton to serve as a [[bedroom community]] but some people do commute. Of increasing importance to the community since the Second World War has been highway traffic heading to oilfields in [[Northern Alberta]]. Recent retail developments have shifted from the railway era [[downtown]] to larger malls and businesses along the highway. One recent proposal was for a residential development adjoining [[Westlock Airport]] which would allow people to commute to the [[oilsand]] projects in [[Fort McMurray]] and other northern developments, but this has not been started as yet.\n\n== Government ==\nWestlock's current [[House of Commons of Canada|MP]] is [[Arnold Viersen]], representing the riding of [[Peace River-Westlock]]. In the 2015 Canadian Federal Election Westlock became part of the newly formed [[Peace River\u2014Westlock]] federal electoral district. The [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]] who represents Westlock is [[Glenn van Dijken]]. The town's mayor is Ralph Leriger.\n\n== Media ==\n* Newspaper: Westlock News<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westlocknews.com|title=Westlock News, Events, and Community|author=|date=|website=The Westlock News|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> (originally Westlock Witness which began in 1919)\n* FM Radio: [[CKWB-FM|CKWB]] 97.9 \"Real Country\" (previously 97.9 \"the Range\", CFOK 1370, and \"The FOX\")\n\n==Education==\nThe town is within the [[Pembina Hills Public Schools]], which formed in 1995 as a merger of three school districts.<ref name=Ourdivision>{{cite web|url=https://www.phpschools.ca/our-division/|title=Our Division|publisher=[[Pembina Hills Public Schools]]|accessdate=2019-08-25|quote=5310 - 49th Street Barrhead, Alberta T7N 1P3}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[W.A.C.

Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.<ref>[http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html Grise Fiord: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228115824/http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |date=2008-12-28 }}</ref> They were told that they would be returned home to Nunavik after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the High Arctic area and the Inuit were forced to stay.

Parts of the interior of southern Nunavik can be reached using several trails which head north from [[Schefferville]].\n[[File:Flag of Nunavik (Thomassie Mangiok).svg|alt=Proposed Nunavik flag|thumb|Proposed Nunavik flag]]\nNunavik has fourteen villages, the vast majority of whose residents are Inuit.<ref name=\"UW\">{{cite web|title=The Nunavik Inuit|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/canada/file/Nunavik%20Inuit-e-v1-1.pdf|website=University of Washington|accessdate=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624050532/http://jsis.washington.edu/canada//file/Nunavik%20Inuit-e-v1-1.pdf|archive-date=24 June 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The principal village and administrative centre in Nunavik is [[Kuujjuaq]], on the southern shore of Ungava Bay; the other villages are [[Inukjuak]] (where the film ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' was shot), [[Salluit]], [[Puvirnituq]], [[Ivujivik]], [[Kangiqsujuaq, Quebec|Kangiqsujuaq]], [[Kangiqsualujjuaq]], [[Kangirsuk]], [[Tasiujaq]], [[Aupaluk]], [[Akulivik]], [[Quaqtaq, Quebec|Quaqtaq]], [[Kuujjuarapik]] and [[Umiujaq]].

They possess distinct genetic signatures in pathways linked to lipid metabolism, allowing them to adjust to higher-fat diets and the extreme temperature of the Canadian Arctic. Geographically isolated populations often develop unique genetic traits that result from their successful adaptation to specific environments. Their closest relatives are the [[Paleo-Eskimos]], a people that inhabited the Arctic before the Inuit. <ref>[https://neurosciencenews.com/genetics-nunavik-inuit-14549/ ''Study finds Nunavik Inuit are genetically unique'']</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Villages/<br />regions<ref>{{cite web|author1=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|title=Ethnic composition of the population, Nunavik (villages), Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec and Qu\u00e9bec|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|language=English|date=2006}}</ref>\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Total<br />population\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Non-<br />aboriginal\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Non-<br />aboriginal\n|-\n| Akulivik\n| 507\n| 500\n| 7\n| 98.6\n| 1.4\n|-\n| Aupaluk\n| 174\n| n.a.\u00b2\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Inukjuak\n| 1,597\n| 1,340\n| 85\n| 83.9\n| 5.3\n|- \n| Ivujivik\n| 349\n| 340\n| 0\n| 97.4\n| 0.0\n|- \n| Kangiqsualujjuaq\n| 735\n| 705\n| 30\n| 95.9\n| 4.1\n|-\n| Kangirsujuaq\n| 605\n| 560\n| 50\n| 92.6\n| 8.3\n|-\n| Kangirsuk\n| 466\n| 425\n| 45\n| 91.2\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Kuujjuaq\n| 2,132\n| 1,635\n| 460\n| 76.7\n| 21.6\n|-\n| Kuujjuarapik\n| 568\n| 465\n| 55\n| 81.9\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Puvirnituq\n| 1,457\n| 1,385\n| 40\n| 95.1\n| 2.7\n|-\n| Quaqtaq\n| 315\n| 300\n| 10\n| 95.2\n| 3.2\n|-\n| Salluit\n| 1,241\n| 1,150\n| 85\n| 92.7\n| 6.8\n|-\n| Tasiujaq\n| 248\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Umiujaq\n| 390\n| 375\n| 10\n| 96.2\n| 2.6\n|-\n| Nunavik\n| 10,784\n| 9,565\n| 920\n| 88.7\n| 8.5\n|-\n| Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec\n| 39,550\n| 9,625\n| 16,020\n| 24.3\n| 40.5\n|-\n| Qu\u00e9bec\n| 7,435,905\n| 10,950\n| 7,327,475\n| 0.1\n| 98.5\n|-\n|}\n\n===Language===\nThe following table does not include Canada's official languages of French and English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!colspan=3| Mother tongue, 2011 NHS Survey<ref>{{cite web|author1=National Household Survey (NHS)|title=Non-official language, Nunavik and communities|url=https://www.nunivaat.org/documents/20150422/2015-04-22-05.pdf|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=English|date=2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Rank\n!align=\"left\"| Language\n!Population\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|1.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Inuktitut\n| 10 870\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|2.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Spanish\n| 80\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|3.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Cree languages\n| 70\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|4.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other Aboriginal language\n| 35\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|5.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other non-Aboriginal language\n| 15\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Arabic\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Creoles\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|German\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Portuguese\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Niger-Congo languages\n|10\n|}\n\n==Economy==\nNunavik is rich in mineral deposits where [[Raglan Mine]], situated near Salluit, is one of the largest mines in the region. It is linked by all-weather roads to an airstrip at [[Kattiniq/Donaldson Airport]] and to the concentrate, storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay. Production began at the mine in 1997. The current mine life is estimated at more than 30 years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nBecause the site is situated in the subarctic [[permafrost]] region, it requires special construction and mining techniques to protect the fragile permafrost and to address other environmental issues. The average annual temperature is {{convert|-10|C}} with an average ambient temperature underground of {{convert|-15|C}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} There are plans to increase production at a new mine in Raglan South.\n\n==Arts and culture==\nThe villages of Nunavik are populated predominately by Inuit. Much like their Nunavummiut neighbours to the North, the Nunavimmiut carve sculptures from soapstone and eat primarily caribou and fish. On clear nights, the aurora is often visible, and outdoors activities are abundant in this region. \n\n==Government==\nNunavik, along with the Quebec portion of the James Bay region (or Jam\u00e9sie in French), is part of the administrative region of Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec. The [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]] of 1978 led to greater political autonomy for most of the Nunavik region with the founding of the [[Kativik Regional Government]]. All inhabitants of the 14 northern villages, both Inuit and non-Inuit, vote in regional elections. The Kativik Regional Government is financed by the [[Government of Quebec]] (50%), the [[Government of Canada]] (25%), and local revenues (25%).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}The Agreement also led to the creation of the [[Kativik Regional Police Force]], which provides police services in the [[Kativik Regional Government|Kativik]] region since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krpf.ca/en/about/general-information|title=General Information|last=KRPF|website=Home|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Makivik Corporation]], headquartered in Kuujjuaq, represents the Inuit of Northern Quebec in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada. They are seeking greater political autonomy for the region and have recently negotiated an agreement defining their traditional rights to use the resources of the offshore islands of Nunavik, all of which are part of Nunavut.\n\nThe Cree village of Whapmagoostui, which forms an enclave on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay near the northern village of Kuujjuarapik, is part of the Cree Regional Authority, which itself has been incorporated into the [[Grand Council of the Crees|Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee)]].  The [[Naskapi]] Nation of Kawawachikamach, of the C\u00f4te-Nord region to the south of Nunavik, owns an exclusive hunting and trapping area in southern Nunavik and is represented in the Kativik Regional Government.\n\n===Regional Government of Nunavik===\nThe governments of Quebec and Canada and Nunavik had negotiated a proposal to establish a Regional Government of Nunavik. This is in part a recognition of the region's political distinctiveness, having a different language, culture, climate and voting pattern than the rest of the province of Quebec, as well as part of the overall trend towards [[devolution]] of Canada's arctic territories. While Quebec and Canada would still maintain full jurisdiction over the area, the Nunavik government will have an elected parliamentary-style council and cabinet, and a public service funded by the province and responsible for delivering certain social services such as education and health. The regional government would have also had rights to the region's natural resources, including royalties from the various mines in the region.  This proposal was rejected by about 66% of voters in a referendum in 2011.  It is expected that negotiations will continue in the future to work to establish a more autonomous government for Nunavik in the future.\n\nThe government will be based on territory, not ethnicity, so that all people residing in Nunavik can be full participants.<ref>{{cite web |author=Makivik Corporation |author2=Government of Quebec |author3=Government of Canada |title=Agreement in Principle Concerning the Amalgamation of Certain Public Institutions and Creation of the Nunavik Regional Government |url=http://www.nunavikgovernment.ca/en/documents/AIP%20-%20EP%20trilingual%20version.pdf |publisher=The Nunavik Regional Government negotiations website |page=8 |language=French, Inuktitut, English |date=11 July 2007 |quote=The Nunavik Regional Government shall be a public institution for all Nunavik residents, notably regarding the access to services and the eligibility for positions and responsibilities. |accessdate=23 September 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Existing government structures, such as the Kativik Regional Government, Kativik School Board, and Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services, will be folded into the new regional government.\n\nThe Quebec government has also expressed a desire to add an additional seat to the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] to represent Nunavik, despite the region's small population. Currently, Nunavik is part of the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Ungava (electoral district)|Ungava]], its residents making up just under half of the riding's population. As a riding, Nunavik would be the second least populous in Quebec, slightly more populous than [[\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine (provincial electoral district)|\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine]], which is able to exist as a separate riding under an exception to the laws on population distribution by riding.<ref>Chouinard, Tommy.

Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.<ref>[http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html Grise Fiord: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228115824/http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |date=2008-12-28 }}</ref> They were told that they would be returned home to Nunavik after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the High Arctic area and the Inuit were forced to stay.

Nunavik shares a border with the [[C\u00f4te-Nord]] region of Quebec and the [[Labrador]] region of the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The [[Ungava Peninsula]] forms the northern two-thirds of the region. There are no road links between Nunavik and southern Quebec, although the [[Trans-Taiga Road]] of the [[Jam\u00e9sie]] region ends near the [[55th parallel north|55th parallel]] on the [[Caniapiscau Reservoir]], several hundred kilometers south of Kuujjuaq. There is a year-round air link to all villages and seasonal shipping in the summer and autumn.

They possess distinct genetic signatures in pathways linked to lipid metabolism, allowing them to adjust to higher-fat diets and the extreme temperature of the Canadian Arctic. Geographically isolated populations often develop unique genetic traits that result from their successful adaptation to specific environments. Their closest relatives are the [[Paleo-Eskimos]], a people that inhabited the Arctic before the Inuit. <ref>[https://neurosciencenews.com/genetics-nunavik-inuit-14549/ ''Study finds Nunavik Inuit are genetically unique'']</ref> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Villages/<br />regions<ref>{{cite web|author1=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|title=Ethnic composition of the population, Nunavik (villages), Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec and Qu\u00e9bec|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Canada Research Chair on Comparative Aboriginal Condition|language=English|date=2006}}</ref>\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Total<br />population\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| Non-<br />aboriginal\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Inuit\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1| (%) Non-<br />aboriginal\n|-\n| Akulivik\n| 507\n| 500\n| 7\n| 98.6\n| 1.4\n|-\n| Aupaluk\n| 174\n| n.a.\u00b2\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Inukjuak\n| 1,597\n| 1,340\n| 85\n| 83.9\n| 5.3\n|- \n| Ivujivik\n| 349\n| 340\n| 0\n| 97.4\n| 0.0\n|- \n| Kangiqsualujjuaq\n| 735\n| 705\n| 30\n| 95.9\n| 4.1\n|-\n| Kangirsujuaq\n| 605\n| 560\n| 50\n| 92.6\n| 8.3\n|-\n| Kangirsuk\n| 466\n| 425\n| 45\n| 91.2\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Kuujjuaq\n| 2,132\n| 1,635\n| 460\n| 76.7\n| 21.6\n|-\n| Kuujjuarapik\n| 568\n| 465\n| 55\n| 81.9\n| 9.7\n|-\n| Puvirnituq\n| 1,457\n| 1,385\n| 40\n| 95.1\n| 2.7\n|-\n| Quaqtaq\n| 315\n| 300\n| 10\n| 95.2\n| 3.2\n|-\n| Salluit\n| 1,241\n| 1,150\n| 85\n| 92.7\n| 6.8\n|-\n| Tasiujaq\n| 248\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n| n.a.\n|-\n| Umiujaq\n| 390\n| 375\n| 10\n| 96.2\n| 2.6\n|-\n| Nunavik\n| 10,784\n| 9,565\n| 920\n| 88.7\n| 8.5\n|-\n| Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec\n| 39,550\n| 9,625\n| 16,020\n| 24.3\n| 40.5\n|-\n| Qu\u00e9bec\n| 7,435,905\n| 10,950\n| 7,327,475\n| 0.1\n| 98.5\n|-\n|}\n\n===Language===\nThe following table does not include Canada's official languages of French and English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!colspan=3| Mother tongue, 2011 NHS Survey<ref>{{cite web|author1=National Household Survey (NHS)|title=Non-official language, Nunavik and communities|url=https://www.nunivaat.org/documents/20150422/2015-04-22-05.pdf|website=Nunivaat|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=English|date=2011}}</ref>\n|-\n!Rank\n!align=\"left\"| Language\n!Population\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|1.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Inuktitut\n| 10 870\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|2.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Spanish\n| 80\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|3.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Cree languages\n| 70\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|4.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other Aboriginal language\n| 35\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|5.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other non-Aboriginal language\n| 15\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Arabic\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Creoles\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|German\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Portuguese\n|10\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|6.\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Niger-Congo languages\n|10\n|}\n\n==Economy==\nNunavik is rich in mineral deposits where [[Raglan Mine]], situated near Salluit, is one of the largest mines in the region. It is linked by all-weather roads to an airstrip at [[Kattiniq/Donaldson Airport]] and to the concentrate, storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay. Production began at the mine in 1997. The current mine life is estimated at more than 30 years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nBecause the site is situated in the subarctic [[permafrost]] region, it requires special construction and mining techniques to protect the fragile permafrost and to address other environmental issues. The average annual temperature is {{convert|-10|C}} with an average ambient temperature underground of {{convert|-15|C}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} There are plans to increase production at a new mine in Raglan South.\n\n==Arts and culture==\nThe villages of Nunavik are populated predominately by Inuit. Much like their Nunavummiut neighbours to the North, the Nunavimmiut carve sculptures from soapstone and eat primarily caribou and fish. On clear nights, the aurora is often visible, and outdoors activities are abundant in this region. \n\n==Government==\nNunavik, along with the Quebec portion of the James Bay region (or Jam\u00e9sie in French), is part of the administrative region of Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec. The [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]] of 1978 led to greater political autonomy for most of the Nunavik region with the founding of the [[Kativik Regional Government]]. All inhabitants of the 14 northern villages, both Inuit and non-Inuit, vote in regional elections. The Kativik Regional Government is financed by the [[Government of Quebec]] (50%), the [[Government of Canada]] (25%), and local revenues (25%).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}The Agreement also led to the creation of the [[Kativik Regional Police Force]], which provides police services in the [[Kativik Regional Government|Kativik]] region since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krpf.ca/en/about/general-information|title=General Information|last=KRPF|website=Home|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Makivik Corporation]], headquartered in Kuujjuaq, represents the Inuit of Northern Quebec in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada. They are seeking greater political autonomy for the region and have recently negotiated an agreement defining their traditional rights to use the resources of the offshore islands of Nunavik, all of which are part of Nunavut.\n\nThe Cree village of Whapmagoostui, which forms an enclave on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay near the northern village of Kuujjuarapik, is part of the Cree Regional Authority, which itself has been incorporated into the [[Grand Council of the Crees|Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee)]].  The [[Naskapi]] Nation of Kawawachikamach, of the C\u00f4te-Nord region to the south of Nunavik, owns an exclusive hunting and trapping area in southern Nunavik and is represented in the Kativik Regional Government.\n\n===Regional Government of Nunavik===\nThe governments of Quebec and Canada and Nunavik had negotiated a proposal to establish a Regional Government of Nunavik. This is in part a recognition of the region's political distinctiveness, having a different language, culture, climate and voting pattern than the rest of the province of Quebec, as well as part of the overall trend towards [[devolution]] of Canada's arctic territories. While Quebec and Canada would still maintain full jurisdiction over the area, the Nunavik government will have an elected parliamentary-style council and cabinet, and a public service funded by the province and responsible for delivering certain social services such as education and health. The regional government would have also had rights to the region's natural resources, including royalties from the various mines in the region.  This proposal was rejected by about 66% of voters in a referendum in 2011.  It is expected that negotiations will continue in the future to work to establish a more autonomous government for Nunavik in the future.\n\nThe government will be based on territory, not ethnicity, so that all people residing in Nunavik can be full participants.<ref>{{cite web |author=Makivik Corporation |author2=Government of Quebec |author3=Government of Canada |title=Agreement in Principle Concerning the Amalgamation of Certain Public Institutions and Creation of the Nunavik Regional Government |url=http://www.nunavikgovernment.ca/en/documents/AIP%20-%20EP%20trilingual%20version.pdf |publisher=The Nunavik Regional Government negotiations website |page=8 |language=French, Inuktitut, English |date=11 July 2007 |quote=The Nunavik Regional Government shall be a public institution for all Nunavik residents, notably regarding the access to services and the eligibility for positions and responsibilities. |accessdate=23 September 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Existing government structures, such as the Kativik Regional Government, Kativik School Board, and Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services, will be folded into the new regional government.\n\nThe Quebec government has also expressed a desire to add an additional seat to the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] to represent Nunavik, despite the region's small population. Currently, Nunavik is part of the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Ungava (electoral district)|Ungava]], its residents making up just under half of the riding's population. As a riding, Nunavik would be the second least populous in Quebec, slightly more populous than [[\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine (provincial electoral district)|\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine]], which is able to exist as a separate riding under an exception to the laws on population distribution by riding.<ref>Chouinard, Tommy.

Some of its research institutes include the [[National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev]], the Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, the [[Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research]] with the [[Albert Katz International School for Desert Studies]], and the Ben-Gurion Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism.\n\n== History ==\nBen-Gurion University was established in 1969 as the University of the Negev with the aim of promoting the development of the Negev desert that comprises more than sixty percent of Israel. The University was later renamed after Israel's founder and first prime minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], who believed that the future of the country lay in this region. After Ben-Gurion's death in 1973, the University was renamed Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The Presidents of the university have been [[Moshe Prywes]] (1973-75), [[Yosef Tekoah]] (1975-81), [[Shlomo Gazit]] (1982-85), [[Chaim Elata]] (1985-90), [[Avishay Braverman]] (1990-2006), [[Rivka Carmi]] (2006-18), and [[Daniel Chamovitz]] (2018-present).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/management/Former_Presidents.aspx |title=Ben-Gurion University of the Negev - Former Presidents |publisher=In.bgu.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/management/president.aspx |title=Ben-Gurion University of the Negev - BGU President - Prof. Daniel Chamovitz |publisher=In.bgu.ac.il |date=2019-01-01 |accessdate=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, long-time friends, the late Dr. Howard and Lottie Marcus bequeathed a legacy gift of $400 million to Ben-Gurion University.

Some of its research institutes include the [[National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev]], the Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, the [[Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research]] with the [[Albert Katz International School for Desert Studies]], and the Ben-Gurion Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism.\n\n== History ==\nBen-Gurion University was established in 1969 as the University of the Negev with the aim of promoting the development of the Negev desert that comprises more than sixty percent of Israel. The University was later renamed after Israel's founder and first prime minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], who believed that the future of the country lay in this region. After Ben-Gurion's death in 1973, the University was renamed Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The Presidents of the university have been [[Moshe Prywes]] (1973-75), [[Yosef Tekoah]] (1975-81), [[Shlomo Gazit]] (1982-85), [[Chaim Elata]] (1985-90), [[Avishay Braverman]] (1990-2006), [[Rivka Carmi]] (2006-18), and [[Daniel Chamovitz]] (2018-present).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/management/Former_Presidents.aspx |title=Ben-Gurion University of the Negev - Former Presidents |publisher=In.bgu.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/management/president.aspx |title=Ben-Gurion University of the Negev - BGU President - Prof. Daniel Chamovitz |publisher=In.bgu.ac.il |date=2019-01-01 |accessdate=2020-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, long-time friends, the late Dr. Howard and Lottie Marcus bequeathed a legacy gift of $400 million to Ben-Gurion University.

He was the youngest of nine children. Strassmann grew up in [[Dusseldorf]]. Strassmann developed an interest in chemistry at a young age and conducted chemistry experiments in his parents' home. His family was of modest means, and his father died at a young age, making the family's financial problems worse. Financial considerations limited Strassmann's initial choices of where to pursue his [[higher education]] and what subjects they should be.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> \n\nStrassmann began his formal chemistry studies in 1920 at the [[Technical University of Hannover]], supporting himself financially by working as a tutor for other students. He received a diploma in [[chemical engineering]] in 1924, and his [[Ph.D.|doctorate]] in [[physical chemistry]] in 1929.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/><ref name=\"Friedlander\"/> His doctoral research was on the solubility and reactivity of iodine in [[carbonic acid]] in the gas phase.
