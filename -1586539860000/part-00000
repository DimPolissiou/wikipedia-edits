On June 5, 2018, Intel released a limited-edition CPU celebrating the anniversary of the  Intel 8086, called the Intel Core i7-8086K.<ref name=\"Intel\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1972, Intel launched the [[Intel 8008|8008]], the first 8-bit microprocessor.<ref group=\"note\" >using enhancement load [[PMOS logic]] (requiring 14&nbsp;[[Volt|V]], achieving TTL compatibility by having V<sub>CC</sub> at +5&nbsp;V and V<sub>DD</sub> at \u22129&nbsp;V).</ref> It implemented an [[instruction set]] designed by [[Datapoint]] corporation with programmable [[Computer terminal|CRT terminals]] in mind, which also proved to be fairly general-purpose. The device needed several additional [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s to produce a functional computer, in part due to it being packaged in a small 18-pin \"memory package\", which ruled out the use of a separate address bus (Intel was primarily a [[DRAM]] manufacturer at the time).\n\nTwo years later, Intel launched the [[Intel 8080|8080]],<ref group=\"note\">Using non-saturated enhancement-load [[NMOS logic]] (demanding a higher gate voltage for the load-transistor gates).</ref> employing the new 40-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIL package]]s originally developed for [[calculator]] ICs to enable a separate address bus. It has an extended instruction set that is [[source-compatible]] (not [[binary compatible]]) with the 8008<ref>{{Cite web\n  |website=CPU World\n  |title=8080 family\n  |url=http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8080/\n}}</ref> and also includes some [[16-bit]] instructions to make programming easier. The 8080 device, was eventually replaced by the [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-load]]-based [[Intel 8085|8085]] (1977), which sufficed with a single +5&nbsp;V power supply instead of the three different operating voltages of earlier chips.<ref group=\"note\">Made possible with depletion-load nMOS logic (the 8085 was later made using HMOS processing, just like the 8086).</ref> Other well known 8-bit microprocessors that emerged during these years are [[Motorola 6800]] (1974), [[PIC microcontroller|General Instrument PIC16X]] (1975), [[MOS Technology 6502]] (1975), [[Zilog Z80]] (1976), and [[Motorola 6809]] (1978).\n\n===The first x86 design===\n[[File:Intel 8086 CPU Die.JPG|thumb|Intel 8086 CPU die image]]\nThe 8086 project started in May 1976 and was originally intended as a temporary substitute for the ambitious and delayed [[iAPX 432]] project. It was an attempt to draw attention from the less-delayed 16- and 32-bit processors of other manufacturers (such as [[Motorola]], [[Zilog]], and [[National Semiconductor]]) and at the same time to counter the threat from the [[Zilog Z80]] (designed by former Intel employees), which became very successful. Both the architecture and the physical chip were therefore developed rather quickly by a small group of people, and using the same basic [[microarchitecture]] elements and physical implementation techniques as employed for the slightly older [[Intel 8085|8085]] (and for which the 8086 also would function as a continuation).\n\nMarketed as [[Source code compatibility|source compatible]],<ref name=\"Scanlon_1988\"/> the 8086 was designed to allow [[assembly language]] for the 8008{{fact|date=January 2020|reason=Any example for this?}}, 8080, or 8085 to be [[Assembly language translator|automatically converted]] into equivalent (suboptimal) 8086 source code, with little or no hand-editing. The programming model and instruction set is (loosely) based on the 8080 in order to make this possible. However, the 8086 design was expanded to support full 16-bit processing, instead of the fairly limited 16-bit capabilities of the 8080 and 8085.\n\nNew kinds of instructions were added as well; full support for signed integers, base+offset addressing, and self-repeating operations were akin to the [[Z80]] design<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/146957/birth_of_a_standard_the_intel_8086_microprocessor.html Birth of a Standard: The Intel 8086 Microprocessor. Thirty years ago, Intel released the 8086 processor, introducing the x86 architecture that underlies every PC \u2014 Windows, Mac, or Linux \u2014 produced today], PC World, June 17, 2008</ref> but were all made slightly more general in the 8086. Instructions directly supporting [[nested function|nested]] [[ALGOL]]-family languages such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[PL/M]] were also added. According to principal architect [[Stephen P. Morse]], this was a result of a more software-centric approach than in the design of earlier Intel processors (the designers had experience working with compiler implementations). Other enhancements included [[microcode]]d multiply and divide instructions and a bus structure better adapted to future coprocessors (such as [[Intel 8087|8087]] and [[Intel 8089|8089]]) and multiprocessor systems.\n\nThe first revision of the instruction set and high level architecture was ready after about three months,<ref group=\"note\" >Rev.0 of the instruction set and architecture was ready in about three months, according to Morse.</ref> and as almost no CAD tools were used, four engineers and 12&nbsp;layout people were simultaneously working on the chip.<ref group=\"note\" >Using [[rubylith]], light boards, rulers, electric erasers, and a [[digitizer]] (according to Jenny Hernandez, member of the 8086 design team, in a statement made on Intel's webpage for its 25th birthday).</ref> The 8086 took a little more than two years from idea to working product, which was considered rather fast for a complex design in 1976\u20131978.\n\nThe 8086 was sequenced<ref group=\"note\" >8086 used less microcode than many competitors' designs, such as the MC68000 and others</ref> using a mixture of [[random logic]]<ref>Randall L. Geiger, Phillip E. Allen, Noel R.

It was soon moved to a new refined nMOS manufacturing process called [[HMOS]] (for High performance MOS) that Intel originally developed for manufacturing of fast [[static RAM]] products.<ref group=\"note\" >Fast static RAMs in MOS technology (as fast as bipolar RAMs) was an important product for Intel during this period.</ref> This was followed by HMOS-II, HMOS-III versions, and, eventually, a fully static [[CMOS]] version for battery powered devices, manufactured using Intel's [[CHMOS]] processes.<ref group=\"note\" >CHMOS is Intel's name for CMOS circuits manufactured using processing steps very similar to [[HMOS]].</ref> The original chip measured 33&nbsp;mm\u00b2 and minimum feature size was 3.2&nbsp;\u03bcm.\n\nThe architecture was defined by [[Stephen P. Morse]] with some help and assistance by Bruce Ravenel (the architect of the 8087) in refining the final revisions. Logic designer Jim McKevitt and John Bayliss were the lead engineers of the hardware-level development team<ref group=\"note\" >Other members of the design team were Peter A.Stoll and Jenny Hernandez.</ref> and Bill Pohlman the manager for the project. The legacy of the 8086 is enduring in the basic instruction set of today's personal computers and servers; the 8086 also lent its last two digits to later extended versions of the design, such as the [[Intel 286]] and the [[Intel 386]], all of which eventually became known as the [[x86]] family. (Another reference is that the [[PCI Configuration Space|PCI Vendor ID]] for Intel devices is 8086<sub>h</sub>.)\n\n==Details==\n[[File:Intel 8086 pinout.svg|thumb|300px|The 8086 pin assignments in min and max mode]]\n\n===Buses and operation===\nAll internal registers, as well as internal and external data buses, are 16&nbsp;bits wide, which firmly established the \"16-bit microprocessor\" identity of the 8086. A 20-bit external address bus provides a 1&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] physical address space (2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576). This address space is addressed by means of internal memory \"segmentation\". The data bus is [[multiplexed]] with the address bus in order to fit all of the control lines into a standard 40-pin [[dual in-line package]]. It provides a 16-bit I/O address bus, supporting 64&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of separate I/O space. The maximum linear address space is limited to 64&nbsp;KB, simply because internal address/index registers are only 16&nbsp;bits wide. Programming over 64&nbsp;KB memory boundaries involves adjusting the segment registers (see below); this difficulty existed until the [[80386]] architecture introduced wider (32-bit) registers (the memory management hardware in the [[80286]] did not help in this regard, as its registers are still only 16 bits wide).\n\n===Hardware modes===\nSome of the control pins, which carry essential signals for all external operations, have more than one function depending upon whether the device is operated in ''min'' or ''max'' mode. The former mode is intended for small single-processor systems, while the latter is for medium or large systems using more than one processor (a kind of multiprocessor mode). Maximum mode is required when using an 8087 or 8089 coprocessor. The voltage on pin 33 (MN/{{overline|MX}}) determine the mode. Changing the state of pin 33 changes the function of certain other pins, most of which have to do with how the CPU handles the (local) bus. <ref group=\"note\" >The IBM PC and PC/XT use an Intel 8088 running in maximum mode, which allows the CPU to work with an optional 8087 coprocessor installed in the math coprocessor socket on the PC or PC/XT mainboard. (The PC and PC/XT may require maximum mode for other reasons, such as perhaps to support the DMA controller.)</ref> The mode is usually hardwired into the circuit and therefore cannot be changed by software. The workings of these modes are described in terms of timing diagrams in Intel datasheets and manuals. In minimum mode, all control signals are generated by the 8086 itself.\n\n===Registers and instructions===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:75%;\"\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |''Intel 8086 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

color:black\" | Flags\n|}\n|}\nThe 8086 has eight more or less general 16-bit [[processor register|registers]] (including the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack pointer]] but excluding the instruction pointer, flag register and segment registers). Four of them, AX, BX, CX, DX, can also be accessed as twice as many 8-bit registers (see figure) while the other four, SI, DI, BP, SP, are 16-bit only.\n\nDue to a compact encoding inspired by 8-bit processors, most instructions are one-address or two-address operations, which means that the result is stored in one of the operands. At most one of the operands can be in memory, but this memory operand can also be the ''destination'', while the other operand, the ''source'', can be either ''register'' or ''immediate''. A single memory location can also often be used as both ''source'' and ''destination'' which, among other factors, further contributes to a [[code density]] comparable to (and often better than) most eight-bit machines at the time.\n\nThe degree of generality of most registers are much greater than in the 8080 or 8085. However, 8086 registers were more specialized than in most contemporary [[minicomputer]]s and are also used implicitly by some instructions. While perfectly sensible for the assembly programmer, this makes register allocation for compilers more complicated compared to more orthogonal 16-bit and 32-bit processors of the time such as the [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[68000]], [[32016]] etc. On the other hand, being more regular than the rather minimalistic but ubiquitous 8-bit microprocessors such as the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], [[Motorola 6800|6800]], [[6809]], [[Intel 8085|8085]], [[MCS-48]], [[Intel 8051|8051]], and other contemporary accumulator-based machines, it is significantly easier to construct an efficient [[code generator]] for the 8086 architecture.\n\nAnother factor for this is that the 8086 also introduced some new instructions (not present in the 8080 and 8085) to better support stack-based high-level programming languages such as Pascal and [[PL/M]]; some of the more useful instructions are '''push''' ''mem-op'', and '''ret''' ''size'', supporting the \"Pascal [[calling convention]]\" directly. (Several others, such as '''push'''&nbsp;''immed'' and '''enter''', were added in the subsequent 80186, 80286, and 80386 processors.)\n\nA 64&nbsp;KB (one segment) [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] growing towards lower addresses is supported in [[computer hardware|hardware]]; 16-bit words are pushed onto the stack, and the top of the stack is pointed to by SS:SP. There are 256&nbsp;[[interrupt]]s, which can be invoked by both hardware and software. The interrupts can cascade, using the stack to store the [[return address (computing)|return address]]es.\n\nThe 8086 has 64&nbsp;K of 8-bit (or alternatively 32&nbsp;K of 16-bit word) [[I/O port]] space.\n\n===Flags===\nThe 8086 has a 16-bit [[status register|flags register]]. Nine of these condition code flags are active, and indicate the current state of the processor: [[Carry flag]] (CF), [[Parity flag]] (PF), [[Auxiliary flag|Auxiliary carry flag]] (AF), [[Zero flag]] (ZF), [[Sign flag]] (SF), [[Trap flag]] (TF), [[IF (x86 flag)|Interrupt flag]] (IF), [[Direction flag]] (DF), and [[Overflow flag]] (OF).\nAlso referred to as the status word, the layout of the flags register is as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|title=IAPX 86, 88, 186, and 188 user's manual : programmer's reference|others=Intel Corporation.|isbn=978-0835930352|location=Santa Clara, CA|oclc=11091251}}</ref>{{Rp|3\u20135}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Rather than concatenating the segment register with the address register, as in most processors whose address space exceeds their register size, the 8086 shifts the 16-bit segment only four bits left before adding it to the 16-bit offset (16\u00d7segment + offset), therefore producing a 20-bit external (or effective or physical) address from the 32-bit segment:offset pair. As a result, each external address can be referred to by 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 different segment:offset pairs.\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:5em\"\n|-\n| <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#DED\">0110 1000 1000 0111</tt><tt>&nbsp;0000</tt>\n| '''Segment''',\n| 16 bits, shifted 4 bits left (or multiplied by 0x10)\n|-\n| <tt>+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#DDF\">0011 0100 1010 1001</tt>\n| '''Offset''',\n| 16 bits\n|- style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"\n| <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>\n|\n|-\n| <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#FDF\">0110 1011 1101 0001 1001</tt>\n| '''Address''',\n| 20 bits\n|}\n\nAlthough considered complicated and cumbersome by many programmers, this scheme also has advantages; a small program (less than 64&nbsp;KB) can be loaded starting at a fixed offset (such as 0000) in its own segment, avoiding the need for [[Relocation (computing)|relocation]], with at most 15&nbsp;bytes of alignment waste.\n\nCompilers for the 8086 family commonly support two types of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]], ''near'' and ''far''. Near pointers are 16-bit offsets implicitly associated with the program's code or data segment and so can be used only within parts of a program small enough to fit in one segment. Far pointers are 32-bit segment:offset pairs resolving to 20-bit external addresses. Some compilers also support ''huge'' pointers, which are like far pointers except that [[pointer arithmetic]] on a huge pointer treats it as a linear 20-bit pointer, while pointer arithmetic on a far pointer [[integer overflow|wraps around]] within its 16-bit offset without touching the segment part of the address.\n\nTo avoid the need to specify ''near'' and ''far'' on numerous pointers, data structures, and functions, compilers also support \"memory models\" which specify default pointer sizes. The ''tiny'' (max 64K), ''small'' (max 128K), ''compact'' (data > 64K), ''medium'' (code > 64K), ''large'' (code,data > 64K), and ''huge'' (individual arrays > 64K) models cover practical combinations of near, far, and huge pointers for code and data. The ''tiny'' model means that code and data are shared in a single segment, just as in most 8-bit based processors, and can be used to build ''[[COM file|.com]]'' files for instance. Precompiled libraries often come in several versions compiled for different memory models.\n\nAccording to Morse et al.,.<ref name=\"File\">[http://stevemorse.org/8086history/8086history.doc Intel Microprocessors : 8008 to 8086 by Stephen P. Morse et al.]</ref> the designers actually contemplated using an 8-bit shift (instead of 4-bit), in order to create a 16&nbsp;MB physical address space. However, as this would have forced segments to begin on 256-byte boundaries, and 1&nbsp;MB was considered very large for a microprocessor around 1976, the idea was dismissed. Also, there were not enough pins available on a low cost 40-pin package for the additional four address bus pins.\n\nIn principle, the address space of the x86 series ''could'' have been extended in later processors by increasing the shift value, as long as applications obtained their segments from the operating system and did not make assumptions about the equivalence of different segment:offset pairs.<ref group=\"note\" >Some 80186 clones did change the shift value, but were never commonly used in desktop computers.</ref> In practice the use of \"huge\" pointers and similar mechanisms was widespread and the flat 32-bit addressing made possible with the 32-bit offset registers in the 80386 eventually extended the limited addressing range in a more general way (see below).\n\nIntel could have decided to implement memory in 16 bit words (which would have eliminated the {{overline|BHE}} signal along with much of the address bus complexities already described).  This would mean that all instruction object codes and data would have to be accessed in 16-bit units.  Users of the [[8080]] long ago realized, in hindsight, that the processor makes very efficient use of its memory.  By having a large number of 8-bit object codes, the 8080 produces object code as compact as some of the most powerful minicomputers on the market at the time.<ref name=\"Osborne\">Osborne 16 bit Processor Handbook (Adam Osborne & Gerry Kane) {{ISBN|0-931988-43-8}}</ref>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\nIf the 8086 is to retain 8-bit object codes and hence the efficient memory use of the 8080, then it cannot guarantee that (16-bit) opcodes and data will lie on an even-odd byte address boundary.  The first 8-bit opcode will shift the next 8-bit instruction to an odd byte or a 16-bit instruction to an odd-even byte boundary.  By implementing the {{overline|BHE}} signal and the extra logic needed, the 8086 allows instructions to exist as 1-byte, 3-byte or any other odd byte object codes.<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\nSimply put: this is a trade off.  If memory addressing is simplified so that memory is only accessed in 16-bit units, memory will be used less efficiently.  Intel decided to make the logic more complicated, but memory use more efficient.  This was at a time when memory size was considerably smaller, and at a premium, than that which users are used to today.<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\n====Porting older software====\nSmall programs could ignore the segmentation and just use plain 16-bit addressing. This allows [[8-bit]] software to be quite easily ported to the 8086. The authors of most [[DOS]] implementations took advantage of this by providing an [[Application Programming Interface]] very similar to [[CP/M]] as well as including the simple ''.com'' executable file format, identical to CP/M. This was important when the 8086 and MS-DOS were new, because it allowed many existing CP/M (and other) applications to be quickly made available, greatly easing acceptance of the new platform.\n\n===Example code===\nThe following 8086/8088 [[assembly language|assembler]] source code is for a subroutine named <code>_memcpy</code> that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations.\n\n<!--NOTE: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU-->\n<!--NOTE: The hex codes were assembled by hand, so there may be errors-->\n{|\n|\n<!--NOTE: DO NOT REMOVE BLANK LINES--><pre>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0000:1000\n \n0000:1000\n0000:1000 55\n0000:1001 89 E5\n0000:1003 06\n0000:1004 8B 4E 06\n0000:1007 E3 11\n0000:1009 8B 76 04\n0000:100C 8B 7E 02\n0000:100F 1E\n0000:1010 07\n \n0000:1011 8A 04\n0000:1013 88 05\n0000:1015 46\n0000:1016 47\n0000:1017 49\n0000:1018 75 F7\n \n0000:101A 07\n0000:101B 5D\n0000:101C 29 C0\n0000:101E C3\n0000:101F\n</pre>\n|\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; _memcpy(dst, src, len)\n; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n;\n; Entry stack parameters\n;      [BP+6] = len, Number of bytes to copy\n;      [BP+4] = src, Address of source data block\n;      [BP+2] = dst, Address of target data block\n;\n; Return registers\n;      AX = Zero\n\n            org     1000h       ; Start at 0000:1000h\n\n_memcpy     proc\n            push    bp          ; Set up the call frame\n            mov     bp,sp\n            push    es          ; Save ES\n            mov     cx,[bp+6]   ; Set CX = len\n            jcxz    done        ; If len = 0, return\n            mov     si,[bp+4]   ; Set SI = src\n            mov     di,[bp+2]   ; Set DI = dst\n            push    ds          ; Set ES = DS\n            pop     es\n\nloop        mov     al,[si]     ; Load AL from [src]\n            mov     [di],al     ; Store AL to [dst]\n            inc     si          ; Increment src\n            inc     di          ; Increment dst\n            dec     cx          ; Decrement len\n            jnz     loop        ; Repeat the loop\n\ndone        pop     es          ; Restore ES\n            pop     bp          ; Restore previous call frame\n            sub     ax,ax       ; Set AX = 0\n            ret                 ; Return\n            end proc\n</source>\n|}\n\nThe code above uses the BP (base pointer) register to establish a [[call frame]], an area on the stack that contains all of the parameters and local variables for the execution of the subroutine. This kind of [[calling convention]] supports [[reentrancy (computing)|reentrant]] and [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] code, and has been used by most ALGOL-like languages since the late 1950s.\n\nThe above routine is a rather cumbersome way to copy blocks of data. The 8086 provides dedicated instructions for copying strings of bytes. These instructions assume that the source data is stored at DS:SI, the destination data is stored at ES:DI, and that the number of elements to copy is stored in CX. The above routine requires the source and the destination block to be in the same segment, therefore DS is copied to ES. The loop section of the above can be replaced by:\n{|\n|\n<pre>\n0000:1011 FC\n0000:1012 F2\n0000:1013 A4\n</pre>\n|\n<source lang=nasm>\n            cld                  ; Copy towards higher addresses\nloop        repnz                ; Repeat until CX = 0\n            movsb                ; Move the data block\n</source>\n|}\nThis copies the block of data one byte at a time.  The <code>REPNZ</code> instruction causes the following <code>MOVSB</code> to repeat until CX is zero, automatically incrementing SI and DI and decrementing CX as it repeats.  Alternatively the <code>MOVSW</code> instruction can be used to copy 16-bit words (double bytes) at a time (in which case CX counts the number of words copied instead of the number of bytes).  Most assemblers will properly recognize the <code>REPNZ</code> instruction if used as an in-line prefix to the <code>MOVSB</code> instruction, as in <code>REPNZ MOVSB</code>.\n\nThis routine will operate correctly if interrupted, because the program counter will continue to point to the <code>REP</code> instruction until the block copy is completed.  The copy will therefore continue from where it left off when the interrupt service routine returns control.\n\n===Performance===\n[[File:Intel 8086 block scheme.svg|thumb|405px|''Simplified block diagram over Intel 8088 (a variant of 8086); 1=main registers; 2=segment registers and IP; 3=address adder; 4=internal address bus; 5=instruction queue; 6=control unit (very simplified!); 7=bus interface; 8=internal databus; 9=ALU; 10/11/12=external address/data/control bus.'']]\n\nAlthough partly shadowed by other design choices in this particular chip, the [[multiplexed]] address and [[Bus (computing)|data buses]] limit performance slightly; transfers of 16-bit or 8-bit quantities are done in a four-clock memory access cycle, which is faster on 16-bit, although slower on 8-bit quantities, compared to many contemporary 8-bit based CPUs. As instructions vary from one to six bytes, fetch and execution are made [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] and decoupled into separate units (as it remains in today's x86 processors): The ''bus interface unit'' feeds the instruction stream to the ''execution unit'' through a 6-byte prefetch queue (a form of loosely coupled [[pipelining]]), speeding up operations on [[Processor register|register]]s and [[Operand|immediate]]s, while memory operations became slower (four years later, this performance problem was fixed with the [[80186]] and [[80286]]). However, the full (instead of partial) 16-bit architecture with a full width [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] meant that 16-bit arithmetic instructions could now be performed with a single ALU cycle (instead of two, via internal carry, as in the 8080 and 8085), speeding up such instructions considerably. Combined with [[orthogonalization]]s of operations versus [[operand]] types and [[addressing mode]]s, as well as other enhancements, this made the performance gain over the 8080 or 8085 fairly significant, despite cases where the older chips may be faster (see below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100px; height: 50px;\"\n|+ Execution times for typical instructions (in clock cycles)<ref>{{cite book|title=Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.0 Reference Manual|year=1987|publisher=Microsoft Corporation| quote=Timings and encodings in this manual are used with permission of Intel and come from the following publications: Intel Corporation. iAPX 86, 88, 186 and 188 User's Manual, Programmer's Reference, Santa Clara, Calif. 1986.|title-link=MASM}} (Similarly for iAPX 286, 80386, 80387.)</ref>\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:bottom; border-bottom:3px double #999;\"\n!align=left | instruction\n!align=left | register-register\n!align=left | register immediate\n!align=left | register-memory\n!align=left | memory-register\n!align=left | memory-immediate\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|mov || 2 || 4|| 8+EA || 9+EA || 10+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|ALU || 3 ||4|| 9+EA, || 16+EA,|| 17+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|jump || colspan=\"5\" | ''register'' \u2265 11 ; ''label'' \u2265 15 ; ''condition,label'' \u2265 16\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer multiply || colspan=\"5\" | 70~160 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer divide || colspan=\"5\" | 80~190 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|}\n* EA = time to compute effective address, ranging from 5 to 12 cycles.\n* Timings are best case, depending on prefetch status, instruction alignment, and other factors.\n\nAs can be seen from these tables, operations on registers and immediates were fast (between 2 and 4 cycles), while memory-operand instructions and jumps were quite slow; jumps took more cycles than on the simple [[Intel 8080|8080]] and [[Intel 8085|8085]], and the 8088 (used in the IBM PC) was additionally hampered by its narrower bus. The reasons why most memory related instructions were slow were threefold:\n* Loosely coupled fetch and execution units are efficient for instruction prefetch, but not for jumps and random data access (without special measures).\n* No dedicated address calculation adder was afforded; the microcode routines had to use the main ALU for this (although there was a dedicated ''segment'' + ''offset'' adder).\n* The address and data buses were [[multiplexing|multiplex]]ed, forcing a slightly longer (33~50%) bus cycle than in typical contemporary 8-bit processors.\n\nHowever, memory access performance was drastically enhanced with Intel's next generation of 8086 family CPUs. The [[Intel 80186|80186]] and [[Intel 80286|80286]] both had dedicated address calculation hardware, saving many cycles, and the 80286 also had separate (non-multiplexed) address and data buses.\n\n===Floating point===\nThe 8086/8088 could be connected to a mathematical coprocessor to add hardware/microcode-based [[floating-point]] performance. The [[Intel 8087]] was the standard math coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088, operating on 80-bit numbers. Manufacturers like [[Cyrix]] (8087-compatible) and [[Weitek]] (''not'' 8087-compatible) eventually came up with high-performance floating-point coprocessors that competed with the 8087.\n\n==Chip versions==\nThe clock frequency was originally limited to 5&nbsp;MHz,<ref group=\"note\" >(IBM PC used 4.77&nbsp;MHz, 4/3 the standard NTSC [[color burst]] frequency)</ref> but the last versions in [[HMOS]] were specified for 10&nbsp;MHz. HMOS-III and [[CMOS]] versions were manufactured for a long time (at least a while into the 1990s) for [[embedded system]]s, although its successor, the [[Intel 80186|80186]]/[[Intel 80188|80188]] (which includes some on-chip peripherals), has been more popular for embedded use.\n\nThe 80C86, the CMOS version of the 8086, was used in the [[GRiDPad]], [[Toshiba T1200]], [[HP 110]], and finally the 1998\u20131999 [[Lunar Prospector]].\n\nFor the packaging, the Intel 8086 was available both in ceramic and plastic DIP packages.\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n| [[Image:Intel_D8086_CS.jpg|thumb|A ceramic D8086 variant]]\n| [[Image:Intel_P8086.jpg|thumb|A plastic P8086 variant]]\n|}\n\n===List of Intel 8086===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, the [[NEC V20]] and [[NEC V30]] pair were hardware-compatible with the 8088 and 8086 even though NEC made original Intel clones \u03bcPD8088D and \u03bcPD8086D respectively, but incorporated the instruction set of the 80186 along with some (but not all) of the 80186 speed enhancements, providing a drop-in capability to upgrade both instruction set and processing speed without manufacturers having to modify their designs. Such relatively simple and low-power 8086-compatible processors in CMOS are still used in embedded systems.\n\nThe electronics industry of the [[Soviet Union]] was able to replicate the 8086 through {{citation needed-span|both [[industrial espionage]] and reverse engineering|date=October 2013}}. The resulting chip, [[K1810VM86]], was binary and pin-compatible with the 8086.\n\ni8086 and i8088 were respectively the cores of the Soviet-made PC-compatible [[EC1831]] and [[EC1832]] desktops.

However, the EC1831 computer (IZOT 1036C) had significant hardware differences from the IBM PC prototype. The EC1831 was the first PC-compatible computer with dynamic bus sizing (US Pat.

In addition, it makes PCB layout simpler and boards cheaper, as well as demanding fewer (1- or 4-bit wide) DRAM chips.</ref> and is notable as the processor used in the original [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] design.\n\nThe 8086 gave rise to the [[x86 architecture]], which eventually became Intel's most successful line of processors. On June 5, 2018, Intel released a limited-edition CPU celebrating the anniversary of the  Intel 8086, called the Intel Core i7-8086K.<ref name=\"Intel\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1972, Intel launched the [[Intel 8008|8008]], the first 8-bit microprocessor.<ref group=\"note\" >using enhancement load [[PMOS logic]] (requiring 14&nbsp;[[Volt|V]], achieving TTL compatibility by having V<sub>CC</sub> at +5&nbsp;V and V<sub>DD</sub> at \u22129&nbsp;V).</ref> It implemented an [[instruction set]] designed by [[Datapoint]] corporation with programmable [[Computer terminal|CRT terminals]] in mind, which also proved to be fairly general-purpose. The device needed several additional [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s to produce a functional computer, in part due to it being packaged in a small 18-pin \"memory package\", which ruled out the use of a separate address bus (Intel was primarily a [[DRAM]] manufacturer at the time).\n\nTwo years later, Intel launched the [[Intel 8080|8080]],<ref group=\"note\">Using non-saturated enhancement-load [[NMOS logic]] (demanding a higher gate voltage for the load-transistor gates).</ref> employing the new 40-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIL package]]s originally developed for [[calculator]] ICs to enable a separate address bus. It has an extended instruction set that is [[source-compatible]] (not [[binary compatible]]) with the 8008<ref>{{Cite web\n  |website=CPU World\n  |title=8080 family\n  |url=http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8080/\n}}</ref> and also includes some [[16-bit]] instructions to make programming easier. The 8080 device, was eventually replaced by the [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-load]]-based [[Intel 8085|8085]] (1977), which sufficed with a single +5&nbsp;V power supply instead of the three different operating voltages of earlier chips.<ref group=\"note\">Made possible with depletion-load nMOS logic (the 8085 was later made using HMOS processing, just like the 8086).</ref> Other well known 8-bit microprocessors that emerged during these years are [[Motorola 6800]] (1974), [[PIC microcontroller|General Instrument PIC16X]] (1975), [[MOS Technology 6502]] (1975), [[Zilog Z80]] (1976), and [[Motorola 6809]] (1978).\n\n===The first x86 design===\n[[File:Intel 8086 CPU Die.JPG|thumb|Intel 8086 CPU die image]]\nThe 8086 project started in May 1976 and was originally intended as a temporary substitute for the ambitious and delayed [[iAPX 432]] project. It was an attempt to draw attention from the less-delayed 16- and 32-bit processors of other manufacturers (such as [[Motorola]], [[Zilog]], and [[National Semiconductor]]) and at the same time to counter the threat from the [[Zilog Z80]] (designed by former Intel employees), which became very successful. Both the architecture and the physical chip were therefore developed rather quickly by a small group of people, and using the same basic [[microarchitecture]] elements and physical implementation techniques as employed for the slightly older [[Intel 8085|8085]] (and for which the 8086 also would function as a continuation).\n\nMarketed as [[Source code compatibility|source compatible]],<ref name=\"Scanlon_1988\"/> the 8086 was designed to allow [[assembly language]] for the 8008{{fact|date=January 2020|reason=Any example for this?}}, 8080, or 8085 to be [[Assembly language translator|automatically converted]] into equivalent (suboptimal) 8086 source code, with little or no hand-editing. The programming model and instruction set is (loosely) based on the 8080 in order to make this possible. However, the 8086 design was expanded to support full 16-bit processing, instead of the fairly limited 16-bit capabilities of the 8080 and 8085.\n\nNew kinds of instructions were added as well; full support for signed integers, base+offset addressing, and self-repeating operations were akin to the [[Z80]] design<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/146957/birth_of_a_standard_the_intel_8086_microprocessor.html Birth of a Standard: The Intel 8086 Microprocessor. Thirty years ago, Intel released the 8086 processor, introducing the x86 architecture that underlies every PC \u2014 Windows, Mac, or Linux \u2014 produced today], PC World, June 17, 2008</ref> but were all made slightly more general in the 8086. Instructions directly supporting [[nested function|nested]] [[ALGOL]]-family languages such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[PL/M]] were also added. According to principal architect [[Stephen P. Morse]], this was a result of a more software-centric approach than in the design of earlier Intel processors (the designers had experience working with compiler implementations). Other enhancements included [[microcode]]d multiply and divide instructions and a bus structure better adapted to future coprocessors (such as [[Intel 8087|8087]] and [[Intel 8089|8089]]) and multiprocessor systems.\n\nThe first revision of the instruction set and high level architecture was ready after about three months,<ref group=\"note\" >Rev.0 of the instruction set and architecture was ready in about three months, according to Morse.</ref> and as almost no CAD tools were used, four engineers and 12&nbsp;layout people were simultaneously working on the chip.<ref group=\"note\" >Using [[rubylith]], light boards, rulers, electric erasers, and a [[digitizer]] (according to Jenny Hernandez, member of the 8086 design team, in a statement made on Intel's webpage for its 25th birthday).</ref> The 8086 took a little more than two years from idea to working product, which was considered rather fast for a complex design in 1976\u20131978.\n\nThe 8086 was sequenced<ref group=\"note\" >8086 used less microcode than many competitors' designs, such as the MC68000 and others</ref> using a mixture of [[random logic]]<ref>Randall L. Geiger, Phillip E. Allen, Noel R. Strader ''VLSI design techniques for analog and digital circuits'', McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1990, {{ISBN|0-07-023253-9}}, page 779 \"Random Logic vs. Structured Logic Forms\", illustration of use of \"random\" describing CPU control logic</ref> and [[microcode]] and was implemented using depletion-load nMOS circuitry with approximately 20,000&nbsp;active [[transistor]]s (29,000 counting all [[Read only memory|ROM]] and [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] sites). It was soon moved to a new refined nMOS manufacturing process called [[HMOS]] (for High performance MOS) that Intel originally developed for manufacturing of fast [[static RAM]] products.<ref group=\"note\" >Fast static RAMs in MOS technology (as fast as bipolar RAMs) was an important product for Intel during this period.</ref> This was followed by HMOS-II, HMOS-III versions, and, eventually, a fully static [[CMOS]] version for battery powered devices, manufactured using Intel's [[CHMOS]] processes.<ref group=\"note\" >CHMOS is Intel's name for CMOS circuits manufactured using processing steps very similar to [[HMOS]].</ref> The original chip measured 33&nbsp;mm\u00b2 and minimum feature size was 3.2&nbsp;\u03bcm.\n\nThe architecture was defined by [[Stephen P. Morse]] with some help and assistance by Bruce Ravenel (the architect of the 8087) in refining the final revisions. Logic designer Jim McKevitt and John Bayliss were the lead engineers of the hardware-level development team<ref group=\"note\" >Other members of the design team were Peter A.Stoll and Jenny Hernandez.</ref> and Bill Pohlman the manager for the project. The legacy of the 8086 is enduring in the basic instruction set of today's personal computers and servers; the 8086 also lent its last two digits to later extended versions of the design, such as the [[Intel 286]] and the [[Intel 386]], all of which eventually became known as the [[x86]] family. (Another reference is that the [[PCI Configuration Space|PCI Vendor ID]] for Intel devices is 8086<sub>h</sub>.)\n\n==Details==\n[[File:Intel 8086 pinout.svg|thumb|300px|The 8086 pin assignments in min and max mode]]\n\n===Buses and operation===\nAll internal registers, as well as internal and external data buses, are 16&nbsp;bits wide, which firmly established the \"16-bit microprocessor\" identity of the 8086. A 20-bit external address bus provides a 1&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] physical address space (2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576). This address space is addressed by means of internal memory \"segmentation\". The data bus is [[multiplexed]] with the address bus in order to fit all of the control lines into a standard 40-pin [[dual in-line package]]. It provides a 16-bit I/O address bus, supporting 64&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of separate I/O space. The maximum linear address space is limited to 64&nbsp;KB, simply because internal address/index registers are only 16&nbsp;bits wide. Programming over 64&nbsp;KB memory boundaries involves adjusting the segment registers (see below); this difficulty existed until the [[80386]] architecture introduced wider (32-bit) registers (the memory management hardware in the [[80286]] did not help in this regard, as its registers are still only 16 bits wide).\n\n===Hardware modes===\nSome of the control pins, which carry essential signals for all external operations, have more than one function depending upon whether the device is operated in ''min'' or ''max'' mode. The former mode is intended for small single-processor systems, while the latter is for medium or large systems using more than one processor (a kind of multiprocessor mode). Maximum mode is required when using an 8087 or 8089 coprocessor. The voltage on pin 33 (MN/{{overline|MX}}) determine the mode. Changing the state of pin 33 changes the function of certain other pins, most of which have to do with how the CPU handles the (local) bus. <ref group=\"note\" >The IBM PC and PC/XT use an Intel 8088 running in maximum mode, which allows the CPU to work with an optional 8087 coprocessor installed in the math coprocessor socket on the PC or PC/XT mainboard. (The PC and PC/XT may require maximum mode for other reasons, such as perhaps to support the DMA controller.)</ref> The mode is usually hardwired into the circuit and therefore cannot be changed by software. The workings of these modes are described in terms of timing diagrams in Intel datasheets and manuals. In minimum mode, all control signals are generated by the 8086 itself.\n\n===Registers and instructions===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:75%;\"\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |''Intel 8086 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

color:black\" | Flags\n|}\n|}\nThe 8086 has eight more or less general 16-bit [[processor register|registers]] (including the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack pointer]] but excluding the instruction pointer, flag register and segment registers). Four of them, AX, BX, CX, DX, can also be accessed as twice as many 8-bit registers (see figure) while the other four, SI, DI, BP, SP, are 16-bit only.\n\nDue to a compact encoding inspired by 8-bit processors, most instructions are one-address or two-address operations, which means that the result is stored in one of the operands. At most one of the operands can be in memory, but this memory operand can also be the ''destination'', while the other operand, the ''source'', can be either ''register'' or ''immediate''. A single memory location can also often be used as both ''source'' and ''destination'' which, among other factors, further contributes to a [[code density]] comparable to (and often better than) most eight-bit machines at the time.\n\nThe degree of generality of most registers are much greater than in the 8080 or 8085. However, 8086 registers were more specialized than in most contemporary [[minicomputer]]s and are also used implicitly by some instructions. While perfectly sensible for the assembly programmer, this makes register allocation for compilers more complicated compared to more orthogonal 16-bit and 32-bit processors of the time such as the [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[68000]], [[32016]] etc. On the other hand, being more regular than the rather minimalistic but ubiquitous 8-bit microprocessors such as the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], [[Motorola 6800|6800]], [[6809]], [[Intel 8085|8085]], [[MCS-48]], [[Intel 8051|8051]], and other contemporary accumulator-based machines, it is significantly easier to construct an efficient [[code generator]] for the 8086 architecture.\n\nAnother factor for this is that the 8086 also introduced some new instructions (not present in the 8080 and 8085) to better support stack-based high-level programming languages such as Pascal and [[PL/M]]; some of the more useful instructions are '''push''' ''mem-op'', and '''ret''' ''size'', supporting the \"Pascal [[calling convention]]\" directly. (Several others, such as '''push'''&nbsp;''immed'' and '''enter''', were added in the subsequent 80186, 80286, and 80386 processors.)\n\nA 64&nbsp;KB (one segment) [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] growing towards lower addresses is supported in [[computer hardware|hardware]]; 16-bit words are pushed onto the stack, and the top of the stack is pointed to by SS:SP. There are 256&nbsp;[[interrupt]]s, which can be invoked by both hardware and software. The interrupts can cascade, using the stack to store the [[return address (computing)|return address]]es.\n\nThe 8086 has 64&nbsp;K of 8-bit (or alternatively 32&nbsp;K of 16-bit word) [[I/O port]] space.\n\n===Flags===\nThe 8086 has a 16-bit [[status register|flags register]]. Nine of these condition code flags are active, and indicate the current state of the processor: [[Carry flag]] (CF), [[Parity flag]] (PF), [[Auxiliary flag|Auxiliary carry flag]] (AF), [[Zero flag]] (ZF), [[Sign flag]] (SF), [[Trap flag]] (TF), [[IF (x86 flag)|Interrupt flag]] (IF), [[Direction flag]] (DF), and [[Overflow flag]] (OF).\nAlso referred to as the status word, the layout of the flags register is as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|title=IAPX 86, 88, 186, and 188 user's manual : programmer's reference|others=Intel Corporation.|isbn=978-0835930352|location=Santa Clara, CA|oclc=11091251}}</ref>{{Rp|3\u20135}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Rather than concatenating the segment register with the address register, as in most processors whose address space exceeds their register size, the 8086 shifts the 16-bit segment only four bits left before adding it to the 16-bit offset (16\u00d7segment + offset), therefore producing a 20-bit external (or effective or physical) address from the 32-bit segment:offset pair. As a result, each external address can be referred to by 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 different segment:offset pairs.\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:5em\"\n|-\n| <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#DED\">0110 1000 1000 0111</tt><tt>&nbsp;0000</tt>\n| '''Segment''',\n| 16 bits, shifted 4 bits left (or multiplied by 0x10)\n|-\n| <tt>+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#DDF\">0011 0100 1010 1001</tt>\n| '''Offset''',\n| 16 bits\n|- style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"\n| <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>\n|\n|-\n| <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#FDF\">0110 1011 1101 0001 1001</tt>\n| '''Address''',\n| 20 bits\n|}\n\nAlthough considered complicated and cumbersome by many programmers, this scheme also has advantages; a small program (less than 64&nbsp;KB) can be loaded starting at a fixed offset (such as 0000) in its own segment, avoiding the need for [[Relocation (computing)|relocation]], with at most 15&nbsp;bytes of alignment waste.\n\nCompilers for the 8086 family commonly support two types of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]], ''near'' and ''far''. Near pointers are 16-bit offsets implicitly associated with the program's code or data segment and so can be used only within parts of a program small enough to fit in one segment. Far pointers are 32-bit segment:offset pairs resolving to 20-bit external addresses. Some compilers also support ''huge'' pointers, which are like far pointers except that [[pointer arithmetic]] on a huge pointer treats it as a linear 20-bit pointer, while pointer arithmetic on a far pointer [[integer overflow|wraps around]] within its 16-bit offset without touching the segment part of the address.\n\nTo avoid the need to specify ''near'' and ''far'' on numerous pointers, data structures, and functions, compilers also support \"memory models\" which specify default pointer sizes. The ''tiny'' (max 64K), ''small'' (max 128K), ''compact'' (data > 64K), ''medium'' (code > 64K), ''large'' (code,data > 64K), and ''huge'' (individual arrays > 64K) models cover practical combinations of near, far, and huge pointers for code and data. The ''tiny'' model means that code and data are shared in a single segment, just as in most 8-bit based processors, and can be used to build ''[[COM file|.com]]'' files for instance. Precompiled libraries often come in several versions compiled for different memory models.\n\nAccording to Morse et al.,.<ref name=\"File\">[http://stevemorse.org/8086history/8086history.doc Intel Microprocessors : 8008 to 8086 by Stephen P. Morse et al.]</ref> the designers actually contemplated using an 8-bit shift (instead of 4-bit), in order to create a 16&nbsp;MB physical address space. However, as this would have forced segments to begin on 256-byte boundaries, and 1&nbsp;MB was considered very large for a microprocessor around 1976, the idea was dismissed. Also, there were not enough pins available on a low cost 40-pin package for the additional four address bus pins.\n\nIn principle, the address space of the x86 series ''could'' have been extended in later processors by increasing the shift value, as long as applications obtained their segments from the operating system and did not make assumptions about the equivalence of different segment:offset pairs.<ref group=\"note\" >Some 80186 clones did change the shift value, but were never commonly used in desktop computers.</ref> In practice the use of \"huge\" pointers and similar mechanisms was widespread and the flat 32-bit addressing made possible with the 32-bit offset registers in the 80386 eventually extended the limited addressing range in a more general way (see below).\n\nIntel could have decided to implement memory in 16 bit words (which would have eliminated the {{overline|BHE}} signal along with much of the address bus complexities already described).  This would mean that all instruction object codes and data would have to be accessed in 16-bit units.  Users of the [[8080]] long ago realized, in hindsight, that the processor makes very efficient use of its memory.  By having a large number of 8-bit object codes, the 8080 produces object code as compact as some of the most powerful minicomputers on the market at the time.<ref name=\"Osborne\">Osborne 16 bit Processor Handbook (Adam Osborne & Gerry Kane) {{ISBN|0-931988-43-8}}</ref>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\nIf the 8086 is to retain 8-bit object codes and hence the efficient memory use of the 8080, then it cannot guarantee that (16-bit) opcodes and data will lie on an even-odd byte address boundary.  The first 8-bit opcode will shift the next 8-bit instruction to an odd byte or a 16-bit instruction to an odd-even byte boundary.  By implementing the {{overline|BHE}} signal and the extra logic needed, the 8086 allows instructions to exist as 1-byte, 3-byte or any other odd byte object codes.<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\nSimply put: this is a trade off.  If memory addressing is simplified so that memory is only accessed in 16-bit units, memory will be used less efficiently.  Intel decided to make the logic more complicated, but memory use more efficient.  This was at a time when memory size was considerably smaller, and at a premium, than that which users are used to today.<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\n====Porting older software====\nSmall programs could ignore the segmentation and just use plain 16-bit addressing. This allows [[8-bit]] software to be quite easily ported to the 8086. The authors of most [[DOS]] implementations took advantage of this by providing an [[Application Programming Interface]] very similar to [[CP/M]] as well as including the simple ''.com'' executable file format, identical to CP/M. This was important when the 8086 and MS-DOS were new, because it allowed many existing CP/M (and other) applications to be quickly made available, greatly easing acceptance of the new platform.\n\n===Example code===\nThe following 8086/8088 [[assembly language|assembler]] source code is for a subroutine named <code>_memcpy</code> that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations.\n\n<!--NOTE: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU-->\n<!--NOTE: The hex codes were assembled by hand, so there may be errors-->\n{|\n|\n<!--NOTE: DO NOT REMOVE BLANK LINES--><pre>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0000:1000\n \n0000:1000\n0000:1000 55\n0000:1001 89 E5\n0000:1003 06\n0000:1004 8B 4E 06\n0000:1007 E3 11\n0000:1009 8B 76 04\n0000:100C 8B 7E 02\n0000:100F 1E\n0000:1010 07\n \n0000:1011 8A 04\n0000:1013 88 05\n0000:1015 46\n0000:1016 47\n0000:1017 49\n0000:1018 75 F7\n \n0000:101A 07\n0000:101B 5D\n0000:101C 29 C0\n0000:101E C3\n0000:101F\n</pre>\n|\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; _memcpy(dst, src, len)\n; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n;\n; Entry stack parameters\n;      [BP+6] = len, Number of bytes to copy\n;      [BP+4] = src, Address of source data block\n;      [BP+2] = dst, Address of target data block\n;\n; Return registers\n;      AX = Zero\n\n            org     1000h       ; Start at 0000:1000h\n\n_memcpy     proc\n            push    bp          ; Set up the call frame\n            mov     bp,sp\n            push    es          ; Save ES\n            mov     cx,[bp+6]   ; Set CX = len\n            jcxz    done        ; If len = 0, return\n            mov     si,[bp+4]   ; Set SI = src\n            mov     di,[bp+2]   ; Set DI = dst\n            push    ds          ; Set ES = DS\n            pop     es\n\nloop        mov     al,[si]     ; Load AL from [src]\n            mov     [di],al     ; Store AL to [dst]\n            inc     si          ; Increment src\n            inc     di          ; Increment dst\n            dec     cx          ; Decrement len\n            jnz     loop        ; Repeat the loop\n\ndone        pop     es          ; Restore ES\n            pop     bp          ; Restore previous call frame\n            sub     ax,ax       ; Set AX = 0\n            ret                 ; Return\n            end proc\n</source>\n|}\n\nThe code above uses the BP (base pointer) register to establish a [[call frame]], an area on the stack that contains all of the parameters and local variables for the execution of the subroutine. This kind of [[calling convention]] supports [[reentrancy (computing)|reentrant]] and [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] code, and has been used by most ALGOL-like languages since the late 1950s.\n\nThe above routine is a rather cumbersome way to copy blocks of data. The 8086 provides dedicated instructions for copying strings of bytes. These instructions assume that the source data is stored at DS:SI, the destination data is stored at ES:DI, and that the number of elements to copy is stored in CX. The above routine requires the source and the destination block to be in the same segment, therefore DS is copied to ES. The loop section of the above can be replaced by:\n{|\n|\n<pre>\n0000:1011 FC\n0000:1012 F2\n0000:1013 A4\n</pre>\n|\n<source lang=nasm>\n            cld                  ; Copy towards higher addresses\nloop        repnz                ; Repeat until CX = 0\n            movsb                ; Move the data block\n</source>\n|}\nThis copies the block of data one byte at a time.  The <code>REPNZ</code> instruction causes the following <code>MOVSB</code> to repeat until CX is zero, automatically incrementing SI and DI and decrementing CX as it repeats.  Alternatively the <code>MOVSW</code> instruction can be used to copy 16-bit words (double bytes) at a time (in which case CX counts the number of words copied instead of the number of bytes).  Most assemblers will properly recognize the <code>REPNZ</code> instruction if used as an in-line prefix to the <code>MOVSB</code> instruction, as in <code>REPNZ MOVSB</code>.\n\nThis routine will operate correctly if interrupted, because the program counter will continue to point to the <code>REP</code> instruction until the block copy is completed.  The copy will therefore continue from where it left off when the interrupt service routine returns control.\n\n===Performance===\n[[File:Intel 8086 block scheme.svg|thumb|405px|''Simplified block diagram over Intel 8088 (a variant of 8086); 1=main registers; 2=segment registers and IP; 3=address adder; 4=internal address bus; 5=instruction queue; 6=control unit (very simplified!); 7=bus interface; 8=internal databus; 9=ALU; 10/11/12=external address/data/control bus.'']]\n\nAlthough partly shadowed by other design choices in this particular chip, the [[multiplexed]] address and [[Bus (computing)|data buses]] limit performance slightly; transfers of 16-bit or 8-bit quantities are done in a four-clock memory access cycle, which is faster on 16-bit, although slower on 8-bit quantities, compared to many contemporary 8-bit based CPUs. As instructions vary from one to six bytes, fetch and execution are made [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] and decoupled into separate units (as it remains in today's x86 processors): The ''bus interface unit'' feeds the instruction stream to the ''execution unit'' through a 6-byte prefetch queue (a form of loosely coupled [[pipelining]]), speeding up operations on [[Processor register|register]]s and [[Operand|immediate]]s, while memory operations became slower (four years later, this performance problem was fixed with the [[80186]] and [[80286]]). However, the full (instead of partial) 16-bit architecture with a full width [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] meant that 16-bit arithmetic instructions could now be performed with a single ALU cycle (instead of two, via internal carry, as in the 8080 and 8085), speeding up such instructions considerably. Combined with [[orthogonalization]]s of operations versus [[operand]] types and [[addressing mode]]s, as well as other enhancements, this made the performance gain over the 8080 or 8085 fairly significant, despite cases where the older chips may be faster (see below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100px; height: 50px;\"\n|+ Execution times for typical instructions (in clock cycles)<ref>{{cite book|title=Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.0 Reference Manual|year=1987|publisher=Microsoft Corporation| quote=Timings and encodings in this manual are used with permission of Intel and come from the following publications: Intel Corporation. iAPX 86, 88, 186 and 188 User's Manual, Programmer's Reference, Santa Clara, Calif. 1986.|title-link=MASM}} (Similarly for iAPX 286, 80386, 80387.)</ref>\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:bottom; border-bottom:3px double #999;\"\n!align=left | instruction\n!align=left | register-register\n!align=left | register immediate\n!align=left | register-memory\n!align=left | memory-register\n!align=left | memory-immediate\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|mov || 2 || 4|| 8+EA || 9+EA || 10+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|ALU || 3 ||4|| 9+EA, || 16+EA,|| 17+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|jump || colspan=\"5\" | ''register'' \u2265 11 ; ''label'' \u2265 15 ; ''condition,label'' \u2265 16\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer multiply || colspan=\"5\" | 70~160 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer divide || colspan=\"5\" | 80~190 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|}\n* EA = time to compute effective address, ranging from 5 to 12 cycles.\n* Timings are best case, depending on prefetch status, instruction alignment, and other factors.\n\nAs can be seen from these tables, operations on registers and immediates were fast (between 2 and 4 cycles), while memory-operand instructions and jumps were quite slow; jumps took more cycles than on the simple [[Intel 8080|8080]] and [[Intel 8085|8085]], and the 8088 (used in the IBM PC) was additionally hampered by its narrower bus. The reasons why most memory related instructions were slow were threefold:\n* Loosely coupled fetch and execution units are efficient for instruction prefetch, but not for jumps and random data access (without special measures).\n* No dedicated address calculation adder was afforded; the microcode routines had to use the main ALU for this (although there was a dedicated ''segment'' + ''offset'' adder).\n* The address and data buses were [[multiplexing|multiplex]]ed, forcing a slightly longer (33~50%) bus cycle than in typical contemporary 8-bit processors.\n\nHowever, memory access performance was drastically enhanced with Intel's next generation of 8086 family CPUs. The [[Intel 80186|80186]] and [[Intel 80286|80286]] both had dedicated address calculation hardware, saving many cycles, and the 80286 also had separate (non-multiplexed) address and data buses.\n\n===Floating point===\nThe 8086/8088 could be connected to a mathematical coprocessor to add hardware/microcode-based [[floating-point]] performance. The [[Intel 8087]] was the standard math coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088, operating on 80-bit numbers. Manufacturers like [[Cyrix]] (8087-compatible) and [[Weitek]] (''not'' 8087-compatible) eventually came up with high-performance floating-point coprocessors that competed with the 8087.\n\n==Chip versions==\nThe clock frequency was originally limited to 5&nbsp;MHz,<ref group=\"note\" >(IBM PC used 4.77&nbsp;MHz, 4/3 the standard NTSC [[color burst]] frequency)</ref> but the last versions in [[HMOS]] were specified for 10&nbsp;MHz. HMOS-III and [[CMOS]] versions were manufactured for a long time (at least a while into the 1990s) for [[embedded system]]s, although its successor, the [[Intel 80186|80186]]/[[Intel 80188|80188]] (which includes some on-chip peripherals), has been more popular for embedded use.\n\nThe 80C86, the CMOS version of the 8086, was used in the [[GRiDPad]], [[Toshiba T1200]], [[HP 110]], and finally the 1998\u20131999 [[Lunar Prospector]].\n\nFor the packaging, the Intel 8086 was available both in ceramic and plastic DIP packages.\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n| [[Image:Intel_D8086_CS.jpg|thumb|A ceramic D8086 variant]]\n| [[Image:Intel_P8086.jpg|thumb|A plastic P8086 variant]]\n|}\n\n===List of Intel 8086===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, the [[NEC V20]] and [[NEC V30]] pair were hardware-compatible with the 8088 and 8086 even though NEC made original Intel clones \u03bcPD8088D and \u03bcPD8086D respectively, but incorporated the instruction set of the 80186 along with some (but not all) of the 80186 speed enhancements, providing a drop-in capability to upgrade both instruction set and processing speed without manufacturers having to modify their designs. Such relatively simple and low-power 8086-compatible processors in CMOS are still used in embedded systems.\n\nThe electronics industry of the [[Soviet Union]] was able to replicate the 8086 through {{citation needed-span|both [[industrial espionage]] and reverse engineering|date=October 2013}}. The resulting chip, [[K1810VM86]], was binary and pin-compatible with the 8086.\n\ni8086 and i8088 were respectively the cores of the Soviet-made PC-compatible [[EC1831]] and [[EC1832]] desktops. (EC1831 is the EC identification of IZOT 1036C and EC1832 is the EC identification of IZOT 1037C, developed and manufactured in Bulgaria.

However, the EC1831 computer (IZOT 1036C) had significant hardware differences from the IBM PC prototype. The EC1831 was the first PC-compatible computer with dynamic bus sizing (US Pat.

{"title_page": "Independent Network Charismatic Christianity", "text_new": "{{short description|Movement within evangelical charismatic Christianity}}\n'''Independent Network Charismatic (INC) Christianity''' is a movement within [[evangelical charismatic movement|evangelical charismatic Christianity]] which is focused on the authority of charismatic [[apostle]]s and seeks the wholesale transformation of society. The term was first used in 2017 by [[sociology|sociologists]] Brad Christerson and Richard Flory in their book ''The Rise of Network Christianity: How Independent Leaders are Changing the Religious Landscape'' to describe the rapid growth of a form of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]] from 1970\u20132010, and has since been adopted by other commentators. The movement is distinguished from other forms of [[Christianity]] by its use of [[network governance]], based on networks of charismatic apostles, rather than more traditional church structures and hierarchies. These networks are sustained by the use of new communications technologies such as [[social media]], which both facilitates communication between leaders in the network and enables leaders to build a following which is not tied to a geographical area. It is characterised by belief in and encouragement of the use of the supernatural [[spiritual gifts|gifts of the Holy Spirit]], along with a focus on the transformation of society according to Christian values through [[prayer]] and by Christians reaching positions of leadership in the areas of business, government, media, arts and entertainment, education, family, and religion. INC Christianity tends to be [[conservatism|politically conservative]] and, in the US, associated with support for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians.\n\nThe movement has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s [[Calvary Chapel]] and [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard]] movements, with INC Christianity emerging as leaders in these movements sought to break free from organisational structures and formed informal affinity networks. According to Christerson and Flory, INC is the fastest growing Christian group in the US. As a movement, it has been particularly appealing to younger people, especially [[millennials]].\n\n==Distinguishing features==\n[[File:Bill Johnson teaching.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Johnson (pastor)|Bill Johnson]], senior leader of [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]]; both Johnson and the church have been described by various commentators as part of INC Christianity.]]\nIndependent Network Christianity is not a [[Religious denomination|denomination]] but rather a network of independent church and [[parachurch]] leaders. Whereas more traditional church movements (which, in this case, includes neo-Charismatic movements established in the 1970s such as Vineyard, Calvary Chapel, and [[Hope Chapel]]) have sought to build [[Church (congregation)|congregations]] and create franchises of affiliated churches, INC leaders prefer to try to directly influence the beliefs and practices of individuals, regardless of their personal and denominational affiliations. Individual [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] is regarded as more important than building church congregations; without any formal denomination or movement, individual leaders are connected by informal yet powerful co-operative networks.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, p. 8.</ref> INC can thus be described as operating a kind of [[network governance]].<ref>Smith 2018.</ref>\n\nLeaders in the INC network are referred to by insiders as apostles. Apostles tend to be [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]] in the [[Max Weber|Weberian]] sense of being seen to possess a supernatural authority which authenticates their ministry. An international network of apostles is facilitated by modern communication technologies such as the [[internet]], allowing the sharing of ideas and pursuit of joint projects without the limitations of operating within a hierarchical structure.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, pp. 50\u201453.</ref> These modern technologies allow INC leaders to build international ministries and followings, using the internet and [[social media]] to create interconnected online venues which do not depend of geographical ties. Followers engage primarily with leaders through these online forums, sometimes travelling to attend conferences.<ref>Smith 2018.</ref><ref>Ostling 2017.</ref>\n\nIn their book, Christerson & Flory cite [[Ch\u00e9 Ahn]] and his [[Harvest International Ministries]], [[Bill Johnson (pastor)|Bill Johnson]] and [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]], and [[Mike Bickle (minister)|Mike Bickle]] and the [[International House of Prayer]] as examples of INC leaders and organisations.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, 32\u201442.</ref> Richard Ostling has also named [[Cindy Jacobs]] and [[Chuck Pierce]] as INC leaders.<ref>Ostling 2017.</ref>\n\n===Beliefs===\nExisting within charismatic Christianity, INC leaders and organisations believe in the continued operation of the supernatural [[spiritual gift]]s of the [[Holy Spirit]], such as [[faith healing#|supernatural healing]], [[miracles]], [[prophecy]] and [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]].<ref>Smith 2018.</ref><ref>''Bringing Heaven to Earth'', 2:33.</ref> Supernatural activity is not limited to charismatic leaders; schools such as [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)#Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry|Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry]] teach their students to practice supernatural gifts themselves and use them in the community. Christerson and Flory argue that the promise of direct experience of the supernatural is attractive to young people and a key draw for them becoming involved in INC organisations.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, pp. 84\u201486.</ref> Dyron B.

The term was first used in 2017 by [[sociology|sociologists]] Brad Christerson and Richard Flory in their book ''The Rise of Network Christianity: How Independent Leaders are Changing the Religious Landscape'' to describe the rapid growth of a form of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]] from 1970\u20142010, and has since been adopted by other commentators. The movement is distinguished from other forms of [[Christianity]] by its use of [[network governance]], based on networks of charismatic apostles, rather than more traditional church structures and hierarchies. These networks are sustained by the use of new communications technologies such as [[social media]], which both facilitates communication between leaders in the network and enables leaders to build a following which is not tied to a geographical area. It is characterised by belief in and encouragement of the use of the supernatural [[spiritual gifts|gifts of the Holy Spirit]], along with a focus on the transformation of society according to Christian values through [[prayer]] and by Christians reaching positions of leadership in the areas of business, government, media, arts and entertainment, education, family, and religion. INC Christianity tends to be [[conservatism|politically conservative]] and, in the US, associated with support for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians.\n\nThe movement has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s [[Calvary Chapel]] and [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard]] movements, with INC Christianity emerging as leaders in these movements sought to break free from organisational structures and formed informal affinity networks. According to Christerson and Flory, INC is the fastest growing Christian group in the US. As a movement, it has been particularly appealing to younger people, especially [[millennials]].\n\n==Distinguishing features==\n[[File:Bill Johnson teaching.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Johnson (pastor)|Bill Johnson]], senior leader of [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]]; both Johnson and the church have been described by various commentators as part of INC Christianity.]]\nIndependent Network Christianity is not a [[Religious denomination|denomination]] but rather a network of independent church and [[parachurch]] leaders. Whereas more traditional church movements (which, in this case, includes neo-Charismatic movements established in the 1970s such as Vineyard, Calvary Chapel, and [[Hope Chapel]]) have sought to build [[Church (congregation)|congregations]] and create franchises of affiliated churches, INC leaders prefer to try to directly influence the beliefs and practices of individuals, regardless of their personal and denominational affiliations. Individual [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] is regarded as more important than building church congregations; without any formal denomination or movement, individual leaders are connected by informal yet powerful co-operative networks.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, p. 8.</ref> INC can thus be described as operating a kind of [[network governance]].<ref>Smith 2018.</ref>\n\nLeaders in the INC network are referred to by insiders as apostles. Apostles tend to be [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]] in the [[Max Weber|Weberian]] sense of being seen to possess a supernatural authority which authenticates their ministry. An international network of apostles is facilitated by modern communication technologies such as the [[internet]], allowing the sharing of ideas and pursuit of joint projects without the limitations of operating within a hierarchical structure.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, pp. 50\u201453.</ref> These modern technologies allow INC leaders to build international ministries and followings, using the internet and [[social media]] to create interconnected online venues which do not depend of geographical ties. Followers engage primarily with leaders through these online forums, sometimes travelling to attend conferences.<ref>Smith 2018.</ref><ref>Ostling 2017.</ref>\n\nIn their book, Christerson & Flory cite [[Ch\u00e9 Ahn]] and his [[Harvest International Ministries]], [[Bill Johnson (pastor)|Bill Johnson]] and [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]], and [[Mike Bickle (minister)|Mike Bickle]] and the [[International House of Prayer]] as examples of INC leaders and organisations.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, 32\u201442.</ref> Richard Ostling has also named [[Cindy Jacobs]] and [[Chuck Pierce]] as INC leaders.<ref>Ostling 2017.</ref>\n\n===Beliefs===\nExisting within charismatic Christianity, INC leaders and organisations believe in the continued operation of the supernatural [[spiritual gift]]s of the [[Holy Spirit]], such as [[faith healing#|supernatural healing]], [[miracles]], [[prophecy]] and [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]].<ref>Smith 2018.</ref><ref>''Bringing Heaven to Earth'', 2:33.</ref> Supernatural activity is not limited to charismatic leaders; schools such as [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)#Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry|Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry]] teach their students to practice supernatural gifts themselves and use them in the community. Christerson and Flory argue that the promise of direct experience of the supernatural is attractive to young people and a key draw for them becoming involved in INC organisations.<ref>Christerson & Flory 2017a, pp. 84\u201486.</ref> Dyron B.

Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].

IndyMac Bank also issued secondary mortgages secured by such housing, and other forms of consumer credit.\n\nIndyMac Bancorp, a [[holding company]] headquartered in [[Pasadena, California]], eventually acquired:\n* Financial Freedom, an originator and servicer of [[reverse mortgage]] loans, on July 16, 2004;\n* New York Mortgage Company, an East Coast mortgage bank, on April 2, 2007;\n* Barrington Capital Corporation, a West Coast mortgage bank, in September 2007.\n\n===Decline===\nThe primary causes of IndyMac's failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing [[Alt-A]] loans on a large scale. This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.\n\nIndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the California and Florida markets, and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\n\nIndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market.  IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.<ref name=\"ustreas.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-19 }} Audit Report Office of Inspector General</ref><ref>[http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09001.html FDIC Press Release]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201626/http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref>\n\n===Turning point===\nMay 12, 2008, in a small note in the \"Capital\" section of its what would become its last [[10-Q]] released before receivership, IndyMac revealed\u2014but did not admit\u2014that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency.\n\nIndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds including $160 million of those issued by Indymac and which the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. Indymac concluded that these downgrades would have negatively impacted the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, Indymac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. Indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below \u201cwell capitalized\u201d (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d (8-10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds. Indymac further warned that if its level of deposit liquidity was reduced in this way, the bank anticipated that it would reduce its assets and, most likely, curtail its lending activities.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#msef IndyMac Bankcorp 10-Q, Capital section]</ref> This statement was comparable to those adopted by other Southern California banks that were experiencing liquidity problems, such as Pomona First Federal (PFF) and Vineyard Bank.<ref>[http://armadaus.com/default_files/VineyardStudy.pdf Vineyard Bank Professional Case Study by Adam Anicich, UMD, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019000959/http://armadaus.com/default_files/VineyardStudy.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}</ref>\n\nSenator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of Indymac's total deposits and ask the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits.<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080701/indymac_schumer.html?.v=2 IndyMac Reassures Customers After Schumer Letter, AP]</ref> With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31,<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#svit IndyMac Bancorp 10-Q, Liquidity section]</ref> Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits. While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly, a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $500 million a month, had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30.\n\nIndyMac had suffered its third-consecutive quarterly loss. The bank reported that nonperforming loans totaled $1.85 billion as of March 31, increasing 40.56% from just the previous quarter. In the [[10-Q]] filing, the company stated it expected \u201cto have an even higher level of non-performing loans in the future due to the continued market disruption\u201d.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSN1336549320080513 IndyMac Slides After Analyst Says Needs Capital, Reuters]</ref>\n\nIndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital, such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008, after being cut in half the previous quarter. The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer.<ref>[http://theimbreport.com/ \"To-date, we have not been successful with these efforts....\" Company Blog]</ref><ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10416473/1/indymac-seeks-to-preserve-capital.html Indymac Seeks to Preserve Capital, TheStreet.Com]</ref>\n\nAccording to IndyMac's 10-Q, the bank's risk-based capital ratio had dropped to 10.26% as of March 31, from 10.81% the previous quarter. This ratio, which factors in asset quality and loan-loss reserve coverage, needs to be at least 10% for an institution to be considered well-capitalized under regulatory guidelines. IndyMac reported that the bank's risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10% mark. But it did not reveal some of that $47 million it claimed it had as of March 31, 2008 was actually a fiction.\n\n===Collapse===\n{{Wikinews|IndyMac Bank placed into conservatorship by US Government}}\n\nWhen home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits.<ref name=\"secinfo.com\">[http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#t7ow IndyMac 10-Q, Deposits/Retail Bank section]</ref> This [[bank run|\u201crun\u201d]] on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS.

Mr. Dochow allowed IndyMac Bank to receive $18 million from its parent company and book the money as if it had arrived by the end of the March 31 quarter when, in fact, it had arrived on May 9, only three days before IndyMac filed the 10-Q for that March 31 quarter. Had Mr. Dochow not allowed this irregular, retroactive contribution to capital, Indymac would have been forced to report that its capital had already slipped below the minimum level that regulators require for classifying banks as well capitalized, thus putting $6.8 billion in brokered deposits\u2014or 37 percent of Indymac's total deposits\u2014at risk, as noted in the previous section. It also would have prevented IndyMac from luring new customers by offering deposit rates which exceeded the limitations prescribed in FDIC regulations. In the final two months before IndyMac was placed into receivership, it was allowed to bring in at least $90 million in new uninsured deposits.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/>\n\nThe irregularity allowed by Mr. Dochow let IndyMac hide from publicity the fact that the threat to IndyMac's brokered deposits was not just a possible outcome but was a situation which had already begun\u2014months before the disclosure of Senator Schumer's concerns about OTS and IndyMac. Investigators reported that similar officially approved backdating occurred at four other institutions.\n\nMr. Dochow played a central role in the [[Savings and Loan crisis]] of the 1980s, overriding a recommendation by federal bank examiners in San Francisco to seize [[Lincoln Savings]], the giant savings and loan owned by [[Charles Keating]]. Lincoln became one of the biggest institutions to collapse. Mr. Keating served four and a half years in prison before his fraud and racketeering convictions were overturned. He later pleaded guilty to more limited charges, and was sentenced to the time already served.\n\n[[William K.

The U.S. government watchdog said the Pasadena, Calif., savings and loan pursued an overly aggressive growth strategy that included failing to verify borrowers' income and relying on expensive deposits to fund its operations. The Office of Thrift Supervision, IndyMac's regulator, recognized the red flags but did nothing to stop them, the Treasury inspector general said.\n\n\u201cWe found that OTS identified numerous problems and risks, including the quantity and poor quality of nontraditional mortgage products,\u201d the report said. Yet the \u201cOTS did not take aggressive action to stop those practices from continuing to proliferate,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe report also rejected much of the blame targeted at Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) Mr. Schumer came under fire last year (June 2008) for making public a letter he sent to regulators questioning IndyMac's ability to stay afloat as a business.\n\nThe Treasury inspector general found that the letter was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d in the timing of IndyMac's collapse, but that \u201cthe underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlso, the thrift was already on a course for probable failure by the time Mr. Schumer's letter was made public,\u201d the report said.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123569400027088259?mod=loomia&loomia_si=t0:a16:g2:r3:c0.107371:b0#articleTabs%3Darticle Regulators Missed Woes at IndyMac]</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2009, A spokesman said the U.S. Treasury Inspector General is reviewing actions by the Office of Thrift Supervision on backdating banks\u2019 capital injections after the regulator's acting director was removed and placed on leave.

IndyMac Bank also issued secondary mortgages secured by such housing, and other forms of consumer credit.\n\nIndyMac Bancorp, a [[holding company]] headquartered in [[Pasadena, California]], eventually acquired:\n* Financial Freedom, an originator and servicer of [[reverse mortgage]] loans, on July 16, 2004;\n* New York Mortgage Company, an East Coast mortgage bank, on April 2, 2007;\n* Barrington Capital Corporation, a West Coast mortgage bank, in September 2007.\n\n===Decline===\nThe primary causes of IndyMac\u2019s failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing [[Alt-A]] loans on a large scale. This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.\n\nIndyMac\u2019s aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the California and Florida markets, and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\n\nIndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower\u2019s income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac\u2019s business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower\u2019s needs, using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market.  IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.<ref name=\"ustreas.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-19 }} Audit Report Office of Inspector General</ref><ref>[http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09001.html FDIC Press Release]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201626/http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref>\n\n===Turning point===\nMay 12, 2008, in a small note in the \"Capital\" section of its what would become its last [[10-Q]] released before receivership, IndyMac revealed\u2014but did not admit\u2014that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency.\n\nIndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds including $160 million of those issued by Indymac and which the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. Indymac concluded that these downgrades would have negatively impacted the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, Indymac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. Indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below \u201cwell capitalized\u201d (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d (8-10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds. Indymac further warned that if its level of deposit liquidity was reduced in this way, the bank anticipated that it would reduce its assets and, most likely, curtail its lending activities.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#msef IndyMac Bankcorp 10-Q, Capital section]</ref> This statement was comparable to those adopted by other Southern California banks that were experiencing liquidity problems, such as Pomona First Federal (PFF) and Vineyard Bank.<ref>[http://armadaus.com/default_files/VineyardStudy.pdf Vineyard Bank Professional Case Study by Adam Anicich, UMD, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019000959/http://armadaus.com/default_files/VineyardStudy.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}</ref>\n\nSenator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of Indymac's total deposits and ask the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits.<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080701/indymac_schumer.html?.v=2 IndyMac Reassures Customers After Schumer Letter, AP]</ref> With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31,<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#svit IndyMac Bancorp 10-Q, Liquidity section]</ref> Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits. While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly, a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $500 million a month, had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30.\n\nIndyMac had suffered its third-consecutive quarterly loss. The bank reported that nonperforming loans totaled $1.85 billion as of March 31, increasing 40.56% from just the previous quarter. In the [[10-Q]] filing, the company stated it expected \u201cto have an even higher level of non-performing loans in the future due to the continued market disruption\u201d.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSN1336549320080513 IndyMac Slides After Analyst Says Needs Capital, Reuters]</ref>\n\nIndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital, such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008, after being cut in half the previous quarter. The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer.<ref>[http://theimbreport.com/ \"To-date, we have not been successful with these efforts....\" Company Blog]</ref><ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10416473/1/indymac-seeks-to-preserve-capital.html Indymac Seeks to Preserve Capital, TheStreet.Com]</ref>\n\nAccording to IndyMac's 10-Q, the bank's risk-based capital ratio had dropped to 10.26% as of March 31, from 10.81% the previous quarter. This ratio, which factors in asset quality and loan-loss reserve coverage, needs to be at least 10% for an institution to be considered well-capitalized under regulatory guidelines. IndyMac reported that the bank's risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10% mark. But it did not reveal some of that $47 million it claimed it had as of March 31, 2008 was actually a fiction.\n\n===Collapse===\n{{Wikinews|IndyMac Bank placed into conservatorship by US Government}}\n\nWhen home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits.<ref name=\"secinfo.com\">[http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#t7ow IndyMac 10-Q, Deposits/Retail Bank section]</ref> This [[bank run|\u201crun\u201d]] on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS.

IndyMac depositors, fearing the worst, withdrew about 7.5% of deposits from IndyMac.<ref name=\"secinfo.com\"/> Shifting focus from the financial condition of the bank to Senator Schumer, regulators and others in the financial sector quickly criticized Schumer for publicly releasing his letters, which they attempted to discredit and claimed further destabilized the bank.\n\nLeading the criticism was [[John M. Reich]], director of the OTS, who said that the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) and [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS) \u201cdo not comment on open and operating institutions\u201d. Mr. Reich spoke widely of  \u201cdissemination of incomplete or erroneous information\u201d and \u201crumors and innuendo\u201d and the \u201cstrict policy of privacy\u201d at OTS and FDIC.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2008/07/sen-charles-e-s.html |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Regulators to Schumer on IndyMac: Please shut up |date=August 2, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nMr. Reich would later be forced to remove OTS western regional director [[Darrel Dochow|Darrel W.

On February 12, 2009, Reich would resign and step down February 27, 2009, amidst a Treasury Department investigation and audit of OTS failures and misconduct. On March 26, 2009, Scott Polakoff\u2014former OTS senior deputy director and chief operating officer, hired by Reich, who became acting director upon Reich\u2019s departure\u2014was removed and placed on leave, pending an expanded Treasury Department investigation and audit.<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\">[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a_NjQg96RSdk Treasury\u2019s Watchdog Reviewing Backdating of Capital at Thrifts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321154128/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |date=2010-03-21 }}</ref> A February 26, 2009 report by the Office of Inspector General for the Treasury Department would later conclude that IndyMac was already a doomed institution and that [[Prompt Corrective Action]] should have been taken in May 2008. The IG dismissed the idea that Mr. Schumer's letters led to the downfall of the bank.<ref>https://www.propublica.org/article/new-audit-blasts-indymacs-chief-regulator New Audit Blasts IndyMac\u2019s Chief Regulator</ref>\n\n===Backdating scandal===\nIndyMac backdated an $18 million contribution from its parent company in order to preserve the bank's appearance as a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution. Mr. Dochow allowed IndyMac Bank to receive $18 million from its parent company and book the money as if it had arrived by the end of the March 31 quarter when, in fact, it had arrived on May 9, only three days before IndyMac filed the 10-Q for that March 31 quarter. Had Mr. Dochow not allowed this irregular, retroactive contribution to capital, Indymac would have been forced to report that its capital had already slipped below the minimum level that regulators require for classifying banks as well capitalized, thus putting $6.8 billion in brokered deposits\u2014or 37 percent of Indymac's total deposits\u2014at risk, as noted in the previous section. It also would have prevented IndyMac from luring new customers by offering deposit rates which exceeded the limitations prescribed in FDIC regulations. In the final two months before IndyMac was placed into receivership, it was allowed to bring in at least $90 million in new uninsured deposits.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/>\n\nThe irregularity allowed by Mr. Dochow let IndyMac hide from publicity the fact that the threat to IndyMac's brokered deposits was not just a possible outcome but was a situation which had already begun\u2014months before the disclosure of Senator Schumer's concerns about OTS and IndyMac. Investigators reported that similar officially approved backdating occurred at four other institutions.\n\nMr. Dochow played a central role in the [[Savings and Loan crisis]] of the 1980s, overriding a recommendation by federal bank examiners in San Francisco to seize [[Lincoln Savings]], the giant savings and loan owned by [[Charles Keating]]. Lincoln became one of the biggest institutions to collapse. Mr. Keating served four and a half years in prison before his fraud and racketeering convictions were overturned. He later pleaded guilty to more limited charges, and was sentenced to the time already served.\n\n[[William K. Black]], a senior bank regulator during the savings and loan crisis and the author of ''The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One'', said Mr. Dochow\u2019s lenience highlighted the longstanding unwillingness of the Office of Thrift Supervision to take charge.\n\n\u201cThe O.T.S. did nothing effective to regulate any of the specialized large nonprime lenders,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cSo what you got was what the F.B.I. accurately described as early as 2004 as an epidemic of mortgage fraud\u201d.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/business/23thrift.html |publisher=[[New York Times]] |title=Irregularity Uncovered at IndyMac |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2008-12-26 | first=Edmund L. | last=Andrews}}</ref>\n\n===Treasury Department Inspector General's investigation===\n\nOn February 26, 2009, the Treasury Department's inspector general concluded that federal regulators failed to catch warning signs that presaged the IndyMac Bank's collapse. The U.S. government watchdog said the Pasadena, Calif., savings and loan pursued an overly aggressive growth strategy that included failing to verify borrowers' income and relying on expensive deposits to fund its operations. The Office of Thrift Supervision, IndyMac's regulator, recognized the red flags but did nothing to stop them, the Treasury inspector general said.\n\n\u201cWe found that OTS identified numerous problems and risks, including the quantity and poor quality of nontraditional mortgage products,\u201d the report said. Yet the \u201cOTS did not take aggressive action to stop those practices from continuing to proliferate,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe report also rejected much of the blame targeted at Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) Mr. Schumer came under fire last year (June 2008) for making public a letter he sent to regulators questioning IndyMac's ability to stay afloat as a business.\n\nThe Treasury inspector general found that the letter was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d in the timing of IndyMac's collapse, but that \u201cthe underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlso, the thrift was already on a course for probable failure by the time Mr. Schumer's letter was made public,\u201d the report said.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123569400027088259?mod=loomia&loomia_si=t0:a16:g2:r3:c0.107371:b0#articleTabs%3Darticle Regulators Missed Woes at IndyMac]</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2009, A spokesman said the U.S. Treasury Inspector General is reviewing actions by the Office of Thrift Supervision on backdating banks\u2019 capital injections after the regulator\u2019s acting director was removed and placed on leave. Inspector General Eric Thorson gave findings \u201cregarding certain actions by management\u201d at OTS to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, replaced Acting Director Scott Polakoff pending an investigation, according to separate statements. John Bowman, the deputy director and chief counsel, was named the agency\u2019s acting director, OTS said. The OTS permitted five banks, including failed lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc., to revise capital reports for the first quarter to show higher levels after the period ended. The action allowed lenders, such as IndyMac, to avoid further regulatory restriction.<ref name=\"bloomberg.com\"/>\n\n===Other investigations===\nOn June 30, 2008, the Center for Responsible Lending, a Washington think tank, released a report compiling information from various lawsuits filed by customers and former employees of IndyMac Bank, and alleged that managers and supervisors were being pressured to approve loans or risk being fired.<ref>[http://www.responsiblelending.org/pdfs/indymac_what_went_wrong.pdf Indymac: What Went Wrong?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327052758/http://www.responsiblelending.org/pdfs/indymac_what_went_wrong.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.laobserved.com/biz/2008/06/indymac_the_new_coun.php LA Biz Observed: IndyMac a new Countrywide?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Before its collapse, IndyMac denied the allegations in the report.<ref>[http://www.laobserved.com/biz/2008/07/fbi_probing_indymac.php LA Biz Observed: FBI probing IndyMac<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 2008, an unnamed US government official said that the FBI was investigating IndyMac for possible fraud.

{"title_page": "Music of the Final Fantasy series", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Music of the ''Final Fantasy'' series}}\n{{Music of Final Fantasy}}\n''[[Final Fantasy]]'' is a [[media franchise]] created by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and owned by [[Square Enix]] that includes [[video game]]s, [[motion picture]]s, and other merchandise. The series began in 1987 as an [[Final Fantasy (video game)|eponymous]] [[role-playing video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Square (video game company)|Square]], spawning a video game series that became the central focus of the franchise.<ref name=\"Edge177\"/><ref name=\"IntroSE\"/> The '''music of the ''Final Fantasy'' series''' refers to the soundtracks of the ''Final Fantasy'' series of [[video game]]s, as well as the surrounding medley of soundtrack, arranged, and compilation albums. The series' music ranges from very light background music to emotionally intense interweavings of character and situation [[leitmotifs]].\n\nThe franchise includes a main series of numbered games as well as several [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series such as ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (series)|Crystal Chronicles]]'' and the ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' series. The primary composer of music for the main series was [[Nobuo Uematsu]], who single-handedly composed the soundtracks for the first nine games, as well as directing the production of many of the albums. Music for the spin-off series and main series games beginning with ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' was created by a variety of composers including [[Masashi Hamauzu]], [[Naoshi Mizuta]], [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], [[Kumi Tanioka]], and [[Yoko Shimomura]].\n\nThe majority of ''Final Fantasy'' games, including all of the main series games, have received a soundtrack album release. Many have also inspired [[orchestra]]l, [[vocal]], or [[piano]] [[arrangement]] albums. In addition to the regular albums, a number of [[List of Final Fantasy compilation albums|compilation albums]] of tracks from multiple games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups. Music from the original soundtracks of the games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing, while sheet music from the piano albums have been published by Yamaha Music Media. The franchise's music has been performed numerous times in concert tours and other live performances such as the ''[[Orchestral Game Music Concerts]]'', ''[[Symphonic Game Music Concerts]]'', and the ''[[Play! A Video Game Symphony]]'' and ''[[Video Games Live]]'' concert tours, as well as forming the basis of specific [[Final Fantasy concerts|''Final Fantasy'' concerts]] such as the ''Dear Friends'' and ''Distant Worlds'' concert tours.\n\n==Themes==\nAlthough each game in the ''Final Fantasy'' series offers a variety of music, there are some frequently reused themes. Most of the games open with a piece called \"Prelude\", which is based on a short piece by Bach that has evolved from a simple, two-voice, [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] theme in the early games to a complex melodic arrangement in recent installments.<ref name=\"GS-FFHistory-Series\">{{Cite document |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec2.html |title=Final Fantasy Series |work=The History of Final Fantasy |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Andrew |last=Vestal |accessdate=March 30, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-Evo\">{{cite web |url=http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |title=The Evolution of Final Fantasy |last=Kolan |first=Patrick |website=IGN |date=January 18, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812000715/http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"FF-Retro-1\">{{Cite document |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-i-final-fantasy/22250 |title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part I |publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 }}</ref> It has been described as being \"as recognizable in gaming circles as the [[Super Mario Bros. theme|''Super Mario Bros.'' theme]] or ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''{{'}}s title screen pop\".<ref name=\"IGN-Evo\"/> Battle victories in the first 10&nbsp;installments of the series were accompanied by a victory fanfare; this theme has become one of the most recognized pieces of music in the series.<ref name=\"RPGFAS\"/><ref name=\"SEMOASO\"/> [[Chocobo]]s and [[moogle]]s, two mascots for the series, each have their own themes.

Uematsu considered it a side job and was skeptical it would become any sort of full-time position. He said it was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Before joining Square, he composed music for television commercials.<ref name=\"SEU\"/> The first score he produced for Square was the soundtrack for the role-playing video game ''[[Cruise Chaser Blassty]]''. While working at Square, he met ''Final Fantasy'' creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who asked him if he wanted to compose music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to.<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Sakaguchi gave him a few instructions for the soundtrack of ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', Uematsu's 16th score,<ref name=\"FF-Retro-1\"/> such as the need for \"battle\" and \"town\" music, but left the remainder of the composing to Uematsu, aside from informing him of the specific technical limitations of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] system. The game was released in 1987.<ref name=\"FFNESrelease\"/>\n\n[[File:Nobuo Uematsu - Paris 4-dec-2004.JPG|thumb|left|Nobuo Uematsu served as the series' sole composer from its inception in 1986 until ''Final Fantasy X'' in 2001, when he was joined by two others.]]\nAfter the success of ''Final Fantasy I'', Uematsu remained with the series to compose the soundtrack to ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' (1988). Although ''I'' and ''II'' were composed separately, music from the two games have only been released on albums together. [[Music of Final Fantasy I and II|These albums]] include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums. ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' (1990) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded as one of the best soundtracks of any [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game.<ref name=\"RPGF3OSV\"/> [[Music of Final Fantasy III|The soundtrack]] spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as a disc of vocal and orchestral arrangements.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' (1991) was the first game in the series to be released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], and the resultant changes in the sound technology resulted in a composition process that Uematsu noted was \"excruciating\".<ref name=\"FF4OSVliner\"/> Uematsu has stated that, beginning with this soundtrack, he started to move away from the idea that the soundtrack had to be solely an orchestral score.<ref name=\"IGNNOBUOfeaturept2\"/> In addition to the soundtrack album, the music of ''IV'' was arranged and released in the style of [[Celtic music]], performed by [[M\u00e1ire Breatnach]]. It also sparked the release of an album of piano arrangements, something which would be repeated for every subsequent main-series game to date.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nHaving now gained experience with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' (1992), was much better than that of ''IV''. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two [[CD]]s long, a first for the series.<ref name=\"LINER\"/> Like ''IV'', the [[Music of Final Fantasy V|discography of ''Final Fantasy V'']] included an arranged and a piano album in addition to the main soundtrack album.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Square released ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' (1994), the last for the Super Famicom, and the accompanying soundtrack has been considered one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever composed.<ref name=\"RPGF6OST\"/> [[Music of Final Fantasy VI|The game's discography]] also includes orchestral and piano arrangement CDs, as well as [[Extended play|EPs]] of unreleased tracks and character themes. The soundtrack included the first attempt in the ''Final Fantasy'' series to include a [[vocal music|vocal track]], \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\", which has been described as \"one of Uematsu's greatest achievements\".<ref name=\"IGNBEST\"/> This track features an unintelligible synthesized \"voice\" that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the [[SPC700]] [[sound format]] chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track. The first actual vocals in a piece appeared in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nBeginning with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997), the series moved platforms to the [[PlayStation]]. While the media capabilities of the PlayStation allowed for [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD quality]] music, Uematsu opted instead to use Sequence format.<ref name=\"RPGFOST7\"/> The soundtrack album ran a record four discs, and Uematsu has stated that the move into the \"PlayStation era\", which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from [[synthesizer]]s, had \"definitely been the biggest change\" to [[video game music]].<ref name=\"EGNOBUOint\"/> ''VII'' was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals, \"One-Winged Angel\", which has been described as Uematsu's \"most recognizable contribution\" to the music of the series.<ref name=\"DitL_interview\">{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |title=A Day in the Life of Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3166165 |website=1UP.com |date=February 15, 2008 |accessdate= August 5, 2008 }}</ref> The piece, described as \"a fanfare to impending doom\", is said to not \"follow any normal genre rules\" and has been termed \"possibly the most innovative idea in the series' musical history.\"<ref name=\"RPGFOST7\"/> The lyrics of the piece, a [[Latin]] [[choir|choral]] track which plays at the climax of the game, were taken from the medieval poetry on which [[Carl Orff]] based his ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', specifically the songs \"Estuans Interius\", \"[[O Fortuna]]\", \"Veni, Veni, Venias\" and \"Ave Formosissima\".<ref name=\"RPGOWAinfo\"/> There was a plan to use a \"famous vocalist\" for the ending piece as a \"theme song\" for the game, but the idea was dropped due to time constraints and thematic concerns.<ref name=\"DitL_interview\"/><ref name=\"yoshinterview\"/> The idea of a theme song would be resurrected in the following installment of the series. In 2006, [[IGN]] ranked ''VII''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s music the best ''Final Fantasy'' soundtrack to date and cited the \"gripping\" character tracks and \"One-Winged Angel\" in particular as contributing factors.<ref name=\"IGNBEST\"/> The [[Music of Final Fantasy VII|discography of the original game]] only includes soundtrack, [[best of]], and piano albums.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/> However, beginning in 2005 Square Enix produced a collection of media centered on the game and world of ''Final Fantasy VII'' entitled the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]''. This collection has produced five additional soundtrack albums, each for a different game or animation.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' (1999), unlike that of ''VI'' and ''VII'', did not include character themes, as Uematsu felt they would not be effective.<ref name=\"lim\"/> In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated \"the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game\".<ref name=\"IGNinterview\"/> Although the idea had not been used in the previous game, he thought a [[ballad (music)|ballad]] would closely relate to the theme and characters of ''VIII'', and composed \"Eyes on Me\", performed by [[Faye Wong]].<ref name=\"lim\"/> The song was released as a [[Single (music)|single]], while Square produced soundtrack, orchestral, and piano albums for the [[Music of Final Fantasy VIII|game's music]].<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nThe music of ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', (2000), was based around a theme of [[Renaissance music]], and was heavily inspired by previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, incorporating themes and motifs from earlier soundtracks. Uematsu felt previous games ''VII'' and ''VIII'' had a mood of realism, but that ''Final Fantasy IX'' was more of a fantasy, so \"a serious piece as well as silly, fun pieces could fit in\".<ref name=\"fami-interview\">{{Cite document |title=Nobuo Uematsu Interview by Weekly Famitsu |url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/nobrpg.html |publisher=[[Famitsu]] |accessdate=June 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920025801/http://www.nobuouematsu.com/nobrpg.html |archivedate=September 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"ign-interview\">{{cite web |title=Nobuo Uematsu Interview by PSX IGN |url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/round.html |website=IGN |accessdate=June 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205182208/http://www.nobuouematsu.com/round.html |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}</ref> Uematsu has claimed several times that the music of ''IX'' is his favorite work, as well as the one he is most proud of.<ref name=\"NEONOBUOint\"/><ref name=\"GINOBUOint\"/> Like ''Final Fantasy VIII'', ''IX'' included a vocal theme, \"Melodies of Life\", which was sung by [[Emiko Shiratori]].

Released on the [[PlayStation 2]], the score was assisted by [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]]. Uematsu contributed 51&nbsp;tracks, Hamauzu contributed 20&nbsp;tracks and Nakano contributed 18&nbsp;tracks to the game.<ref name=\"COMros\"/> The two other composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu's while still working together.<ref name=\"RBNU\"/> The [[Music of Final Fantasy X|discography for the game]] includes the soundtrack album, piano, and vocal arrangement albums, and an EP of tracks by Uematsu inspired by the game. The theme song for the game, \"Suteki da ne\", which translates to \"Isn't it Wonderful?\", was written by Nobuo Uematsu and [[Kazushige Nojima]] and was sung by [[Music of Japan|Japanese folk]] singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as \"[[Rikki (Japanese singer)|Rikki]]\", whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an [[Okinawa]]n atmosphere.<ref name=\"interviewsrikki\"/> \"Suteki da ne\" is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of ''Final Fantasy X'', and was released as a single.<ref name=\"RPGFFFXsingle\"/>\n\nUematsu, along with [[Naoshi Mizuta]] and [[Kumi Tanioka]], composed the score for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' (2002). It was the last ''Final Fantasy'' soundtrack that Uematsu was a main composer for until ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]'', as he resigned from Square Enix in November 2004.<ref name=\"Edge177\"/> The expansion packs were mostly scored by Mizuta alone. The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in [[Esperanto]]. According to Uematsu, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers' hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation.<ref name=\"esper\"/> The game and each of its four expansion packs have produced a soundtrack album; the [[Music of Final Fantasy XI|discography for the game]] also includes two piano albums, an album of unreleased tracks, two arranged albums, and a single for its vocal theme, \"Distant World\", which was composed by Uematsu and performed by Japanese opera singer Izumi Masuda.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n[[File:Masashi Hamauzu Jan 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Masashi Hamauzu was the lead composer of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels]]\n''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' (2006) was composed by [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], with six other compositions by [[Hayato Matsuo]] and [[Masaharu Iwata]]. Uematsu only contributed the game's ending theme song, \"[[Kiss Me Good-Bye]]\", which was performed by [[Angela Aki]].<ref name=\"GSUEMATSUleaves\"/> Violinist [[Taro Hakase]] also contributed a piece named \"Symphonic Poem {{'}}Hope{{'}}\", featured during the game's ending credits. Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by [[Yasumi Matsuno]], the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced.<ref name=\"ignsaki\"/> Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence.<ref name=\"sakimoto\"/><ref name=\"ignsaki2\"/> Sakimoto did not meet with Uematsu for direction on creating the soundtrack and tried to avoid copying Uematsu's style from previous ''Final Fantasy'' soundtracks. However, he did attempt to ensure that his style would mesh with Uematsu's \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" and the overall vision of the series.<ref name=\"ignsaki\"/> The [[Music of Final Fantasy XII|current discography]], while originally limited to the soundtrack album and singles for \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" and \"Symphonic Poem {{'}}Hope{{'}}\", was late in 2012 given an album of piano arrangements like most prior soundtracks in the series.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' (2009) was composed by Masashi Hamauzu.<ref name=\"IGNE32006\"/> Although its main theme  was originally announced to be composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Uematsu instead gave it to Hamauzu to compose after being selected as the composer for ''Final Fantasy XIV'', making ''XIII'' the first game in the main series to not have any work by Uematsu.<ref name=\"SEMONOBUOnoFF13\"/> The game has sparked the release of a soundtrack album, an arranged album, two [[gramophone record]] albums of music from the soundtrack, a piano album, and a single of the game's theme song {{nihongo|\"Because You're Here\"|\u541b\u304c\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3089|[[Kimi ga Iru Kara (Sayuri Sugawara song)|Kimi ga Iru Kara]]}}, sung by Sayuri Sugawara.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/><ref name=\"SEMOFF13theme\"/> The international versions of ''XIII'' feature the song \"My Hands\" sung by British singer [[Leona Lewis]] from her second album ''[[Echo (Leona Lewis album)|Echo]]''.\n\nUematsu was hired through his \"Smile Please\" studio to score the original ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]'', the first game in the series in a decade to have a score completely composed by him at release.<ref name=\"FFXIVOfficialSite\"/> The theme song ''Answers'' was sung by Susan Calloway, with lyrics from game writers Yaeko Sato and Michal-Christopher Koji Fox.

''Final Fantasy XV'' was her first project for the series. Shimomura was brought on board the project in 2006, when it was a spin-off title called ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', and stayed in her role during the game's ten-year [[Development of Final Fantasy XV|development cycle]]. Her music, based around themes of \"friendship\" and \"filial bonds\", incorporates multiple musical genres including Shimomura's classical style, [[Bossa nova]] and [[Blues|American Blues]]. Several tracks, including the main theme \"Somnus\", feature [[Latin]] lyrics written by the game's original director [[Tetsuya Nomura]]. ''Final Fantasy XV'' was expanded into a multimedia project dubbed the \"''Final Fantasy XV'' Universe\", for which other composers were hired; [[John R. Graham (composer)|John R.

Other titles in the series are ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'', the soundtrack of which was composed by [[Masashi Hamauzu]], ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'', which was primarily composed by Takeharu Ishimoto with a few tracks provided by Kazuhiko Toyama, and ''[[Last Order: Final Fantasy VII]]'', also composed by Ishimoto.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n''Advent Children'' featured a song by former [[Japanese rock]] band [[Bo\u00f8wy]]'s singer [[Kyosuke Himuro]] in its ending credits, the ''Dirge of Cerberus'' soundtrack contained two songs by [[Gackt]], including its theme song \"[[Redemption (Gackt song)|Redemption]]\", and ''Crisis Core''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s theme song, \"[[Clap & Love/Why|Why]]\", was performed by [[Ayaka]].

Despite having composed the majority of the soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy X'', Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any music to the project. No tracks from ''X'' or other games in the series were used in the game. In an attempt to make a different style of music for the game than previous franchise titles, Square brought [[Noriko Matsueda]] and [[Takahito Eguchi]] on board to compose the music for ''X-2'', as the developers felt they were the \"perfect fit\" to incorporate a \"pop\" style into the music.<ref name=\"igndeveloperinterview\"/> The game includes two songs with vocalized elements, one of which, the [[J-Pop]] song \"real Emotion\", was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara. The other, [[J-Pop]] [[ballad]] \"1000 Words\", was written by scenario writers [[Kazushige Nojima]] and Daisuke Watanabe. Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track.

After ''Final Fantasy XII'' was set in the same world, [[Ivalice]], as the two games in the series ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' (1997) and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' (2003), Square Enix announced that all future games set in the game world would be part of the new ''Ivalice Alliance'' subseries. These games to date include ''[[Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings]]'' (2007), ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions]]'' (2007), ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift]]'' (2007), and ''[[Final Fantasy XII#Versions and merchandise|Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"RPGFFFTgames\"/>\n\nThe music of these games has been primarily composed by [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], who also composed the main-series game set in Ivalice, ''Final Fantasy XII''.

Sakimoto again was the composer for ''Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift'', though this time he was supported by composers from his studio [[Basiscape]], and it too sparked a soundtrack album release. He also scored ''Revenant Wings'', though it primarily consisted of arrangements of his previous work and has not been released as a separate album, and his work on ''Tactics'' was used as the score for the spinoff series ''[[Crystal Defenders]]''.<ref name=\"SEMOFFTACD\"/>\n\n====''Crystal Chronicles''====\n{{main|Music of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series}}\n[[File:Kumi Tanioka 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Kumi Tanioka was the main composer of the ''Crystal Chronicles'' series.]]\nAnother spin-off of the main series, the ''Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles'' series consists of ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles|Crystal Chronicles]]'' (2004), its sequel ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates|Ring of Fates]]'' (2007), and their spin-offs ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King|My Life as a King]]'' (2008), ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time|Echoes of Time]]'' (2009), ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord|My Life as a Darklord]]'' (2009), and the newest title ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers|The Crystal Bearers]]'' (2009).

These games include [[Mystery Dungeon]] installments and a variety of [[minigame]] collections over a wide variety of video game consoles. The series includes over a dozen games, most of which have been released only in Japan.<ref name=\"GTFFRp10\"/> The soundtracks to the games have been composed by a wide variety of composers, and many of the soundtracks are composed primarily of arranged versions of tracks from previous ''Final Fantasy'' soundtracks, especially the \"chocobo\" theme.<ref name=\"SEMOCMD1\"/>\n\nOnly some of the games have led to separate soundtrack releases. The first of these was {{nihongo|''[[Chocobo (series)#Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon|Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon]]''|\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30dc\u306e\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u306a\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3000\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30af|''Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon''}}, which was scored by Masashi Hamauzu and inspired an orchestral arrangement album also composed by Hamauzu.<ref name=\"liner2\"/> The soundtrack of [[Chocobo (series)#Chocobo's Dungeon 2|''Chocobo's Dungeon 2'']] was composed by Kumi Tanioka, Yasuhiro Kawakami, Tsuyoshi Sekito, [[Kenji Ito]], and Nobuo Uematsu.<ref name=\"RPGFCMDreview\"/> The games whose soundtracks were primarily composed of previous ''Final Fantasy'' and ''Chocobo'' tracks were ''[[Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon]]'', which was arranged by Yuzo Takahashi of Joe Down Studio, ''[[Chocobo Racing]]'', whose original tracks were composed by Kenji Ito, and ''[[Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales]]''. The sequel to ''Chocobo Tales'', ''Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes'', contains mainly original works, and the two games were scored by Yuzo Takahashi. Unlike the other ''Chocobo'' games, they had a joint soundtrack album release, while ''Chocobo Tales'' had a previous download-only \"best of\" album.<ref name=\"SEMOCMBreview\"/>\n\n====Others====\nOther spin-offs of the main ''Final Fantasy'' series include ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'' (1991), a spin-off game later also considered as the first game in the [[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]], which had references to ''Final Fantasy'' removed in its remake, ''[[Sword of Mana]]''.<ref name=\"FFA\"/> It was scored by Kenji Ito, with one track by Uematsu.

Many have also inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums as well. These albums have been produced and reprinted by a number of different companies, including [[DigiCube]], [[NTT Publishing]], Square Enix itself, and many others. Additionally, many albums have been made available at the [[iTunes Music Store]].<ref name=\"SEdownload\"/> In addition to the regular albums, a number of [[List of Final Fantasy compilation albums|compilation albums]] of pieces from several ''Final Fantasy'' games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups, both officially and unofficially. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles. Square Enix produced the first album, ''Final Fantasy 1987\u20131994'' (1994) and has since produced 13&nbsp;albums, leading up to ''Final Fantasy Remix'' (2008). The first compilation album produced by an outside group was ''The Best of Final Fantasy 1994\u20131999: A Musical Tribute'', released in 2000 by Sherman F.

All piece in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. \"Best of\" collections and arrangements for guitar solos and piano duets are also available.<ref name=\"SSsheet\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the actual piano sheet music from each of the ten ''Final Fantasy Piano Collections'' albums has been published as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media.<ref name=\"YAMAHA\"/> Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. Sheet music for the ''Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections'' album included in the ''Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set'' was included in that box set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere;<ref name=\"RPGFPB\"/> sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.<ref name=\"YAMAHA\"/>\n\n==Public performances==\n{{see also|Final Fantasy concerts}}\n[[File:Dear Friends - Final Fantasy VIII.jpg|thumb|[[Rinoa Heartilly]] shown at the [[Los Angeles]] ''Dear Friends'' concert]]\nMusic from ''Final Fantasy'' has been performed numerous times in concert tours and other live performances.

After the success of the ''20020220 Music from Final Fantasy'' concert in 2002, a recording of which was produced as an album, the ''Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy'', was launched in Japan in 2004.

The series began in 1987 as an [[Final Fantasy (video game)|eponymous]] [[role-playing video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Square (video game company)|Square]], spawning a video game series that became the central focus of the franchise.<ref name=\"Edge177\"/><ref name=\"IntroSE\"/> The '''music of the ''Final Fantasy'' series''' refers to the soundtracks of the ''Final Fantasy'' series of [[video game]]s, as well as the surrounding medley of soundtrack, arranged, and compilation albums. The series' music ranges from very light background music to emotionally intense interweavings of character and situation [[leitmotifs]].\n\nThe franchise includes a main series of numbered games as well as several [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series such as ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (series)|Crystal Chronicles]]'' and the ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' series. The primary composer of music for the main series was [[Nobuo Uematsu]], who single-handedly composed the soundtracks for the first nine games, as well as directing the production of many of the albums. Music for the spin-off series and main series games beginning with ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' was created by a variety of composers including [[Masashi Hamauzu]], [[Naoshi Mizuta]], [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], [[Kumi Tanioka]], and [[Yoko Shimomura]].\n\nThe majority of ''Final Fantasy'' games, including all of the main series games, have received a soundtrack album release. Many have also inspired [[orchestra]]l, [[vocal]], or [[piano]] [[arrangement]] albums. In addition to the regular albums, a number of [[List of Final Fantasy compilation albums|compilation albums]] of tracks from multiple games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups. Music from the original soundtracks of the games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing, while sheet music from the piano albums have been published by Yamaha Music Media. The franchise's music has been performed numerous times in concert tours and other live performances such as the ''[[Orchestral Game Music Concerts]]'', ''[[Symphonic Game Music Concerts]]'', and the ''[[Play! A Video Game Symphony]]'' and ''[[Video Games Live]]'' concert tours, as well as forming the basis of specific [[Final Fantasy concerts|''Final Fantasy'' concerts]] such as the ''Dear Friends'' and ''Distant Worlds'' concert tours.\n\n==Themes==\nAlthough each game in the ''Final Fantasy'' series offers a variety of music, there are some frequently reused themes. Most of the games open with a piece called \"Prelude\", which is based on a short piece by Bach that has evolved from a simple, two-voice, [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] theme in the early games to a complex melodic arrangement in recent installments.<ref name=\"GS-FFHistory-Series\">{{Cite document |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec2.html |title=Final Fantasy Series |work=The History of Final Fantasy |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Andrew |last=Vestal |accessdate=March 30, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-Evo\">{{cite web |url=http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |title=The Evolution of Final Fantasy |last=Kolan |first=Patrick |website=IGN |date=January 18, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812000715/http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"FF-Retro-1\">{{Cite document |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-i-final-fantasy/22250 |title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part I |publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 }}</ref> It has been described as being \"as recognizable in gaming circles as the [[Super Mario Bros. theme|''Super Mario Bros.'' theme]] or ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''{{'}}s title screen pop\".<ref name=\"IGN-Evo\"/> Battle victories in the first 10&nbsp;installments of the series were accompanied by a victory fanfare; this theme has become one of the most recognized pieces of music in the series.<ref name=\"RPGFAS\"/><ref name=\"SEMOASO\"/> [[Chocobo]]s and [[moogle]]s, two mascots for the series, each have their own themes.

Uematsu considered it a side job and was skeptical it would become any sort of full-time position. He said it was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Before joining Square, he composed music for television commercials.<ref name=\"SEU\"/> The first score he produced for Square was the soundtrack for the role-playing video game ''[[Cruise Chaser Blassty]]''. While working at Square, he met ''Final Fantasy'' creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who asked him if he wanted to compose music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to.<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Sakaguchi gave him a few instructions for the soundtrack of ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', Uematsu's 16th score,<ref name=\"FF-Retro-1\"/> such as the need for \"battle\" and \"town\" music, but left the remainder of the composing to Uematsu, aside from informing him of the specific technical limitations of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] system. The game was released in 1987.<ref name=\"FFNESrelease\"/>\n\n[[File:Nobuo Uematsu - Paris 4-dec-2004.JPG|thumb|left|Nobuo Uematsu served as the series' sole composer from its inception in 1986 until ''Final Fantasy X'' in 2001, when he was joined by two others.]]\nAfter the success of ''Final Fantasy I'', Uematsu remained with the series to compose the soundtrack to ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' (1988). Although ''I'' and ''II'' were composed separately, music from the two games have only been released on albums together. [[Music of Final Fantasy I and II|These albums]] include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums. ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' (1990) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded as one of the best soundtracks of any [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game.<ref name=\"RPGF3OSV\"/> [[Music of Final Fantasy III|The soundtrack]] spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as a disc of vocal and orchestral arrangements.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' (1991) was the first game in the series to be released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], and the resultant changes in the sound technology resulted in a composition process that Uematsu noted was \"excruciating\".<ref name=\"FF4OSVliner\"/> Uematsu has stated that, beginning with this soundtrack, he started to move away from the idea that the soundtrack had to be solely an orchestral score.<ref name=\"IGNNOBUOfeaturept2\"/> In addition to the soundtrack album, the music of ''IV'' was arranged and released in the style of [[Celtic music]], performed by [[M\u00e1ire Breatnach]]. It also sparked the release of an album of piano arrangements, something which would be repeated for every subsequent main-series game to date.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nHaving now gained experience with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' (1992), was much better than that of ''IV''. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two [[CD]]s long, a first for the series.<ref name=\"LINER\"/> Like ''IV'', the [[Music of Final Fantasy V|discography of ''Final Fantasy V'']] included an arranged and a piano album in addition to the main soundtrack album.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Square released ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' (1994), the last for the Super Famicom, and the accompanying soundtrack has been considered one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever composed.<ref name=\"RPGF6OST\"/> [[Music of Final Fantasy VI|The game's discography]] also includes orchestral and piano arrangement CDs, as well as [[Extended play|EPs]] of unreleased tracks and character themes. The soundtrack included the first attempt in the ''Final Fantasy'' series to include a [[vocal music|vocal track]], \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\", which has been described as \"one of Uematsu's greatest achievements\".<ref name=\"IGNBEST\"/> This track features an unintelligible synthesized \"voice\" that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the [[SPC700]] [[sound format]] chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track. The first actual vocals in a piece appeared in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nBeginning with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997), the series moved platforms to the [[PlayStation]]. While the media capabilities of the PlayStation allowed for [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD quality]] music, Uematsu opted instead to use Sequence format.<ref name=\"RPGFOST7\"/> The soundtrack album ran a record four discs, and Uematsu has stated that the move into the \"PlayStation era\", which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from [[synthesizer]]s, had \"definitely been the biggest change\" to [[video game music]].<ref name=\"EGNOBUOint\"/> ''VII'' was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals, \"One-Winged Angel\", which has been described as Uematsu's \"most recognizable contribution\" to the music of the series.<ref name=\"DitL_interview\">{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |title=A Day in the Life of Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3166165 |website=1UP.com |date=February 15, 2008 |accessdate= August 5, 2008 }}</ref> The piece, described as \"a fanfare to impending doom\", is said to not \"follow any normal genre rules\" and has been termed \"possibly the most innovative idea in the series' musical history.\"<ref name=\"RPGFOST7\"/> The lyrics of the piece, a [[Latin]] [[choir|choral]] track which plays at the climax of the game, were taken from the medieval poetry on which [[Carl Orff]] based his ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', specifically the songs \"Estuans Interius\", \"[[O Fortuna]]\", \"Veni, Veni, Venias\" and \"Ave Formosissima\".<ref name=\"RPGOWAinfo\"/> There was a plan to use a \"famous vocalist\" for the ending piece as a \"theme song\" for the game, but the idea was dropped due to time constraints and thematic concerns.<ref name=\"DitL_interview\"/><ref name=\"yoshinterview\"/> The idea of a theme song would be resurrected in the following installment of the series. In 2006, [[IGN]] ranked ''VII''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s music the best ''Final Fantasy'' soundtrack to date and cited the \"gripping\" character tracks and \"One-Winged Angel\" in particular as contributing factors.<ref name=\"IGNBEST\"/> The [[Music of Final Fantasy VII|discography of the original game]] only includes soundtrack, [[best of]], and piano albums.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/> However, beginning in 2005 Square Enix produced a collection of media centered on the game and world of ''Final Fantasy VII'' entitled the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]''. This collection has produced five additional soundtrack albums, each for a different game or animation.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' (1999), unlike that of ''VI'' and ''VII'', did not include character themes, as Uematsu felt they would not be effective.<ref name=\"lim\"/> In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated \"the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game\".<ref name=\"IGNinterview\"/> Although the idea had not been used in the previous game, he thought a [[ballad (music)|ballad]] would closely relate to the theme and characters of ''VIII'', and composed \"Eyes on Me\", performed by [[Faye Wong]].<ref name=\"lim\"/> The song was released as a [[Single (music)|single]], while Square produced soundtrack, orchestral, and piano albums for the [[Music of Final Fantasy VIII|game's music]].<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\nThe music of ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', (2000), was based around a theme of [[Renaissance music]], and was heavily inspired by previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, incorporating themes and motifs from earlier soundtracks.

Released on the [[PlayStation 2]], the score was assisted by [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]]. Uematsu contributed 51&nbsp;tracks, Hamauzu contributed 20&nbsp;tracks and Nakano contributed 18&nbsp;tracks to the game.<ref name=\"COMros\"/> The two other composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu's while still working together.<ref name=\"RBNU\"/> The [[Music of Final Fantasy X|discography for the game]] includes the soundtrack album, piano, and vocal arrangement albums, and an EP of tracks by Uematsu inspired by the game. The theme song for the game, \"Suteki da ne\", which translates to \"Isn't it Wonderful?\", was written by Nobuo Uematsu and [[Kazushige Nojima]] and was sung by [[Music of Japan|Japanese folk]] singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as \"[[Rikki (Japanese singer)|Rikki]]\", whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an [[Okinawa]]n atmosphere.<ref name=\"interviewsrikki\"/> \"Suteki da ne\" is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of ''Final Fantasy X'', and was released as a single.<ref name=\"RPGFFFXsingle\"/>\n\nUematsu, along with [[Naoshi Mizuta]] and [[Kumi Tanioka]], composed the score for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' (2002). It was the last ''Final Fantasy'' soundtrack that Uematsu was a main composer for until ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]'', as he resigned from Square Enix in November 2004.<ref name=\"Edge177\"/> The expansion packs were mostly scored by Mizuta alone. The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in [[Esperanto]]. According to Uematsu, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers' hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation.<ref name=\"esper\"/> The game and each of its four expansion packs have produced a soundtrack album; the [[Music of Final Fantasy XI|discography for the game]] also includes two piano albums, an album of unreleased tracks, two arranged albums, and a single for its vocal theme, \"Distant World\", which was composed by Uematsu and performed by Japanese opera singer Izumi Masuda.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n[[File:Masashi Hamauzu Jan 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Masashi Hamauzu was the lead composer of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels]]\n''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' (2006) was composed by [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], with six other compositions by [[Hayato Matsuo]] and [[Masaharu Iwata]].

Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by [[Yasumi Matsuno]], the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced.<ref name=\"ignsaki\"/> Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence.<ref name=\"sakimoto\"/><ref name=\"ignsaki2\"/> Sakimoto did not meet with Uematsu for direction on creating the soundtrack and tried to avoid copying Uematsu's style from previous ''Final Fantasy'' soundtracks. However, he did attempt to ensure that his style would mesh with Uematsu's \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" and the overall vision of the series.<ref name=\"ignsaki\"/> The [[Music of Final Fantasy XII|current discography]], while originally limited to the soundtrack album and singles for \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" and \"Symphonic Poem {{'}}Hope{{'}}\", was late in 2012 given an album of piano arrangements like most prior soundtracks in the series.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' (2009) was composed by Masashi Hamauzu.<ref name=\"IGNE32006\"/> Although its main theme  was originally announced to be composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Uematsu instead gave it to Hamauzu to compose after being selected as the composer for ''Final Fantasy XIV'', making ''XIII'' the first game in the main series to not have any work by Uematsu.<ref name=\"SEMONOBUOnoFF13\"/> The game has sparked the release of a soundtrack album, an arranged album, two [[gramophone record]] albums of music from the soundtrack, a piano album, and a single of the game's theme song {{nihongo|\"Because You're Here\"|\u541b\u304c\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3089|[[Kimi ga Iru Kara (Sayuri Sugawara song)|Kimi ga Iru Kara]]}}, sung by Sayuri Sugawara.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/><ref name=\"SEMOFF13theme\"/> The international versions of ''XIII'' feature the song \"My Hands\" sung by British singer [[Leona Lewis]] from her second album ''[[Echo (Leona Lewis album)|Echo]]''.\n\nUematsu was hired through his \"Smile Please\" studio to score the original ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]'', the first game in the series in a decade to have a score completely composed by him at release.<ref name=\"FFXIVOfficialSite\"/> The theme song ''Answers'' was sung by Susan Calloway, with lyrics from game writers Yaeko Sato and Michal-Christopher Koji Fox.

''Final Fantasy XV'' was her first project for the series. Shimomura was brought on board the project in 2006, when it was a spin-off title called ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', and stayed in her role during the game's ten-year [[Development of Final Fantasy XV|development cycle]]. Her music, based around themes of \"friendship\" and \"filial bonds\", incorporates multiple musical genres including Shimomura's classical style, [[Bossa nova]] and [[Blues|American Blues]]. Several tracks, including the main theme \"Somnus\", feature [[Latin]] lyrics written by the game's original director [[Tetsuya Nomura]]. ''Final Fantasy XV'' was expanded into a multimedia project dubbed the \"''Final Fantasy XV'' Universe\", for which other composers were hired; [[John R. Graham (composer)|John R.

English indie rock band [[Florence and the Machine]] collaborated on three songs for the game, including a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Ben E. King]]'s \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E.

The first announced element of the series was ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'', an animated sequel to the original game, though the first to be released was the mobile phone game ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]''. ''Before Crisis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s soundtrack was composed by [[Takeharu Ishimoto]], while ''Advent Children'' was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, [[Keiji Kawamori]], [[Kenichiro Fukui]], and [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]]. Other titles in the series are ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'', the soundtrack of which was composed by [[Masashi Hamauzu]], ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'', which was primarily composed by Takeharu Ishimoto with a few tracks provided by Kazuhiko Toyama, and ''[[Last Order: Final Fantasy VII]]'', also composed by Ishimoto.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n''Advent Children'' featured a song by former [[Japanese rock]] band [[Bo\u00f8wy]]'s singer [[Kyosuke Himuro]] in its ending credits, the ''Dirge of Cerberus'' soundtrack contained two songs by [[Gackt]], including its theme song \"[[Redemption (Gackt song)|Redemption]]\", and ''Crisis Core''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s theme song, \"[[Clap & Love/Why|Why]]\", was performed by [[Ayaka]]. Each element of the series sparked its own soundtrack album except for ''Before Crisis'' and ''Last Order'', which had their soundtracks released together in one album.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/> ''Dirge of Cerberus'' also had a download-only soundtrack album for its Japan-only multiplayer mode, while \"Redemption\" and \"Why\" each had a single release by their respective artists.<ref name=\"SECCFF7\"/><ref name=\"RPGFDOCreview\"/>\n\n====''Final Fantasy X-2''====\n{{Main|Music of Final Fantasy X-2}}\n''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'' (2003), was the first direct video game sequel to any ''Final Fantasy'' game. Despite having composed the majority of the soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy X'', Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any music to the project. No tracks from ''X'' or other games in the series were used in the game. In an attempt to make a different style of music for the game than previous franchise titles, Square brought [[Noriko Matsueda]] and [[Takahito Eguchi]] on board to compose the music for ''X-2'', as the developers felt they were the \"perfect fit\" to incorporate a \"pop\" style into the music.<ref name=\"igndeveloperinterview\"/> The game includes two songs with vocalized elements, one of which, the [[J-Pop]] song \"real Emotion\", was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara. The other, [[J-Pop]] [[ballad]] \"1000 Words\", was written by scenario writers [[Kazushige Nojima]] and Daisuke Watanabe. Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track. Both songs were sung by [[Jade Villalon]] from [[Sweetbox]] in the English version of the game, and are available as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album ''[[Adagio (Sweetbox album)|Adagio]]''.<ref name=\"FFMmisc\"/> In the Japanese version of the game both the songs were sung by [[Kumi Koda]] and were released as a single entitled ''real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba''. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single ''[[Come with Me (Kumi Koda song)|Come with Me]]'', with slightly different versions of the lyrics than Jade. In addition to ''Come with Me'', the [[Music of Final Fantasy X-2|collection of music]] for ''Final Fantasy X-2'' includes the two-disc soundtrack album, a piano album, a soundtrack album for the ''Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission'' version of the game, a single for the song \"Eternity ~ Memory of Lightwaves\", and a set of three singles themed around the three main characters of the game.<ref name=\"ListofAlbums\"/>\n\n====''Tactics'' and ''Ivalice Alliance''====\n{{Main|Music of the Final Fantasy Tactics series}}\nThe ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' series is a spin-off of the main ''Final Fantasy'' series, consisting of primarily [[tactical role-playing game]]s with heavy thematic similarities to the main series. After ''Final Fantasy XII'' was set in the same world, [[Ivalice]], as the two games in the series ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' (1997) and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' (2003), Square Enix announced that all future games set in the game world would be part of the new ''Ivalice Alliance'' subseries. These games to date include ''[[Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings]]'' (2007), ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions]]'' (2007), ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift]]'' (2007), and ''[[Final Fantasy XII#Versions and merchandise|Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"RPGFFFTgames\"/>\n\nThe music of these games has been primarily composed by [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]], who also composed the main-series game set in Ivalice, ''Final Fantasy XII''. [[Masaharu Iwata]] shared compositional duties with him for ''Tactics''; Sakimoto composed 47&nbsp;tracks for the game while Iwata composed the other 24.<ref name=\"RPGFFFT\"/> Sakimoto composed almost all of the music for ''Tactics Advance'', while Uematsu contributed the main theme and Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso composed additional battle tracks.<ref name=\"RPGFFFTAreview\"/> Both games have a soundtrack album, while ''Tactics Advance'' inspired an arranged album. Sakimoto again was the composer for ''Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift'', though this time he was supported by composers from his studio [[Basiscape]], and it too sparked a soundtrack album release. He also scored ''Revenant Wings'', though it primarily consisted of arrangements of his previous work and has not been released as a separate album, and his work on ''Tactics'' was used as the score for the spinoff series ''[[Crystal Defenders]]''.<ref name=\"SEMOFFTACD\"/>\n\n====''Crystal Chronicles''====\n{{main|Music of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series}}\n[[File:Kumi Tanioka 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Kumi Tanioka was the main composer of the ''Crystal Chronicles'' series.]]\nAnother spin-off of the main series, the ''Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles'' series consists of ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles|Crystal Chronicles]]'' (2004), its sequel ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates|Ring of Fates]]'' (2007), and their spin-offs ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King|My Life as a King]]'' (2008), ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time|Echoes of Time]]'' (2009), ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord|My Life as a Darklord]]'' (2009), and the newest title ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers|The Crystal Bearers]]'' (2009).

The soundtrack has extensive use of many [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[musical instruments]]\u2014such as the [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], the [[crumhorn]] and the [[lute]]; creating a distinctively rustic feel\u2014and also follows the practices and styles of medieval music.<ref name=\"RPGFCCOST\"/> For the soundtrack to ''Ring of Fates'', Tanioka purposefully did not focus on \"world music\", instead focusing on \"creating a new landscape containing the same atmosphere\".<ref name=\"RPGFTANIOKAint\"/> ''Echoes of Time'' also incorporates a variety of instruments, including oboes, xylophones, marimbas, and Latin guitars.<ref name=\"EOT\"/>\n\nOf the released games, ''Crystal Chronicles'', ''Ring of Fates'', and ''Echoes of Time'' are the only ones to have a released soundtrack. ''Crystal Chronicles'' also has sparked a single of its theme song, {{nihongo|\"Sound of the Wind\"|\u30ab\u30bc\u30ce\u30cd|Kaze no Ne}}, composed by Kumi Tanioka and performed by [[Fujimoto Yae]].<ref name=\"RPGFFFCCsingle\"/> ''Ring of Fates'' also has an associated single of its theme song, {{nihongo|\"A World Without Stars\"|\u661f\u306e\u306a\u3044\u4e16\u754c|Hoshi no Nai Sekai}}, written and performed by [[Aiko (singer)|Aiko]].<ref name=\"RPGFFFCCRPFOP\"/> ''Echoes of Time'' did not have a theme song.<ref name=\"EOT\"/>\n\n====''Chocobo''====\n{{Main|Music of the Chocobo series}}\nThe [[Chocobo (series)|''Chocobo'' series]] is a spin-off series of games first developed by Square and later by Square Enix, featuring a [[super deformed]] version of the ''Final Fantasy'' series mascot\u2014the [[chocobo]]\u2014as the protagonist.

The sequel to ''Chocobo Tales'', ''Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes'', contains mainly original works, and the two games were scored by Yuzo Takahashi.

Many have also inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums as well. These albums have been produced and reprinted by a number of different companies, including [[DigiCube]], [[NTT Publishing]], Square Enix itself, and many others. Additionally, many albums have been made available at the [[iTunes Music Store]].<ref name=\"SEdownload\"/> In addition to the regular albums, a number of [[List of Final Fantasy compilation albums|compilation albums]] of pieces from several ''Final Fantasy'' games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups, both officially and unofficially.

The meaning behind the emblem, in the language of Vivekananda himself:\n''\"The wavy waters in the picture are symbolic of [[Karma]], the lotus of Bhakti, and the rising-sun of [[Jnana]]. The encircling serpent is indicative of [[Yoga]] and awakened Kunadalini Shakti, while the swan in the picture stands for Paramatman. Therefore, the ideal of the picture is that by the union of Karma, Jnana, Bhakti and Yoga, the vision of the Paramatman is obtained\"''\n\n==The Holy Trio==\n<gallery>\nFile:Swami_Vivekananda-1893-09-signed.jpg|[[Swami Vivekananda]]\nFile:Ramakrishna.jpg|[[Sri Ramakrishna]]\nFile:Holy mother sarada.jpg|[[Sarada Devi|Maa Sarada]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Sri Ramakrishna===\nSri Ramakrishna was born Gadadhar Chatterjee in 1836 at [[Kamarpukur]] about sixty miles from [[Calcutta]]. His parents, Khudiram and Chandramani, were poor and made ends meet with great difficulty. He disliked going to school and, when asked why he did not want to go to school, his reply was ''The so-called education is for earning money only ; I don't care for this kind of education''.\n\nHe loved Nature and spent his time in fields and fruit gardens outside the village with his friends. Gadadhar lost his father at the age of seven. He became more serious from then on, but he did not change his ways and habits. For instance, he would not go to school, Instead, he was seen visiting monks who stopped at his village on their way to [[Puri]]. He would serve them and listen with attention to the arguments they had among themselves over religious issues.\n\nGadadhar had now attained the age when he should be invested with the sacred thread. When arrangements were nearly complete for this, Gadadhar declared that he would have his first alms as a [[brahmin]] from a certain sudra woman of the village.\n\nWhen Gadadhar started worshipping the deity, he began to ask himself if he was worshipping a piece of stone or a living Goddess. If he was worshipping a living Goddess, why should she not respond to his worship? This question nagged him day and night. Then, he began to pray to Kali - \"Mother, you've been gracious to many devotees in the past and have revealed yourself to them. Why would you not reveal yourself to me, also? Am I not also your son?\"\n\nHe would weep bitterly and sometimes even cry out loudly while worshipping. At night, he would go into a nearby jungle and spend the whole night praying. One day he was so impatient to see Mother [[Kali]] that he decided to end his life. He seized a sword hanging on the wall and was about to strike himself with it when he saw light issuing from the deity in waves and he was soon overwhelmed by those waves. He then fell down unconscious on the floor.\n\nSoon word spread about this remarkable man and people of all denominations and all stations of life began to come to him. From now on he came to be known as [[Ramakrishna Paramahansa]], and like a magnet he began to attract real seekers of God. He died in 1886, leaving behind a devoted band of young disciples headed by the scholar and orator, [[Swami Vivekananda]].\n\n===Sri Sarada Devi===\nEndearingly known as \u2018Holy Mother\u2019, Sri Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Sri Ramakrishna, was born on 22 December 1853 in a poor Brahmin family in [[Jayrambati]], a village adjoining [[Kamarpukur]] in [[West Bengal]].  Her father was Ramachandra Mukhopadhyay and her mother was Shyama Sundari Devin.\n\nAs a child Sarada was devoted to God. She had no formal schooling, but learnt the [[Bengali alphabet]]. When she was about six years old, she was married to [[Sri Ramakrishna]], according to the custom prevalent in [[India]] in those days.\n\n[[Sri Ramakrishna]] looked upon Sarada Devi as a manifestation of the Divine Mother of the [[universe]]. Under the strain of constant physical work and self-denial and repeated attacks of [[malaria]], her health deteriorated in the closing years of her life, and she died on 21 July 1920.\n\n===Swami Vivekananda===\n[[Swami Vivekananda]], known in his pre-monastic life as [[Narendra Nath Datta]], was born in an affluent family in [[Kolkata]] on 12 January 1863.  His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney, his mother was Bhuvaneshwari Devi. Narendra excelled in music, gymnastics and studies.

The encircling serpent is indicative of [[Yoga]] and awakened Kunadalini Shakti, while the swan in the picture stands for Paramatman.

His parents, Khudiram and Chandramani, were poor and made ends meet with great difficulty. He disliked going to school and, when asked why he did not want to go to school, his reply was ''The so-called education is for earning money only ; I don't care for this kind of education''.\n\nHe loved Nature and spent his time in fields and fruit gardens outside the village with his friends. Gadadhar lost his father at the age of seven. He became more serious from then on, but he did not change his ways and habits. For instance, he would not go to school, Instead, he was seen visiting monks who stopped at his village on their way to [[Puri]]. He would serve them and listen with attention to the arguments they had among themselves over religious issues.\n\nGadadhar had now attained the age when he should be invested with the sacred thread. When arrangements were nearly complete for this, Gadadhar declared that he would have his first alms as a [[brahmin]] from a certain sudra woman of the village.\n\nWhen Gadadhar started worshipping the deity, he began to ask himself if he was worshipping a piece of stone or a living Goddess. If he was worshipping a living Goddess, why should she not respond to his worship? This question nagged him day and night. Then, he began to pray to Kali - \"Mother, you've been gracious to many devotees in the past and have revealed yourself to them. Why would you not reveal yourself to me, also? Am I not also your son?\"\n\nHe would weep bitterly and sometimes even cry out loudly while worshipping. At night, he would go into a nearby jungle and spend the whole night praying. One day he was so impatient to see Mother [[Kali]] that he decided to end his life. He seized a sword hanging on the wall and was about to strike himself with it when he saw light issuing from the deity in waves and he was soon overwhelmed by those waves. He then fell down unconscious on the floor.\n\nSoon word spread about this remarkable man and people of all denominations and all stations of life began to come to him. From now on he came to be known as [[Ramakrishna Paramahansa]], and like a magnet he began to attract real seekers of God. He died in 1886, leaving behind a devoted band of young disciples headed by the scholar and orator, [[Swami Vivekananda]].\n\n===Sri Sarada Devi===\nEndearingly known as \u2018Holy Mother\u2019, Sri Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Sri Ramakrishna, was born on 22 December 1853 in a poor Brahmin family in [[Jayrambati]], a village adjoining [[Kamarpukur]] in [[West Bengal]].  Her father was Ramachandra Mukhopadhyay and her mother was Shyama Sundari Devin.\n\nAs a child Sarada was devoted to God. She had no formal schooling, but learnt the [[Bengali alphabet]]. When she was about six years old, she was married to [[Sri Ramakrishna]], according to the custom prevalent in [[India]] in those days.\n\n[[Sri Ramakrishna]] looked upon Sarada Devi as a manifestation of the Divine Mother of the [[universe]]. Under the strain of constant physical work and self-denial and repeated attacks of [[malaria]], her health deteriorated in the closing years of her life, and she died on 21 July 1920.\n\n===Swami Vivekananda===\n[[Swami Vivekananda]], known in his pre-monastic life as [[Narendra Nath Datta]], was born in an affluent family in [[Kolkata]] on 12 January 1863.

In a historical sense, it refers primarily to the governments of [[Ramsay MacDonald]], [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] which held office from 1931 until 1940.\n\nThe all-party coalitions of [[H. H. Asquith]] and [[David Lloyd George]] in the [[First World War]] and of [[Winston Churchill]] in the [[Second World War]] were sometimes referred to as National Governments at the time, but are now more commonly called Coalition Governments.  The term \"National Government\" was chosen to dissociate itself from negative connotations of the earlier Coalitions.<ref>{{cite web|date=25 August 1931|title=MacDonald forms a coalition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/25/archive-1931-macdonald-forms-coalition|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=[[John Buchan|Buchan]]|first1=John|title=The Gap in the Curtain|url=https://archive.org/details/gapincurtain0000buch|url-access=registration|date=1932|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/gapincurtain0000buch/page/162 162]|quote=\"A Coalition...only shares the loot, but a national government pools the brains.\"}}</ref>  Churchill's brief 1945 [[Churchill caretaker ministry|Caretaker Government]] also called itself a National Government and in terms of party composition was very similar to the 1931\u20131940 ones.\n\n==Crisis of 1931==\n{{Main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:(James) Ramsay MacDonald by Solomon Joseph Solomon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]] was Prime Minister for the first four years of National Government]]\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash]] heralded the global [[Great Depression]] and Britain was hit, although not as badly as most countries. The government was trying to achieve several different, contradictory objectives: trying to maintain Britain's economic position by maintaining the [[Pound (sterling)|pound]] on the [[gold standard]], balancing the [[United Kingdom budget|budget]], and providing assistance and relief to tackle unemployment. The gold standard meant that British prices were higher than its competitors, so the all-important export industries did poorly.\n\nIn 1931, the situation deteriorated and there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was borne out by the independent [[May Report]] which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The [[History of the British Labour Party#Second Labour government (1929\u20131931)|Labour government]] agreed in principle to make changes in taxation and to cut expenditure to balance the budget and restore confidence. However, the Cabinet could not agree on the two options available: either introduce tariffs (taxes on imports) or make 20% cuts in [[unemployment benefit]]. In the end, MacDonald and Snowden drafted a proposal that would cut benefits by 10%. Trade unions rejected this proposal. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11\u20139 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[George Lansbury]], threatening to resign rather than agree. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign.<ref>Neil Riddell, ''Labour in Crisis: The Second Labour Government 1929-1931'' (Manchester UP, 1999).</ref><ref>Chris Wrigley, \"The Fall of the Second MacDonald Government, 1931.\" in T.  Heppell and K. Theakston,  ''How Labour Governments Fall'' (Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2013) pp. 38-60.</ref>\n\nThe financial crisis grew worse and decisive government action was needed as the leaders of both the Conservative and Liberal Parties met with [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and MacDonald, at first to discuss support for the measures to be taken but later to discuss the shape of the next government. MacDonald had originally wished to tender his resignation but was told to re-consider by the King on the grounds that the majority of opposition MPs and the country at large supported the cuts proposed by the [[May Report]], even if the  Labour Party and the Trade Unions led by [[Ernest Bevin]] did not. MacDonald duly changed his mind during the night and met with the Conservative and Liberal MPs the following morning. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed and formed a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called \"[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour Party]]\") who stood  with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin and Chamberlain) and two Liberals. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition.\n\n==Early days==\n{{main|National Government (1931)}}\nThe Government was initially applauded by most, but the Labour Party were left in a state of confusion with the loss of several of their most prominent figures, and MacDonald, [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]] and [[James Henry Thomas]] did little to explain themselves, with the result that the Labour Party soon swung fully against the government. This was in part because of the Trade Unions' decision to oppose all forms of cuts proposed by MacDonald and Snowden in response to the [[May Report]], which had concluded the UK government needed to curb government expenditure to reduce the budget deficit amid the fallout from the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929. The May Report in particular recommended to MacDonald that his Labour government cut unemployment benefit by 20%. The Trade Unions that represented a large proportion of the Labour party's base refused to support any cuts to benefits or wages except to \"the salaries of Ministers\". Efforts to bring public expenditure cuts produced further problems, including a mutiny in the [[Royal Navy]] over pay cuts (the [[Invergordon Mutiny]]), with the result that the [[pound sterling]] came under renewed pressure, and the government was forced to take the radical step of taking the pound off the [[gold standard]] altogether.<ref>[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars: 1918-1945'' (1955) pp 413\u201379</ref>\n\nDebate then broke out about further steps to tackle the economic problems. At the same time the Labour Party officially expelled all of its members who supported the National Government, including MacDonald. Increasingly, the majority of the Cabinet came to believe that a protective tariff was necessary to support British industry and provide revenue and that a general election should be fought to secure a mandate but this was anathema to the Liberal Party. The Liberals' acting leader and [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]], fought in Cabinet against an election but found the Liberal Party dividing in several directions over the course of action. One group, under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] emerged as the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]], was prepared to accept the tariff and expressed willingness to take the place of the main Liberals in the government. The party's official leader, [[David Lloyd George]] was incapacitated at this time but called for the Liberals to abandon the government altogether and stand independently in defence of [[free trade]], but his call was heeded only by four other MPs, all of whom were his close relatives.\n\nIt was eventually agreed that the government as a whole would seek a \"Doctor's Mandate\" to take a free hand and that each party would issue its own manifesto. Supporters of MacDonald formed the [[National Labour Organisation]] and the parties agreed to allow their local organisations to agree whether or not to oppose each other. The government was opposed by the Labour Party, Lloyd George and his Liberals and the [[New Party (Oswald Mosley)|New Party]] of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]. Within the parties there was particular conflict between the Conservatives and Liberals. The 1931 general election campaign run by the National Government figures stressed their policies would aim to avoid any risk of Britain seeing such events as those of Germany two years ago including [[hyperinflation]] and MacDonald famously waved worthless Deutschmarks to emphasise the point. The result of the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] was the greatest landslide in British political history, the National Government winning a total of 556 seats and a Parliamentary majority of 500.<ref>Andrew Thorpe, \"The British General Election of 1931\" (Oxford UP, 1991) [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198202189.001.0001/acprof-9780198202189 online]</ref>  It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52.  MacDonald was unified with the Conservaties and National Liberal leaders on one platform (he returning 13 of his 20 National Labour candidates).<ref>Andrew Thorpe, \"Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931.\" ''Historical Journal'' 31#1 (1988): 117-139.

He became Prime Minister when MacDonald retired.]] As few Labour MPs refused to abandon the wishes of the Trade Unionists led by [[Ernest Bevin]], the support for the re-elected National Government was heavily Conservative.\n\n==1931\u20131935==\n{{Main|National Government (1931\u20131935)}}\nAlthough the Conservatives had a bare majority in Cabinet of 11, compared to 9 non-Conservatives, the former held comparatively few of the most important jobs. The two groups of Liberals were similarly unbalanced in terms of posts, the official Liberals holding one more seat than the National Liberals, despite the parliamentary position being reversed. That balance was to cause tensions, particularly as the [[Diehard Conservatism|Diehard]] wing of the Conservative party felt unrepresented.<ref>Stuart Ball,  \"The Conservative Party and the Formation of the National Government: August 1931.\" ''Historical Journal'' 29#1 (1986): 159-182.</ref>\n\nThe government entered protracted wrangling over whether or not to introduce tariffs. Both the Liberals and Snowden found it particularly difficult to accept but were in a heavy minority. However, both MacDonald and Baldwin wished to maintain the multiparty nature of the Government. On the suggestion of Hailsham, it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs while remaining in government. This held for some months.<ref>David Marquand, ''Ramsay MacDonald'' (1977).</ref>\n\nIn 1932, [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald MacLean]] died. MacDonald came under pressure not to merely appoint another Liberal, particularly as it was felt that they would be over-represented, and so instead appointed the Conservative [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]] (later Lord Halifax). Further tensions emerged over the [[Ottawa Agreement]], which set up a series of tariff agreements within the [[British Empire]], and the remaining Liberals and Snowden resigned their ministerial posts although they continued to support the government from the backbenches for another year. MacDonald considered resigning as well to allow a party government to take office but was persuaded to remain even though his health was now in decline. In domestic politics, he increasingly allowed Baldwin to give a lead, but in foreign affairs, the main direction was determined by MacDonald and Simon.\n\nThe most prominent policy of the National Government in the early 1930s was the proposal to introduce [[Indian Home Rule]], a measure fiercely opposed by the [[Diehard Conservatism|Diehard]] wing of the Conservative party, with [[Winston Churchill]] one of the most open opponents. The bill was fiercely opposed but eventually passed in 1947 in very different circumstances.\n\n==Baldwin takes over==\n{{main|National Government (1935\u20131937)}}\nWith MacDonald's health failing, he retired as Prime Minister in June 1935, to be succeeded by Baldwin.<ref>Keith Middlemas and A.J.L. Barnes, ''Baldwin: a biography'' (1969).</ref>\n\nIncreasingly foreign affairs were coming to dominate political discourse and in November Baldwin led the government to victory in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] on a platform of support for the [[League of Nations]] and sanctions against Italy for invading [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. The following month a massive storm developed when it emerged that the new Foreign Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], had negotiated the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] which proposed to cede most of Abyssinia to Italy. Many were outraged, including many government MPs, and the agreement was dropped and Hoare sacked, though he later returned to government.<ref>Paul W. Doerr, ''British foreign policy, 1919-1939'' (Manchester UP, 1998).</ref>  The government sponsored a series of conferences to enable more home rule in India and other colonies.<ref>Spencer Mawby, \"The Transformation and Decline of the British Empire: Decolonisation After the First World War\" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015).</ref>\n\nBaldwin's last years in office were seen as a period of drift, but in late 1936 he achieved a notable triumph in resolving the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]] without major repercussions. Baldwin took the opportunity of [[George VI]]'s coronation as an opportune moment to retire.<ref>James C. Ching, \"Stanley Baldwin's speech on the abdication of Edward VIII.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 42.2 (1956): 163-169.</ref>\n\n==Peacetime government of Neville Chamberlain==\n{{main|National Government (1937\u20131939)}}\n[[File:Neville Chamberlain by William Orpen - 1929.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Neville Chamberlain]] had succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister in 1937]]\n\n[[Neville Chamberlain]] was seen by many as the only possible successor to Baldwin, and his appointment as Prime Minister was widely credited with bringing a new dynamism to the government. With a strong track record as a radical [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and competent [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] many expected Chamberlain to provide a strong lead in domestic affairs and here the government had a number of successes, such as over the nationalisation of coal mining royalties, the curtailing of excess working hours by the Factory Act and much [[slum clearance]]. Another success was the [[1938 Holidays with Pay Act]], which gave a fortnight's paid holiday a year to workers, starting in 1939. The school leaving age was also to be increased from Autumn 1939, but was deferred as war loomed. Further reforms were curtailed by the increased international tension which came to occupy most of his time.<ref>Robert C. Self, ''Neville Chamberlain: a biography'' (Ashgate, 2006) pp 261-90.</ref>\n\nIn foreign affairs, the government sought to increase Britain's armaments, while maintaining the unity of the Empire and [[Dominion]]s and preventing any one power from becoming dominant on the continent of Europe. These proved increasingly difficult to reconcile, as many Dominions were reluctant to support Britain in the event of her going to war, and so military action risked splitting the Empire. Chamberlain took a strong personal lead in foreign affairs and sought to bring about peaceful revision of European frontiers in areas where many commentators had long-acknowledged grievances. In this, he received much popular support at the time, but the policy has been much attacked since. The most prominent point in the policy of [[appeasement]] came in September 1938, when the [[Munich Agreement]] was negotiated. Following the agreement, the government sped up the re-armament process in the hope of being ready for war when it came. At the same time, it took a tougher line in foreign affairs, including making a guarantee to defend [[Poland]] against Germany.<ref>Maurice Cowling, ''The Impact of Hitler: British Politics and British Policy, 1933-1940'' (Cambridge UP, 1975).</ref>\n\n==Outbreak of war==\n{{Main|Chamberlain war ministry|Churchill war ministry}}\nWhen Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Britain declared war in tandem with France, supported by all of the Dominions except [[Irish Free State|Ireland]]. For some time there had been calls to expand Chamberlain's war ministry by bringing in members of the official Labour and Liberal parties but the latter refused to join. For the first few months of war Britain saw comparatively little action apart from at sea, but the failure of the [[Norwegian campaign]] led to a massive outcry in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill cph.3b13157.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill]] succeeded Chamberlain in 1940. He served as Prime Minister for [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|most of the Second World War]].]]\nOn 7 and 8 May 1940, a two-day debate took place in Parliament, known to history as the [[Norway Debate]]. Initially a discussion of what had gone wrong in that field, it soon turned into a general debate on the conduct of the war with fierce criticism expressed by all sides of the House. The government won the debate, albeit with a reduced majority, but over the next two days it became increasingly clear that Labour and the Liberals would have to be brought into government and that Chamberlain was unable to achieve this. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the [[Low Countries]] and Chamberlain finally bowed to pressure and resigned, bringing the life of the National Government to a close. It was succeeded by an all-party coalition headed by [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>Malcolm Smith, ''Britain and 1940: history, myth and popular memory'' (Routledge, 2014).</ref>\n\n==Caretaker government of 1945==\n{{Main|Churchill caretaker ministry}}\nIn May 1945, following the defeat of Germany the coalition government broke up and Churchill formed a new administration, including Conservatives, Liberal Nationals and various non-party individuals who had been previously appointed to Ministerial posts. However, significantly, with the exception of the [[Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]], there were no other Liberal Nationals in the Cabinet, excluding even the Lord Chancellor Lord Simon. This government nevertheless used the title '''National Government''' and could be seen as the heir to the 1930s governments, even though the personnel were very different. The government fought the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] as a National Government but lost.\n\nFollowing the defeat, elements of the old National Government 'all party coalition' idea continued with [[Sir John Anderson]] (elected as a National MP) and [[Gwilym Lloyd-George]], a former Liberal MP who now sat as an Independent Liberal, occupying important positions in Churchill's [[Shadow Cabinet]] team. In addition the Liberal Nationals ([[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] from 1947\u201348 onwards) also kept a semi-separate existence and did not finally disappear until 1968, the last political legacy of what happened in the crisis of August 1931.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bassett, Reginald.

MacDonald duly changed his mind during the night and met with the Conservative and Liberal MPs the following morning. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed and formed a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called \"[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour Party]]\") who stood  with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin and Chamberlain) and two Liberals. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[1931 United Kingdom general election|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition.\n\n==Early days==\n{{main|National Government (1931)}}\nThe Government was initially applauded by most, but the Labour Party were left in a state of confusion with the loss of several of their most prominent figures, and MacDonald, [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]] and [[James Henry Thomas]] did little to explain themselves, with the result that the Labour Party soon swung fully against the government. This was in part because of the Trade Unions' decision to oppose all forms of cuts proposed by MacDonald and Snowden in response to the [[May Report]], which had concluded the UK government needed to curb government expenditure to reduce the budget deficit amid the fallout from the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929. The May Report in particular recommended to MacDonald that his Labour government cut unemployment benefit by 20%. The Trade Unions that represented a large proportion of the Labour party's base refused to support any cuts to benefits or wages except to \"the salaries of Ministers\". Efforts to bring public expenditure cuts produced further problems, including a mutiny in the [[Royal Navy]] over pay cuts (the [[Invergordon Mutiny]]), with the result that the [[pound sterling]] came under renewed pressure, and the government was forced to take the radical step of taking the pound off the [[gold standard]] altogether.<ref>[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars: 1918-1945'' (1955) pp 413\u201379</ref>\n\nDebate then broke out about further steps to tackle the economic problems. At the same time the Labour Party officially expelled all of its members who supported the National Government, including MacDonald. Increasingly, the majority of the Cabinet came to believe that a protective tariff was necessary to support British industry and provide revenue and that a general election should be fought to secure a mandate but this was anathema to the Liberal Party. The Liberals' acting leader and [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]], fought in Cabinet against an election but found the Liberal Party dividing in several directions over the course of action. One group, under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] emerged as the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]], was prepared to accept the tariff and expressed willingness to take the place of the main Liberals in the government. The party's official leader, [[David Lloyd George]] was incapacitated at this time but called for the Liberals to abandon the government altogether and stand independently in defence of [[free trade]], but his call was heeded only by four other MPs, all of whom were his close relatives.\n\nIt was eventually agreed that the government as a whole would seek a \"Doctor's Mandate\" to take a free hand and that each party would issue its own manifesto. Supporters of MacDonald formed the [[National Labour Organisation]] and the parties agreed to allow their local organisations to agree whether or not to oppose each other. The government was opposed by the Labour Party, Lloyd George and his Liberals and the [[New Party (Oswald Mosley)|New Party]] of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]. Within the parties there was particular conflict between the Conservatives and Liberals. The 1931 general election campaign run by the National Government figures stressed their policies would aim to avoid any risk of Britain seeing such events as those of Germany two years ago including [[hyperinflation]] and MacDonald famously waved worthless Deutschmarks to emphasise the point. The result of the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] was the greatest landslide in British political history, the National Government winning a total of 556 seats and a Parliamentary majority of 500.<ref>Andrew Thorpe, \"The British General Election of 1931\" (Oxford UP, 1991) [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198202189.001.0001/acprof-9780198202189 online]</ref>  It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52.  MacDonald was unified with the Conservaties and National Liberal leaders on one platform (he returning 13 of his 20 National Labour candidates).<ref>Andrew Thorpe, \"Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931.\" ''Historical Journal'' 31#1 (1988): 117-139. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639239 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Nick Smart, ''The National Government, 1931\u201340'' (Macmillan Education UK, 1999) pp. 9-36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stanley Baldwin LCCN2014715475.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stanley Baldwin]] was a dominant figure from the outset of National Government. He became Prime Minister when MacDonald retired.]] As few Labour MPs refused to abandon the wishes of the Trade Unionists led by [[Ernest Bevin]], the support for the re-elected National Government was heavily Conservative.\n\n==1931\u20131935==\n{{Main|National Government (1931\u20131935)}}\nAlthough the Conservatives had a bare majority in Cabinet of 11, compared to 9 non-Conservatives, the former held comparatively few of the most important jobs. The two groups of Liberals were similarly unbalanced in terms of posts, the official Liberals holding one more seat than the National Liberals, despite the parliamentary position being reversed. That balance was to cause tensions, particularly as the [[Diehard Conservatism|Diehard]] wing of the Conservative party felt unrepresented.<ref>Stuart Ball,  \"The Conservative Party and the Formation of the National Government: August 1931.\" ''Historical Journal'' 29#1 (1986): 159-182.</ref>\n\nThe government entered protracted wrangling over whether or not to introduce tariffs. Both the Liberals and Snowden found it particularly difficult to accept but were in a heavy minority. However, both MacDonald and Baldwin wished to maintain the multiparty nature of the Government. On the suggestion of Hailsham, it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs while remaining in government. This held for some months.<ref>David Marquand, ''Ramsay MacDonald'' (1977).</ref>\n\nIn 1932, [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald MacLean]] died. MacDonald came under pressure not to merely appoint another Liberal, particularly as it was felt that they would be over-represented, and so instead appointed the Conservative [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]] (later Lord Halifax). Further tensions emerged over the [[Ottawa Agreement]], which set up a series of tariff agreements within the [[British Empire]], and the remaining Liberals and Snowden resigned their ministerial posts although they continued to support the government from the backbenches for another year. MacDonald considered resigning as well to allow a party government to take office but was persuaded to remain even though his health was now in decline. In domestic politics, he increasingly allowed Baldwin to give a lead, but in foreign affairs, the main direction was determined by MacDonald and Simon.\n\nThe most prominent policy of the National Government in the early 1930s was the proposal to introduce [[Indian Home Rule]], a measure fiercely opposed by the [[Diehard Conservatism|Diehard]] wing of the Conservative party, with [[Winston Churchill]] one of the most open opponents. The bill was fiercely opposed but eventually passed in 1947 in very different circumstances.\n\n==Baldwin takes over==\n{{main|National Government (1935\u20131937)}}\nWith MacDonald's health failing, he retired as Prime Minister in June 1935, to be succeeded by Baldwin.<ref>Keith Middlemas and A.J.L. Barnes, ''Baldwin: a biography'' (1969).</ref>\n\nIncreasingly foreign affairs were coming to dominate political discourse and in November Baldwin led the government to victory in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] on a platform of support for the [[League of Nations]] and sanctions against Italy for invading [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. The following month a massive storm developed when it emerged that the new Foreign Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], had negotiated the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] which proposed to cede most of Abyssinia to Italy. Many were outraged, including many government MPs, and the agreement was dropped and Hoare sacked, though he later returned to government.<ref>Paul W. Doerr, ''British foreign policy, 1919-1939'' (Manchester UP, 1998).</ref>  The government sponsored a series of conferences to enable more home rule in India and other colonies.<ref>Spencer Mawby, \"The Transformation and Decline of the British Empire: Decolonisation After the First World War\" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015).</ref>\n\nBaldwin's last years in office were seen as a period of drift, but in late 1936 he achieved a notable triumph in resolving the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]] without major repercussions. Baldwin took the opportunity of [[George VI]]'s coronation as an opportune moment to retire.<ref>James C. Ching, \"Stanley Baldwin's speech on the abdication of Edward VIII.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 42.2 (1956): 163-169.</ref>\n\n==Peacetime government of Neville Chamberlain==\n{{main|National Government (1937\u20131939)}}\n[[File:Neville Chamberlain by William Orpen - 1929.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Neville Chamberlain]] had succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister in 1937]]\n\n[[Neville Chamberlain]] was seen by many as the only possible successor to Baldwin, and his appointment as Prime Minister was widely credited with bringing a new dynamism to the government. With a strong track record as a radical [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and competent [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] many expected Chamberlain to provide a strong lead in domestic affairs and here the government had a number of successes, such as over the nationalisation of coal mining royalties, the curtailing of excess working hours by the Factory Act and much [[slum clearance]]. Another success was the [[1938 Holidays with Pay Act]], which gave a fortnight's paid holiday a year to workers, starting in 1939. The school leaving age was also to be increased from Autumn 1939, but was deferred as war loomed. Further reforms were curtailed by the increased international tension which came to occupy most of his time.<ref>Robert C. Self, ''Neville Chamberlain: a biography'' (Ashgate, 2006) pp 261-90.</ref>\n\nIn foreign affairs, the government sought to increase Britain's armaments, while maintaining the unity of the Empire and [[Dominion]]s and preventing any one power from becoming dominant on the continent of Europe. These proved increasingly difficult to reconcile, as many Dominions were reluctant to support Britain in the event of her going to war, and so military action risked splitting the Empire. Chamberlain took a strong personal lead in foreign affairs and sought to bring about peaceful revision of European frontiers in areas where many commentators had long-acknowledged grievances. In this, he received much popular support at the time, but the policy has been much attacked since. The most prominent point in the policy of [[appeasement]] came in September 1938, when the [[Munich Agreement]] was negotiated. Following the agreement, the government sped up the re-armament process in the hope of being ready for war when it came. At the same time, it took a tougher line in foreign affairs, including making a guarantee to defend [[Poland]] against Germany.<ref>Maurice Cowling, ''The Impact of Hitler: British Politics and British Policy, 1933-1940'' (Cambridge UP, 1975).</ref>\n\n==Outbreak of war==\n{{Main|Chamberlain war ministry|Churchill war ministry}}\nWhen Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Britain declared war in tandem with France, supported by all of the Dominions except [[Irish Free State|Ireland]]. For some time there had been calls to expand Chamberlain's war ministry by bringing in members of the official Labour and Liberal parties but the latter refused to join. For the first few months of war Britain saw comparatively little action apart from at sea, but the failure of the [[Norwegian campaign]] led to a massive outcry in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill cph.3b13157.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill]] succeeded Chamberlain in 1940. He served as Prime Minister for [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|most of the Second World War]].]]\nOn 7 and 8 May 1940, a two-day debate took place in Parliament, known to history as the [[Norway Debate]]. Initially a discussion of what had gone wrong in that field, it soon turned into a general debate on the conduct of the war with fierce criticism expressed by all sides of the House. The government won the debate, albeit with a reduced majority, but over the next two days it became increasingly clear that Labour and the Liberals would have to be brought into government and that Chamberlain was unable to achieve this. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the [[Low Countries]] and Chamberlain finally bowed to pressure and resigned, bringing the life of the National Government to a close. It was succeeded by an all-party coalition headed by [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>Malcolm Smith, ''Britain and 1940: history, myth and popular memory'' (Routledge, 2014).</ref>\n\n==Caretaker government of 1945==\n{{Main|Churchill caretaker ministry}}\nIn May 1945, following the defeat of Germany the coalition government broke up and Churchill formed a new administration, including Conservatives, Liberal Nationals and various non-party individuals who had been previously appointed to Ministerial posts. However, significantly, with the exception of the [[Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]], there were no other Liberal Nationals in the Cabinet, excluding even the Lord Chancellor Lord Simon. This government nevertheless used the title '''National Government''' and could be seen as the heir to the 1930s governments, even though the personnel were very different. The government fought the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] as a National Government but lost.\n\nFollowing the defeat, elements of the old National Government 'all party coalition' idea continued with [[Sir John Anderson]] (elected as a National MP) and [[Gwilym Lloyd-George]], a former Liberal MP who now sat as an Independent Liberal, occupying important positions in Churchill's [[Shadow Cabinet]] team. In addition the Liberal Nationals ([[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] from 1947\u201348 onwards) also kept a semi-separate existence and did not finally disappear until 1968, the last political legacy of what happened in the crisis of August 1931.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bassett, Reginald.

After the war the economy began to improve, before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] the Croatian economy grew at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.\n\nThe Croatian economy is one of the strongest economies in [[Southeast Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hr-eu.net/article.php?lang=2&id=31&t=Economic%20transition|title=Economic transition|website=www.hr-eu.net|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Croatia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2000, [[NATO]] in 2009 and became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013.

Croatian economy reached pre-crisis levels in 2019 but due to [[Coronavirus_disease_2019|Coronavirus disease]] the economy is set to contract more than -6,2% during first and second quarter, however growth is set to pick up in thrid quarter of 2020.<ref>https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/croatia/overview#3</ref>\n\nThe [[Industry of Croatia|industrial sector]] with exports of over \u20ac10 billion annually is dominated by shipbuilding which accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry also account for significant portions of industrial output and exports. Industrial sector represents 27% of Croatia's total economic output while agriculture represents 6%. Industrial sector is responsible for 25% of Croatia's GDP, with agriculture, forestry and fishing accounting for the remaining 5% of Croatian GDP.\n\n[[Tourism]] is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 14 million tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of \u20ac8 billion.

Many industrial branches developed in that time, like forestry and wood industry ([[stave (wood)|stave]] fabrication, the production of potash, lumber mills, shipbuilding). The most profitable one was stave fabrication, the boom of which started in the 1820s with the clearing of the oak forests around [[Karlovac]] and [[Sisak]] and again in the 1850s with the marshy oak masses along the Sava and Drava rivers. Shipbuilding in Croatia played a huge role in the 1850s [[Austrian Empire]], especially the longe-range sailing boats. Sisak and [[Vukovar]] were the centres of river-shipbuilding.<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/81678 Mariann Nagy \u2013 Croatia in the Economic Structure of the Habsburg Empire in the Light of the 1857 Census], p. 81-82</ref> [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]] was also mostly an agricultural land and it was known for its silk production.

According to estimates, roughly 400,000 Croats emigrated from Austria-Hungary between 1880 and 1914.

Most of its industry was based in Slovenia and Croatia, but further industrial development was modest and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards and food-processing plants. Economy was still traditionally based on agriculture and raising of livestock, with peasants accounting for more than half of Croatia's population.<ref name=Frucht /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-84_kkgMf2QC The ''First Yugoslavia: Search for a Viable Political System''], Hoover Press, 1983, p. 72</ref>\n\nIn 1941 the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), a [[World War II]] [[puppet state]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was established in parts of [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Axis-occupied Yugoslavia]].

Its currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|NDH kuna]]. The Croatian State Bank was the central bank, responsible for issuing currency. As the war progressed the government kept printing more money and its amount in circulation was rapidly increasing, resulting in high inflation rates.<ref>Jozo Toma\u0161evi\u0107: Rat i revolucija u Jugoslaviji 1941\u20131945, 2010, p. 785</ref>\n\nAfter the World War II, the new [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] resorted to a command economy on the Soviet model of rapid industrial development. By 1948 almost all domestic and foreign-owned capital had been nationalized. The industrialization plan relied on high taxation, fixed prices, [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|war reparations]], Soviet credits, and export of food and raw materials. Forced collectivization of agriculture was initiated in 1949. At that time 94% of agricultural land was privately owned, and by 1950 96% was under the control of the social sector. A rapid improvement of food production and the standard of living was expected, but due to bad results the program was abandoned three years later.<ref name=Frucht />\n\nThroughout the 1950s Croatia experienced rapid urbanization. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]]. [[SR Croatia]] was, after [[SR Slovenia]], the second most developed republic in Yugoslavia with a 25% higher GDP per capita than the Yugoslav average. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall [[standard of living]]. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly.

Privatization under the new government had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], infrastructure sustained massive damage in the period 1991\u201392, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry. [[Privatization in Croatia]] and transformation from a planned economy to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady, largely as a result of public mistrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. With the end of the war, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment.<ref name=IBP /><ref name=Benczes>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203</ref> The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace.

In 1991 the [[Croatian dinar]] was introduced as a transitional currency, but inflation continued to accelerate. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 decreased retail price inflation from a monthly rate of 38,7% to 1,4%, and by the end of the year Croatia experienced deflation. In 1994 Croatia introduced the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] as its currency.<ref name=Benczes />\n\nAs a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995\u20131997.<ref name=Benczes /> Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of commercial creditors, when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks. In 1997 around 60 percent of Croatia's external debt was inherited from former Yugoslavia.<ref name=Benczes2>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 205-206</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1998 value-added tax was introduced.

After the war the economy began to improve, before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] the Croatian economy grew at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.\n\nThe Croatian economy is one of the strongest economies in [[Southeast Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hr-eu.net/article.php?lang=2&id=31&t=Economic%20transition|title=Economic transition|website=www.hr-eu.net|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Croatia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2000, [[NATO]] in 2009 and became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013.

Croatian economy reached pre-crisis levels in 2019 but due to [[Coronavirus_disease_2019|Coronavirus disease]] the economy is set to contract more than -6,2% during first and second quarter, however growth is set to pick up in thrid quarter of 2020.<ref>https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/croatia/overview#3</ref>\n\nThe [[Industry of Croatia|industrial sector]] with exports of over \u20ac10 billion annually is dominated by shipbuilding which accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry also account for significant portions of industrial output and exports. Industrial sector represents 27% of Croatia's total economic output while agriculture represents 6%. Industrial sector is responsible for 25% of Croatia's GDP, with agriculture, forestry and fishing accounting for the remaining 5% of Croatian GDP.\n\n[[Tourism]] is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 14 million tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of \u20ac8 billion.

Many industrial branches developed in that time, like forestry and wood industry ([[stave (wood)|stave]] fabrication, the production of potash, lumber mills, shipbuilding). The most profitable one was stave fabrication, the boom of which started in the 1820s with the clearing of the oak forests around [[Karlovac]] and [[Sisak]] and again in the 1850s with the marshy oak masses along the Sava and Drava rivers. Shipbuilding in Croatia played a huge role in the 1850s [[Austrian Empire]], especially the longe-range sailing boats.

Most of its industry was based in Slovenia and Croatia, but further industrial development was modest and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards and food-processing plants.

Its currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|NDH kuna]]. The Croatian State Bank was the central bank, responsible for issuing currency. As the war progressed the government kept printing more money and its amount in circulation was rapidly increasing, resulting in high inflation rates.<ref>Jozo Toma\u0161evi\u0107: Rat i revolucija u Jugoslaviji 1941\u20131945, 2010, p. 785</ref>\n\nAfter the World War II, the new [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] resorted to a command economy on the Soviet model of rapid industrial development. By 1948 almost all domestic and foreign-owned capital had been nationalized. The industrialization plan relied on high taxation, fixed prices, [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|war reparations]], Soviet credits, and export of food and raw materials. Forced collectivization of agriculture was initiated in 1949. At that time 94% of agricultural land was privately owned, and by 1950 96% was under the control of the social sector. A rapid improvement of food production and the standard of living was expected, but due to bad results the program was abandoned three years later.<ref name=Frucht />\n\nThroughout the 1950s Croatia experienced rapid urbanization. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]]. [[SR Croatia]] was, after [[SR Slovenia]], the second most developed republic in Yugoslavia with a 25% higher GDP per capita than the Yugoslav average. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall [[standard of living]]. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly.

Privatization under the new government had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], infrastructure sustained massive damage in the period 1991\u201392, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry. [[Privatization in Croatia]] and transformation from a planned economy to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady, largely as a result of public mistrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. With the end of the war, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment.<ref name=IBP /><ref name=Benczes>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203</ref> The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace.

In 1991 the [[Croatian dinar]] was introduced as a transitional currency, but inflation continued to accelerate. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 decreased retail price inflation from a monthly rate of 38,7% to 1,4%, and by the end of the year Croatia experienced deflation. In 1994 Croatia introduced the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] as its currency.<ref name=Benczes />\n\nAs a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995\u20131997.<ref name=Benczes /> Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of commercial creditors, when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks.
