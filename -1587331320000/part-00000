His compositions, of which around 500 are commonly known, are noted for their elaborate and poetic descriptions of Hindu gods and temples and for capturing the essence of the raga forms through the vainika (veena) style that emphasises gamakas. They are typically in a slower speed (chowka kala). He is also known by his signature name of '''Guruguha''' which is also his mudra (and can be found in each of his songs).<ref>http://www.guruguha.org/</ref> His compositions are widely sung and played in classical concerts of Carnatic music.\n\nMuthuswami Dikshitar composed many kritis in groups. The following lists describe those groups and compositions that belong to each group.\n\n== ''Maha Ganapati Krithis'' ==\n\nDeekshitar composed 26 songs in temples of Lord Ganesha in around

His compositions, of which around 500 are commonly known, are noted for their elaborate and poetic descriptions of Hindu gods and temples and for capturing the essence of the raga forms through the vainika (veena) style that emphasises gamakas. They are typically in a slower speed (chowka kala). He is also known by his signature name of '''Guruguha''' which is also his mudra (and can be found in each of his songs).<ref>http://www.guruguha.org/</ref> His compositions are widely sung and played in classical concerts of Carnatic music.\n\nMuthuswami Dikshitar composed many kritis in groups.

The gasworks was built in 1826 at a cost of \u00a34,000. In 1825, the corporation built eleven tiled, brick [[almshouse]]s for poor women.

They are commemorated by the town's [[cenotaph]]: which is located on the site of a bomb which was dropped by [[LZ 61 (Zeppelin 'L 21')|Zeppelin 'L 21']] \u2013 killing the town's mayoress, and two others. Damage from the Zeppelin can still be seen on what is now a club on the corner of the main road, just opposite a furniture shop. A plaque commemorates the incident. The town also has a memorial to two local [[Victoria Cross|VC]] recipients, [[John Henry Carless]]<ref name=timeline /> and [[Frederick J. Gibbs|Frederick Gibbs]].<ref>London-gazette.co.uk/issues/29899/supplements/472</ref>\n\n===20th-century developments===\n\nWalsall's first cinema opened in the town centre in 1908; however, the post [[World War II]] decline in cinema attendances brought on by the rise in television ownership resulted in that and all of Walsall's other cinemas eventually being closed. The first Wurlitzer theatre organ in Great Britain was installed in the New Picture House<ref>[http://www.beerwurlitzer.org.uk/walsall-picture-house.html Beer Wurlitzer website, A History of The Picture House, Walsall] retrieved 16 February 2018</ref> cinema in Lower Bridge Street in the town centre. It was later renamed the Gaumont then Odeon.\n\nSlum clearances began after the end of [[World War I]], with thousands of 19th-century buildings around the town centre being demolished as the 20th century wore on, with new estates being built away from the town centre during the 1920s and 1930s. These were concentrated in areas to the north of the town centre such as [[Coal Pool]], [[Blakenall Heath]] (where Walsall's first council houses were built in 1920), [[Goscote]] and [[Harden, West Midlands|Harden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36189 |title=Walsall \u2013 The growth of the town &#124; A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 17 (pp. 146\u2013165) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> after the end of [[World War II]], [[Beechdale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findanewhome.com/west-midlands/west.../walsall/guide.fap |title=New homes for sale in Walsall \u2013 new homes for sale \u2013 Zoopla |publisher=Findanewhome.com |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nSignificant developments also took place nearer to the town centre, particularly during the 1960s when a host of tower blocks were built around the town centre; however, most of these had been demolished by 2010.\n\nThe Memorial Gardens opened in 1952 in honour of the town's fallen combatants of the two [[world war]]s. The Old Square Shopping Centre, a modern indoor shopping complex featuring many big retail names, opened in 1969. The Old Square shopping centre is currently laying derelict, with shops set to open in the centre soon. [[Primark]] and [[The Co-operative Food|The Co-operative]] have opened in the former [[Tesco]] store, after the supermarket chained moved to Littleton Street by the college. A row of derelict shops were demolished in 2016, and rebuilt as a [[Poundland]], which opened on Saturday 15 July 2017, and [[B & M]], which opened on 17 August 2017. [[The Entertainer (Amersham) Ltd.]] also opened a store on 21 October 2017.\n\nThe County Borough of Walsall, which originally consisted of Walsall and Bloxwich, was expanded in 1966 to incorporate most of [[Darlaston]] and [[Willenhall]], as well as small parts of [[Bilston]] and [[Wednesbury]]. The current [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall]] was formed in 1974 when [[Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District]] was incorporated into Walsall. At the same time, Walsall was transferred from the historic county of [[Staffordshire]] to become part of the new [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] county.\n\nThe [[Saddlers Centre]], a modern shopping mall, opened in 1980, being refurbished within a decade. On 23 November 1981, [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] touched down in [[Bloxwich]] and later moved over parts of Walsall town centre and surrounding suburbs, causing some damage.<ref>{{cite web|author=European Severe Storms Laboratory |url=http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi |title=European Severe Weather Database |publisher=Eswd.eu |date=2019-11-19 |accessdate=2019-11-26}}</ref> The [[Jerome K.

In 1974, Walsall was transferred from the [[Historic counties of England|county]] of [[Staffordshire]] to form the metropolitan county of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]].\n\nThe [[Saddlers Centre|Saddlers' Centre]], a modern shopping complex, was opened in the [[town centre]] in 1980.

It was refurbished in 1973 and became the Cannon Cinema after a takeover in 1986, but closed on 18 November 1993 after operating as a cinema for 55 years. It was demolished some 18 months later and the town's new [[Woolworths Group|Woolworth's]] store was built on its site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/34302 |title=Cannon Walsall in Walsall, GB |publisher=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> The store closed down at the end of 2008 when the retailer went into liquidation,<ref>{{cite news|title=Woolworths store to be reborn|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2009/07/27/woolworths-store-to-be-reborn/|newspaper=Express & Star|date=27 July 2009}}</ref> and the building was re-occupied by a new [[T J Hughes]] department store which opened on 9 October 2009.<ref>[http://www.housewareslive.net/news/news.asp?id=5950 TJ Hughes opens in Walsall's former Woolies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331184919/http://www.housewareslive.net/news/news.asp?id=5950 |date=31 March 2012 }}</ref> However, the building became vacant again on 14 August 2011 when financial difficulties led to T.J.

The accent is often incorrectly referred to as a [[Brummie]] accent by people from outside the West Midlands.\n\n== Economy ==\nWalsall has had many industries, from coal mining to metal working. In the late 19th century, the coal mines ran dry, and Walsall became internationally famous for its leather trade. Walsall still manufactures the [[Elizabeth II|Queen's]] handbags, saddles for the Royal family and leathergoods for the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]]. Walsall is the traditional home of the English [[saddle]] manufacturing industry, hence the nickname of [[Walsall Football Club]], ''\"[[the Saddlers]]\"''. Apart from leather goods, other industries in Walsall include iron and brass founding, [[limestone]] quarrying, small hardware, plastics, electronics, chemicals and aircraft parts.\n\nWalsall's location in [[Central England]] and the fact that the [[M6 motorway|M6]] runs through the [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall]] has increased its investment appeal. The main [[RAC plc|RAC]] control centre is located in Walsall close by J9 of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and there are now plans to redevelop derelict land in nearby [[Darlaston]] and turn it into a state-of-the-art regional centre. Between [[Bloxwich]] and Walsall there is a business corridor where [[TK Maxx]] has recently opened a regional depot. Currently established businesses include [[Homeserve plc]] and [[South Staffordshire Water]].\n\nThe three largest businesses by turnover in the borough are all involved with the storage and distribution of retail goods to an associated network of high street or cornershop stores. Poundland Ltd (owned by South African giant Steinhoff), A F Blakemore and Sons Ltd and One Stop Stores Ltd (part of Tesco plc) turn over more than \u00a34.5bn annually between them.\n\n== Education ==\n{{See also|List of schools in Walsall}}\nWalsall is home to the [[University of Wolverhampton]]'s Sports and Art Campus and School of Education, all part of the Walsall Campus in Gorway Road, which includes a student village. [[Walsall College]] provides [[further education]], and is based around three sites across Walsall. There are ten secular junior schools and two religious junior schools in the town of Walsall. Walsall also houses many secondary schools, including comprehensives, academies, private and grammar schools (Namely [[Queen Mary's Grammar School|Queen Mary's Grammar School for Boys]] and [[Queen Mary's High School|Queen Mary's High School For Girls]]).\n\nThe age of transfer to secondary school throughout the borough is 11 years, although the Aldridge-Brownhills area of the borough had a system of 5\u20139 first, 9\u201313 middle and 13\u201318 secondary schools until 1986, as the former urban district council of this area had adopted the three-tier system in 1972.\n\nSchools within the borough are administered by Walsall MBC.[http://cms.walsall.gov.uk/index/education/transition_of_education_services.htm SERCO].\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:St Matthews Church - geograph.org.uk - 688710.jpg|thumb|St Matthew's Church]]\n[[File:St Martins Church - geograph.org.uk - 682370.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church]]\n\n[[Christianity]] is the largest religion in the Walsall Borough, shown in the 2011 census as 59.0%. The second largest is [[Islam]] recorded at 8.2%.\n\nOf the churches in Walsall, [[St Matthew's Church, Walsall|St Matthew's Church]] lies to the north of the town centre near the [[ASDA]] supermarket, and can be seen when entering Walsall in any direction where it is the highest structure. In 1821, St Matthew's Church was demolished with exception of the tower and chancel and replaced at a cost of \u00a320,000<ref name=freeling126 /> to a design by [[Francis Goodwin (architect)|Francis Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite book| title=History of the Borough and Foreign of Walsall |author=Edward Lees Glew |year=1856 |publisher=J.R.

Most of these are in close proximity to each other, located in the adjoining areas of [[Caldmore]] and [[Palfrey, West Midlands|Palfrey]], just south of the town centre.\n\nIn the ward of [[Palfrey]], there is Walsall's most-attended mosque, Masjid-Al-Farouq,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masjidalfarouq.org.uk/|title=Welcome to Masjid-Al-Farouq, Walsall|website=masjidalfarouq.org.uk|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> alongside Aisha Mosque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aishamosque.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Aisha Mosque & Islamic Centre|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> Caldmore is home to four mosques: Masjid-e-Usman, Shah Jalal Masjid,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shahjalal.org/|title=Shahjalal Masjid and Madrasah in Walsall for Boys and Girls|website=www.shahjalal.org|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> Jalalia Masjid, and Ghausia Qasmia Mosque.

Over 90 bus routes operated by eleven bus operators serve Walsall. Services from St Paul's Bus Station leave Walsall in many directions; there are services south-east to [[Birmingham]]; west to [[Wolverhampton]], [[Willenhall]], north to Bloxwich, [[Cannock]] and [[Brownhills]]; and east to [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Aldridge]], with many to the latter. In addition, services link Staffordshire areas such as [[Burntwood]], [[Lichfield]] and [[Cannock]]. St Paul's is also home to the Walsall Information Centre.\n\nBradford Place mainly operates buses to the south and south-west, to [[West Bromwich]], [[Bilston]], [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Dudley]], [[Stourbridge]] and Merry Hill Centre. There are also numerous shorter bus routes leaving from both stations which give the town centre a link to housing estates including Alumwell, Beechdale, Chuckery, Park Hall and the Manor Hospital.\n\n[[Walsall railway station]] is situated on Station Street in the town centre and is also accessible from the Saddlers shopping centre. There are typically four trains per hour from the station to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] and one train per hour to [[Rugeley Trent Valley railway station|Rugeley]] with fewer trains in the evenings and on Sundays. There is also a suburban station at [[Bescot railway station|Bescot]].\n\nWalsall is extremely well connected within the UK road network as it is served by the [[M6 motorway|M6]] which connects the [[M1 motorway]] towards [[London]] and [[M74 motorway]] towards [[Glasgow]]. There are three nearby junctions which serve Walsall on the [[M6 motorway]]: J7, J9 and J10. The stretch between these junctions is one of the busiest in Europe. The town is also served by [[A34 road]] which connects [[Manchester]] and the [[M42 motorway]] towards [[London]], and is connected regionally by the [[A454 road|A454]] Black Country route.\n\nA tram service was erected in the town towards the end of the 19th century and ran until 2 October 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/millennium/1900/1925-1949/1933.html |title=Our Century 1925\u20131949 |publisher=Expressandstar.com |date=2 October 1933 |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Walsall Aerodrome]] operated from the 1930s until 1956.<ref name=\"BCB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/Helliwells-aircraft-component-factory-at-Walsall-airport.htm|title=Helliwells aircraft component factory at Walsall airport|date=25 November 2010|work=Black Country Bugle|accessdate=19 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928060551/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/Helliwells-aircraft-component-factory-at-Walsall-airport.htm|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"BCH-1\">{{cite web|url=http://blackcountryhistory.org/collections/getrecord/WAHER_MBL1341/|title=Airfield; S of Aldridge|work=Black Country History|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> The nearest airport to Walsall is [[Birmingham Airport]], which is located within 30 minutes drive.\n\nThe [[Midland Metro]] have currently got services that run from [[Wolverhampton St George's tram stop]] to [[Grand Central tram stop]] and soon the metro will run and operate a tram extension from north of the former [[Wednesbury Town railway station]] across Potter Lane to a stop near [[Brierley Hill]] which will see the metro line use the corridor from Wednesbury Town to Dudley before running street level and back onto the track at Canal Street before branching off to [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre|Merry Hill]] and a tram stop at Brierley Hill.\n\nThe corridor section from Walsall to Wednesbury Town has been preserved for freight traffic to use to [[Round Oak Steel Terminal]] in the near future. It is possible that the metro extension will look to run an extension to Walsall via [[Bescot]] but will utilize the line with either people carriers or [[tram-trains]].\n\nWalsall was also to be part of the former '5' Ws scheme which would have connected it to [[Wolverhampton]], [[Wednesfield]], [[Willenhall]] and [[Wednesbury]]. Walsall Council decided to pull Walsall and Willenhall out of the scheme in favour of reopening the line to Wolverhampton to passengers via Darlaston and Willenhall. A proposal for the new stations to be built is part of a wider investment strategy to improve local services.<ref>{{cite web | title = At last New Willenhall Railway Station plan backed after years of campaigning | url = https://www.expressandstar.com/news/transport/2018/03/07/railway-station-set-for-the-green-light/| publisher = Express & Star}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:White, Hart, Caldmore.jpg|thumb|''White Hart, Caldmore'' Oil painting by an unknown artist, [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] permanent collection, 1976.088.P]]\n\n=== Arboretum and illuminations ===\n[[Walsall Arboretum]] was officially opened on 4 May 1874 by the wealthy Hatherton family.

The large gallery space is host to temporary exhibitions.\n\n=== Museums ===\nWalsall has two museums, [[Walsall Museum]] and [[Walsall Leather Museum]]. Walsall Museum features local history objects primarily from the manufacturing trades and also has a space for temporary exhibitions, while the leather museum displays a mixture of leather goods and has recreations of leatherworkers workshops.\n\n=== Public art ===\n[[File:Statue of Sister Dora - geograph.org.uk - 682348.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sister Dora]]\nThe refurbished [[Sister Dora]] statue stands at the crossroads of Park Street and Bridge Street.

Some writers have, including the Walsall born John Petty (1919\u20131973) who set a number of his books in Walsall, most famously ''Five Fags a Day'' (1956). More recently the comic novelist [[Paul McDonald (writer)|Paul McDonald]] has used Walsall as a location for ''Surviving Sting'' (2001) and ''Kiss Me Softly, Amy Turtle'' (2004).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.madasafish.com/~d_hodgkinson/bh-people.htm |title=People \u2013 Brownhills near Walsall West Midlands |publisher=Members.madasafish.com |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/amyturtle.html |title=Laurahird.com |publisher=Laurahird.com |accessdate=18 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200048/http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/amyturtle.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== TV and radio ===\n[[Big Centre TV]], the local television channel covering Birmingham and the Black Country, is based in Walsall town centre, now known as Birmingham TV.\n\n=== Sport ===\nWalsall's football club, [[Walsall F.C.]], ''the Saddlers'', was founded in 1888 when [[Walsall Town F.C.]] and [[Walsall Swifts F.C.]] merged. They won their first game against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. The club currently play in [[Football League Two]].\n\nThere are also a number of non-league football clubs based within the borough. Most notably Rushall Olympic.\n\nWalsall has a cricket club, [[Walsall Cricket Club]] who won Birmingham League Premier Division in 2006.\n\nWalsall RUFC is Walsall's [[rugby union]] team which is currently competing in [[Midlands 1 West]].\n\nAldridge and Walsall Hockey Club currently plays in the West Midlands Premier League and is managed by Sir [[Mark Grundy]].\n\nWalsall was also once home to [[Formula 1]] constructor [[Ensign Racing]], in Walsall Wood from 1973 to 1980, before moving to [[Chasetown]].\n\nWalsall was home to a [[horse racing course]]. The grandstand was constructed in 1809 at a cost of \u00a31,300 on a piece of land donated by the [[Earl of Bradford]] on a lease of 99 years. Soon after completion, one of the lower compartments was converted into a [[billiards]] room, which contained a table donated by Lord Chichester Spencer of Fisherwick Park. Throughout the 19th century, races were held annually at the racecourse at [[Michaelmas]].<ref>{{cite book| title=History of the Borough and Foreign of Walsall |author=Edward Lees Glew |year=1856 |publisher=J.R.

The scheme proposed to use a large amount of public money to construct the hall. Shopkeepers feared that their businesses would be affected and demonstrations were held across the town against the proposals. The demonstrations forced the plans to be shelved.<ref name=Glew15 />\n\nWalsall town centre is fast becoming the most popular shopping destination in the Black Country. This is partly because of the ample supply of free or extremely cheap parking available within the town centre, including at two large supermarkets \u2014 Tesco and Asda \u2014 located on opposite sides of the town centre. Crown Wharf Retail Park is the most popular area of shopping, Housing Asda's first non-food store, [[Asda Living]], as well as popular shops and restaurants such as [[Outfit]], [[Smyths Toys]], [[Bank]], [[T.K.

Well-known retailers such as [[New Look (company)|New Look]], [[Marks & Spencer]], [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]], [[USC (clothing retailer)|USC]] and [[Primark]] are all located on this fully pedestrianized high street. There is one main shopping mall 'Bradford Mall' formerly known as the '[[Saddlers Centre]]' and two smaller malls located in the town centre. 'The Old Square' shopping mall houses [[Debenhams]] and other smaller retailers, while 'Quasar Centre', now known as 'Park Place Shopping Centre', houses [[Wilko's]] and the other smaller retailers. Other shopping destinations include Broadwalk Retail Park and Reedswood Retail Park.\n\nThe area around [[Walsall Art Gallery]] is under redevelopment. A new [[Premier Inn]] hotel has opened along with an 8 screen [[The Light Cinemas]] in addition to popular restaurants such as [[PizzaExpress]], [[TGI Fridays]] and [[Bella Italia]]. There is also a second cinema to be opened across the road opposite Tesco, which will also house popular restaurants.\n\n== Recent changes ==\nProjects due for completion in 2009 and 2010 include [[Walsall Manor Hospital]] redevelopment worth \u00a3174 million, the new Walsall College worth \u00a365 million, the Waterfront South development worth \u00a360 million and the St. Matthew's Quarter worth more than \u00a325 million.

The Old Square Shopping Centre, a modern indoor shopping complex featuring many big retail names, opened in 1969.

The accent is often incorrectly referred to as a [[Brummie]] accent by people from outside the West Midlands.\n\n== Economy ==\nWalsall has had many industries, from coal mining to metal working. In the late 19th century, the coal mines ran dry, and Walsall became internationally famous for its leather trade. Walsall still manufactures the [[Elizabeth II|Queen's]] handbags, saddles for the Royal family and leathergoods for the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]]. Walsall is the traditional home of the English [[saddle]] manufacturing industry, hence the nickname of [[Walsall Football Club]], ''\"[[the Saddlers]]\"''. Apart from leather goods, other industries in Walsall include iron and brass founding, [[limestone]] quarrying, small hardware, plastics, electronics, chemicals and aircraft parts.\n\nWalsall's location in [[Central England]] and the fact that the [[M6 motorway|M6]] runs through the [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall]] has increased its investment appeal. The main [[RAC plc|RAC]] control centre is located in Walsall close by J9 of the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and there are now plans to redevelop derelict land in nearby [[Darlaston]] and turn it into a state-of-the-art regional centre. Between [[Bloxwich]] and Walsall there is a business corridor where [[TK Maxx]] has recently opened a regional depot. Currently established businesses include [[Homeserve plc]] and [[South Staffordshire Water]].\n\nThe three largest businesses by turnover in the borough are all involved with the storage and distribution of retail goods to an associated network of high street or cornershop stores. Poundland Ltd (owned by South African giant Steinhoff), A F Blakemore and Sons Ltd and One Stop Stores Ltd (part of Tesco plc) turn over more than \u00a34.5bn annually between them.\n\n== Education ==\n{{See also|List of schools in Walsall}}\nWalsall is home to the [[University of Wolverhampton]]'s Sports and Art Campus and School of Education, all part of the Walsall Campus in Gorway Road, which includes a student village. [[Walsall College]] provides [[further education]], and is based around three sites across Walsall. There are ten secular junior schools and two religious junior schools in the town of Walsall. Walsall also houses many secondary schools, including comprehensives, academies, private and grammar schools (Namely [[Queen Mary's Grammar School|Queen Mary's Grammar School for Boys]] and [[Queen Mary's High School|Queen Mary's High School For Girls]]).\n\nThe age of transfer to secondary school throughout the borough is 11 years, although the Aldridge-Brownhills area of the borough had a system of 5\u20139 first, 9\u201313 middle and 13\u201318 secondary schools until 1986, as the former urban district council of this area had adopted the three-tier system in 1972.\n\nSchools within the borough are administered by Walsall MBC.[http://cms.walsall.gov.uk/index/education/transition_of_education_services.htm SERCO].\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:St Matthews Church - geograph.org.uk - 688710.jpg|thumb|St Matthew's Church]]\n[[File:St Martins Church - geograph.org.uk - 682370.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church]]\n\n[[Christianity]] is the largest religion in the Walsall Borough, shown in the 2011 census as 59.0%. The second largest is [[Islam]] recorded at 8.2%.\n\nOf the churches in Walsall, [[St Matthew's Church, Walsall|St Matthew's Church]] lies to the north of the town centre near the [[ASDA]] supermarket, and can be seen when entering Walsall in any direction where it is the highest structure. In 1821, St Matthew's Church was demolished with exception of the tower and chancel and replaced at a cost of \u00a320,000<ref name=freeling126 /> to a design by [[Francis Goodwin (architect)|Francis Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite book| title=History of the Borough and Foreign of Walsall |author=Edward Lees Glew |year=1856 |publisher=J.R.

Most of these are in close proximity to each other, located in the adjoining areas of [[Caldmore]] and [[Palfrey, West Midlands|Palfrey]], just south of the town centre.\n\nIn the ward of [[Palfrey]], there is Walsall's most-attended mosque, Masjid-Al-Farouq,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://masjidalfarouq.org.uk/|title=Welcome to Masjid-Al-Farouq, Walsall|website=masjidalfarouq.org.uk|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> alongside Aisha Mosque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aishamosque.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Aisha Mosque & Islamic Centre|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> Caldmore is home to four mosques: Masjid-e-Usman, Shah Jalal Masjid,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shahjalal.org/|title=Shahjalal Masjid and Madrasah in Walsall for Boys and Girls|website=www.shahjalal.org|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> Jalalia Masjid, and Ghausia Qasmia Mosque. In [[Chuckery]], in the southeast of Walsall, lies Anjuman-e-Gosia Mosque and Jamia Masjid Ghausia is located in the [[Birchills]] neighbourhood.\n\nThere is also a private Islamic school and [[Madrassah]] with 4 campuses across Walsall known as Abu Bakr Trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abubakrtrust.org/|title=Abu Bakr Trust}}</ref> Most mosques in Walsall also run their own evening Madrassahs.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[Walsall Bus Station]] is made up of two smaller bus stations, Bradford Place Bus Station and St Paul's Bus Station, one being larger than the other and providing more services. Over 90 bus routes operated by eleven bus operators serve Walsall. Services from St Paul's Bus Station leave Walsall in many directions; there are services south-east to [[Birmingham]]; west to [[Wolverhampton]], [[Willenhall]], north to Bloxwich, [[Cannock]] and [[Brownhills]]; and east to [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Aldridge]], with many to the latter. In addition, services link Staffordshire areas such as [[Burntwood]], [[Lichfield]] and [[Cannock]]. St Paul's is also home to the Walsall Information Centre.\n\nBradford Place mainly operates buses to the south and south-west, to [[West Bromwich]], [[Bilston]], [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]], [[Dudley]], [[Stourbridge]] and Merry Hill Centre. There are also numerous shorter bus routes leaving from both stations which give the town centre a link to housing estates including Alumwell, Beechdale, Chuckery, Park Hall and the Manor Hospital.\n\n[[Walsall railway station]] is situated on Station Street in the town centre and is also accessible from the Saddlers shopping centre. There are typically four trains per hour from the station to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham]] and one train per hour to [[Rugeley Trent Valley railway station|Rugeley]] with fewer trains in the evenings and on Sundays. There is also a suburban station at [[Bescot railway station|Bescot]].\n\nWalsall is extremely well connected within the UK road network as it is served by the [[M6 motorway|M6]] which connects the [[M1 motorway]] towards [[London]] and [[M74 motorway]] towards [[Glasgow]]. There are three nearby junctions which serve Walsall on the [[M6 motorway]]: J7, J9 and J10. The stretch between these junctions is one of the busiest in Europe. The town is also served by [[A34 road]] which connects [[Manchester]] and the [[M42 motorway]] towards [[London]], and is connected regionally by the [[A454 road|A454]] Black Country route.\n\nA tram service was erected in the town towards the end of the 19th century and ran until 2 October 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/millennium/1900/1925-1949/1933.html |title=Our Century 1925\u20131949 |publisher=Expressandstar.com |date=2 October 1933 |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Walsall Aerodrome]] operated from the 1930s until 1956.<ref name=\"BCB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/Helliwells-aircraft-component-factory-at-Walsall-airport.htm|title=Helliwells aircraft component factory at Walsall airport|date=25 November 2010|work=Black Country Bugle|accessdate=19 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928060551/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/News/Helliwells-aircraft-component-factory-at-Walsall-airport.htm|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"BCH-1\">{{cite web|url=http://blackcountryhistory.org/collections/getrecord/WAHER_MBL1341/|title=Airfield; S of Aldridge|work=Black Country History|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> The nearest airport to Walsall is [[Birmingham Airport]], which is located within 30 minutes drive.\n\nThe [[Midland Metro]] have currently got services that run from [[Wolverhampton St George's tram stop]] to [[Grand Central tram stop]] and soon the metro will run and operate a tram extension from north of the former [[Wednesbury Town railway station]] across Potter Lane to a stop near [[Brierley Hill]] which will see the metro line use the corridor from Wednesbury Town to Dudley before running street level and back onto the track at Canal Street before branching off to [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre|Merry Hill]] and a tram stop at Brierley Hill.\n\nThe corridor section from Walsall to Wednesbury Town has been preserved for freight traffic to use to [[Round Oak Steel Terminal]] in the near future. It is possible that the metro extension will look to run an extension to Walsall via [[Bescot]] but will utilize the line with either people carriers or [[tram-trains]].\n\nWalsall was also to be part of the former '5' Ws scheme which would have connected it to [[Wolverhampton]], [[Wednesfield]], [[Willenhall]] and [[Wednesbury]]. Walsall Council decided to pull Walsall and Willenhall out of the scheme in favour of reopening the line to Wolverhampton to passengers via Darlaston and Willenhall. A proposal for the new stations to be built is part of a wider investment strategy to improve local services.<ref>{{cite web | title = At last New Willenhall Railway Station plan backed after years of campaigning | url = https://www.expressandstar.com/news/transport/2018/03/07/railway-station-set-for-the-green-light/| publisher = Express & Star}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:White, Hart, Caldmore.jpg|thumb|''White Hart, Caldmore'' Oil painting by an unknown artist, [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] permanent collection, 1976.088.P]]\n\n=== Arboretum and illuminations ===\n[[Walsall Arboretum]] was officially opened on 4 May 1874 by the wealthy Hatherton family. It was hoped that the park would provide \"a healthy change from [[dogfights]], [[bull-baiting]] and [[cockfighting|cockfights]]\", however the 2d ([[old pence]]) admission was not popular with the public and within seven years the council took over ownership to provide free admission.

Named, as was its predecessor, the E M Flint Gallery in memory of Ethel Mary Flint, head of art at Queen Mary's Grammar School, an exhibitor at the Royal Academy, and a former mayor of Walsall, it contains a large number of works by [[Jacob Epstein]] as well as works by [[Van Gogh]], [[Monet]], [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[John Constable|Constable]]. The large gallery space is host to temporary exhibitions.\n\n=== Museums ===\nWalsall has two museums, [[Walsall Museum]] and [[Walsall Leather Museum]]. Walsall Museum features local history objects primarily from the manufacturing trades and also has a space for temporary exhibitions, while the leather museum displays a mixture of leather goods and has recreations of leatherworkers workshops.\n\n=== Public art ===\n[[File:Statue of Sister Dora - geograph.org.uk - 682348.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sister Dora]]\nThe refurbished [[Sister Dora]] statue stands at the crossroads of Park Street and Bridge Street.

The hippo was designed by local architect and sculptor John Wood.\n\n=== Literature ===\nThough the novelist and essayist [[Jerome K. Jerome]] was born in the town, he never wrote about it. Some writers have, including the Walsall born John Petty (1919\u20131973) who set a number of his books in Walsall, most famously ''Five Fags a Day'' (1956). More recently the comic novelist [[Paul McDonald (writer)|Paul McDonald]] has used Walsall as a location for ''Surviving Sting'' (2001) and ''Kiss Me Softly, Amy Turtle'' (2004).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.madasafish.com/~d_hodgkinson/bh-people.htm |title=People \u2013 Brownhills near Walsall West Midlands |publisher=Members.madasafish.com |accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/amyturtle.html |title=Laurahird.com |publisher=Laurahird.com |accessdate=18 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200048/http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/amyturtle.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== TV and radio ===\n[[Big Centre TV]], the local television channel covering Birmingham and the Black Country, is based in Walsall town centre, now known as Birmingham TV.\n\n=== Sport ===\nWalsall's football club, [[Walsall F.C.]], ''the Saddlers'', was founded in 1888 when [[Walsall Town F.C.]] and [[Walsall Swifts F.C.]] merged. They won their first game against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. The club currently play in [[Football League Two]].\n\nThere are also a number of non-league football clubs based within the borough. Most notably Rushall Olympic.\n\nWalsall has a cricket club, [[Walsall Cricket Club]] who won Birmingham League Premier Division in 2006.\n\nWalsall RUFC is Walsall's [[rugby union]] team which is currently competing in [[Midlands 1 West]].\n\nAldridge and Walsall Hockey Club currently plays in the West Midlands Premier League and is managed by Sir [[Mark Grundy]].\n\nWalsall was also once home to [[Formula 1]] constructor [[Ensign Racing]], in Walsall Wood from 1973 to 1980, before moving to [[Chasetown]].\n\nWalsall was home to a [[horse racing course]]. The grandstand was constructed in 1809 at a cost of \u00a31,300 on a piece of land donated by the [[Earl of Bradford]] on a lease of 99 years. Soon after completion, one of the lower compartments was converted into a [[billiards]] room, which contained a table donated by Lord Chichester Spencer of Fisherwick Park. Throughout the 19th century, races were held annually at the racecourse at [[Michaelmas]].<ref>{{cite book| title=History of the Borough and Foreign of Walsall |author=Edward Lees Glew |year=1856 |publisher=J.R.

The building was demolished in 1852 along with other buildings that had fallen into disrepair.<ref>{{cite book| title=History of the Borough and Foreign of Walsall |author=Edward Lees Glew |year=1856 |publisher=J.R.

Robinson |page=17}}</ref>\nIn 1847, the corporation tried to construct a new market hall on the 'Bowling Green', to the rear of the Dragon Inn. The scheme proposed to use a large amount of public money to construct the hall. Shopkeepers feared that their businesses would be affected and demonstrations were held across the town against the proposals. The demonstrations forced the plans to be shelved.<ref name=Glew15 />\n\nWalsall town centre is fast becoming the most popular shopping destination in the Black Country. This is partly because of the ample supply of free or extremely cheap parking available within the town centre, including at two large supermarkets \u2014 Tesco and Asda \u2014 located on opposite sides of the town centre. Crown Wharf Retail Park is the most popular area of shopping, Housing Asda's first non-food store, [[Asda Living]], as well as popular shops and restaurants such as [[Outfit]], [[Smyths Toys]], [[Bank]], [[T.K. Maxx]], [[River Island]], [[Next (restaurant)|Next]], [[Peacocks]], [[Starbucks]] and [[Nando's]].\n\nPark Street remains Walsall's main shopping high street. Well-known retailers such as [[New Look (company)|New Look]], [[Marks & Spencer]], [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]], [[USC (clothing retailer)|USC]] and [[Primark]] are all located on this fully pedestrianized high street. There is one main shopping mall 'Bradford Mall' formerly known as the '[[Saddlers Centre]]' and two smaller malls located in the town centre. 'The Old Square' shopping mall houses [[Debenhams]] and other smaller retailers, while 'Quasar Centre', now known as 'Park Place Shopping Centre', houses [[Wilko's]] and the other smaller retailers. Other shopping destinations include Broadwalk Retail Park and Reedswood Retail Park.\n\nThe area around [[Walsall Art Gallery]] is under redevelopment. A new [[Premier Inn]] hotel has opened along with an 8 screen [[The Light Cinemas]] in addition to popular restaurants such as [[PizzaExpress]], [[TGI Fridays]] and [[Bella Italia]]. There is also a second cinema to be opened across the road opposite Tesco, which will also house popular restaurants.\n\n== Recent changes ==\nProjects due for completion in 2009 and 2010 include [[Walsall Manor Hospital]] redevelopment worth \u00a3174 million, the new Walsall College worth \u00a365 million, the Waterfront South development worth \u00a360 million and the St. Matthew's Quarter worth more than \u00a325 million.

It was not until his later years and after some instability in his life that he got serious about yo-yoing. Brown was looking for a job at the time when came back to the yo-yo trade. Finding himself in a job of assembling yo-yo's for a mall cart, he was thrown into retail one day, making a huge impression on his customers and his boss. He impressed everyone with not only his ability to yo-yo, but also to juggle, showing his multitude of talents. These talents also include cheating on his ex-wife as well as breaking a condom. \n\nAfter working the next two years with his independent cart, fine-tuning his yo-yo skills through hours of practice, Brown joined with [[Duncan Toys Company]]. Working as Duncan's marketing and promotions coordinator, Steve created a following with his creative designs and yo-yo tricks.\n\nBrown worked for Duncan Toys for the start of his career. He worked for Duncan for seven years (1999-2006)<sup>[11]</sup>. Here is where his unique style and flare created a name for himself. Brown was, and is, known for his punk rocker sense of style that he has brought to the yo-yo world. With his tattoo covered arms and past Mohawk hairstyles, he's keeping the hobby of the yo-yo alive in the youth. At contests early in his career, his unique style and accompanying punk rock music helped him to stand out among the other competitors who were either significantly older or significantly younger.\n\nAfter leaving Duncan Toys in 2006, and finding less time to spend yo-yoing with age and a newly established family, Brown kept himself active in the yo-yo community by creating his website 365yoyotricks.com, on which he recorded and posted one original yo-yo trick every day for an entire year in 2011. The following year, Steve outsourced some of the tricks from a few of his favorite yo-yoers, but continued to contribute tricks of his own alongside them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://365yoyotricks.com/|title=365YoYoTricks - One original yoyo trick, every day.|last=Brown|first=Steve|website=365YoYoTricks|language=en-US|access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref> He continued this system in 2013 with a different group of players, but this is no longer an active sight, since Brown stopped posts to the site in 2013. Currently, he works as an editor on another website called yoyonews.com.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://yoyonews.com/|title=Featured (2016) |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |work=yoyonews.com}}</ref> Here he works to keep the yo-yo community alive, and persisting towards creativity. Alongside the creation of his websites, Brown was also sponsored by the Yo-Yo Factory,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.yoyofactory.com/|title=YoYo Factory (2016) |accessdate=May 1, 2016 |work=yoyofacotry.com}}</ref> where they created four specific yo-yo models inspired by / for Brown.\n\nNow, Brown resides in North Olmsted, Ohio with his four kids. He currently works on Yoyonews, keeping up on current yo-yo trends and events all over. In addition to this, he works on the Triple Crown of Yo-yo event, which occurs every year, except in 2015, due to the birth of Brown's second youngest child. He also works at the Caribou Lodge Yo-yo Works.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://shop.yoyoexpert.com/manufacturer/10/Caribou-Lodge|title=YoYo Expert |accessdate=May 1, 2016 |work=show.yoyoexpert.com |publisher=Caribou Lodge}}</ref> There he serves as the team and marketing manager, creating yo-yo's with creative, abstract designs. He has obtained a patent for his yo-yo design involving counterweights. Since Steve himself started off using plain wood yo-yo's, he dedicates this site and company to creating a unique image for the yo-yo community while maintaining a signature old school style that Brown has been recognized for throughout his career. Along with hand crafted yo-yo's, they also produce a limited clothing line and offer video tutorials on their website.\n\n==Competitive Record==\nSteve Brown has won many awards throughout his career in competitive yo-yoing. He has participated in many different contests and championships, and currently holds various titles and placed in several yo-yo competitions. To current date, Steve Brown's competitive records include:\n*1996 World Yo-Yo Contest, 4th place \n*1997 World Yo-Yo Contest - Single A, 4th place\n*1997 World Yo-Yo Contest - Single A freestyle, 3rd place\n*1998 World Yo-Yo Contest - Single A freestyle, 4th place\n** The World Yo-Yo Contest is the most prestigious Yo-Yo competition in the world. The competition is run by the International Yo-Yo Federation or (IYYF) and the host nations Yo-Yo organization. As of 2015 there are 33 countries that participate in the competition. There are more than 1000 yo-yo players and fans that come together to battle for the title of champion. There are six different types of categories for the players to compete in to get the gold medal. The rules are that there is a 30-second wild card, then a one-minute preliminary, after that a 90-second semi-final, then finally a 3-minute final to decide the winner.<ref>{{cite web|last1=WYYC|first1=IYYF|title=Rules for WYYC|url=http://www.worldyoyocontest.com/2014worlds/contest/rules/|website=World Yo-Yo Contest|publisher=World Yo-Yo Contest 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n*1999 Bay Area Classic Invitational - Freestyle, 1st place:\n**During the 1999 Bay Area Classic Invitational, not only did Steve Brown win first place, but also was the first person to use/create the [[Yo-yo|Freehand yo-yo technique]]. This technique has since caught on as an exciting yo-yo trick that may be hard for some to master. The freehand technique is executed by putting a small weight on the end of the string, near the space where your hand is placed and there is no other physical change added to the yo-yo. Steve Brown, the creator of this technique, has created a now popular style of competitive yo-yoing that is exciting to watch and difficult to master. Freehand easily shows each person's style who executes this move.\n*2001 Bay Area Classic Invitational - Freestyle, 1st place\n**During the 2001 Bay Area Classic Invitational, Steve Brown took first place in the competition. What made this win special was that Brown competed in this competition while being blindfolded. After the Invitational was over, Brown was then asked to never enter or participate in this event again.<ref>{{cite news |title=String of Hope |url=http://www.satellite.ac.nz/issues/04-10.pdf |work=Satellite Magazine |publisher=Albany Student's Association Inc. |year=2004 |access-date=September 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014052624/http://www.satellite.ac.nz/issues/04-10.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n*2001 National Yo-Yo Master Award Recipient. \n**This award is only given to a select few that have shown their dedication and contributions to the sport.

It was not until his later years and after some instability in his life that he got serious about yo-yoing. Brown was looking for a job at the time when came back to the yo-yo trade. Finding himself in a job of assembling yo-yo's for a mall cart, he was thrown into retail one day, making a huge impression on his customers and his boss. He impressed everyone with not only his ability to yo-yo, but also to juggle, showing his multitude of talents.\n\nAfter working the next two years with his independent cart, fine-tuning his yo-yo skills through hours of practice, Brown joined with [[Duncan Toys Company]]. Working as Duncan's marketing and promotions coordinator, Steve created a following with his creative designs and yo-yo tricks.\n\nBrown worked for Duncan Toys for the start of his career. He worked for Duncan for seven years (1999-2006)<sup>[11]</sup>. Here is where his unique style and flare created a name for himself. Brown was, and is, known for his punk rocker sense of style that he has brought to the yo-yo world. With his tattoo covered arms and past Mohawk hairstyles, he's keeping the hobby of the yo-yo alive in the youth. At contests early in his career, his unique style and accompanying punk rock music helped him to stand out among the other competitors who were either significantly older or significantly younger.\n\nAfter leaving Duncan Toys in 2006, and finding less time to spend yo-yoing with age and a newly established family, Brown kept himself active in the yo-yo community by creating his website 365yoyotricks.com, on which he recorded and posted one original yo-yo trick every day for an entire year in 2011. The following year, Steve outsourced some of the tricks from a few of his favorite yo-yoers, but continued to contribute tricks of his own alongside them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://365yoyotricks.com/|title=365YoYoTricks - One original yoyo trick, every day.|last=Brown|first=Steve|website=365YoYoTricks|language=en-US|access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref> He continued this system in 2013 with a different group of players, but this is no longer an active sight, since Brown stopped posts to the site in 2013. Currently, he works as an editor on another website called yoyonews.com.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://yoyonews.com/|title=Featured (2016) |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |work=yoyonews.com}}</ref> Here he works to keep the yo-yo community alive, and persisting towards creativity. Alongside the creation of his websites, Brown was also sponsored by the Yo-Yo Factory,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.yoyofactory.com/|title=YoYo Factory (2016) |accessdate=May 1, 2016 |work=yoyofacotry.com}}</ref> where they created four specific yo-yo models inspired by / for Brown.\n\nNow, Brown resides in Cleveland, Ohio with his three kids. He currently works on Yoyonews, keeping up on current yo-yo trends and events all over. In addition to this, he works on the Triple Crown of Yo-yo event, which occurs every year, except in 2015, due to the birth of Brown's youngest child. He also works at the Caribou Lodge Yo-yo Works.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://shop.yoyoexpert.com/manufacturer/10/Caribou-Lodge|title=YoYo Expert |accessdate=May 1, 2016 |work=show.yoyoexpert.com |publisher=Caribou Lodge}}</ref> There he serves as the team and marketing manager, creating yo-yo's with creative, abstract designs. He has obtained a patent for his yo-yo design involving counterweights. Since Steve himself started off using plain wood yo-yo's, he dedicates this site and company to creating a unique image for the yo-yo community while maintaining a signature old school style that Brown has been recognized for throughout his career. Along with hand crafted yo-yo's, they also produce a limited clothing line and offer video tutorials on their website.\n\n==Competitive Record==\nSteve Brown has won many awards throughout his career in competitive yo-yoing. He has participated in many different contests and championships, and currently holds various titles and placed in several yo-yo competitions. To current date, Steve Brown's competitive records include:\n*1996 World Yo-Yo Contest, 4th place \n*1997 World Yo-Yo Contest - Single A, 4th place\n*1997 World Yo-Yo Contest - Single A freestyle, 3rd place\n*1998 World Yo-Yo Contest - Single A freestyle, 4th place\n** The World Yo-Yo Contest is the most prestigious Yo-Yo competition in the world. The competition is run by the International Yo-Yo Federation or (IYYF) and the host nations Yo-Yo organization. As of 2015 there are 33 countries that participate in the competition. There are more than 1000 yo-yo players and fans that come together to battle for the title of champion. There are six different types of categories for the players to compete in to get the gold medal. The rules are that there is a 30-second wild card, then a one-minute preliminary, after that a 90-second semi-final, then finally a 3-minute final to decide the winner.<ref>{{cite web|last1=WYYC|first1=IYYF|title=Rules for WYYC|url=http://www.worldyoyocontest.com/2014worlds/contest/rules/|website=World Yo-Yo Contest|publisher=World Yo-Yo Contest 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n*1999 Bay Area Classic Invitational - Freestyle, 1st place:\n**During the 1999 Bay Area Classic Invitational, not only did Steve Brown win first place, but also was the first person to use/create the [[Yo-yo|Freehand yo-yo technique]]. This technique has since caught on as an exciting yo-yo trick that may be hard for some to master. The freehand technique is executed by putting a small weight on the end of the string, near the space where your hand is placed and there is no other physical change added to the yo-yo. Steve Brown, the creator of this technique, has created a now popular style of competitive yo-yoing that is exciting to watch and difficult to master. Freehand easily shows each person's style who executes this move.\n*2001 Bay Area Classic Invitational - Freestyle, 1st place\n**During the 2001 Bay Area Classic Invitational, Steve Brown took first place in the competition.

The mature [[hermaphrodite]] is oval in shape, reddish-brown with black hairs, 5&nbsp;mm long. When mature, the insect remains stationary, attaches itself to the plant by waxy secretions, and produces a white egg sac in grooves, by extrusion, in the body which encases hundreds of red eggs. The egg sac will grow to be two to three times as long as the body. Newly hatched nymphs are the primary dispersal stage, with dispersion known to occur by wind and by crawling. Early stage nymphs feed from the midrib veins of leaves and small twigs, and do the bulk of the damage. At each molt, they leave at the old feeding point the former skin and the waxy secretions in which they had covered themselves and from which their common name is derived. Unlike many other scale insects, they retain legs and a limited mobility in all life stages. Older nymphs migrate to larger twigs and eventually as adults to branches and the trunk. Their life cycle is highly temperature dependent, as the length of time in each stage of life is longer in cold temperatures than high temperatures.\n\nIn addition to the direct damage from sap sucking, the insects also secrete [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], on which [[sooty mold]] often grows and causes further damage to the host plant. Some [[ants]] will also consume this honeydew.\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Icerya_purchasi_male.jpg| thumb| left|Illustration of a male]]\nMales are rare in hermaphroditic species of ''Icerya''. Males are haploid while females are diploid. Females have an ovitestis that is capable of producing both sperm and oocytes which fertilize internally to produce diploid offspring (females) through a form of hermaphroditism. The cells of the ovitestis are haploid and are derived from excess sperm during matings with males. This has been termed as 'parasitic tissue' and theoretical studies have examined this as a form of [[sexual conflict]] and have examined the possible fates and fitness consequences since females can produce daughters by mating with males or using their parasitic male cell lines. Females that lack ovitestes may preferentially invest in producing sons while females with parasitic tissue should prefer to pass on the genetic material through daughters.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Evolution of Hermaphroditism by an Infectious Male-Derived Cell Lineage: An Inclusive-Fitness Analysis|first1= Andy |first2=Gardner |last1= Laura|last2= Ross| journal= The American Naturalist|volume=178| issue= 2 |year=2011| pages= 191-201|doi=10.1086/660823 }}</ref>\n\nTrue males are uncommon to rare overall, and in many infestations are not present.

Importations of the vedalia ladybird (''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'') in 1888-1889 by [[Charles Valentine Riley|C. V. Riley]], later head of the [[USDA]]'s Division of Entomology, resulted in swift reductions of ''I. purchasi'' populations, saving the burgeoning Californian citrus industry from this destructive pest.\n\nA second biological control, the parasitic fly ''[[Cryptochetum iceryae]]'' has also been introduced to [[California]] as an additional control vector. Use of insecticides as a control is recommended only if no biological control species is present. [[Imidacloprid]] is especially contraindicated, since it has no effect on this species, but is very toxic to ''Rodolia cardinalis''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;General\n*{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/fruit/cottony_cushion_scale.htm |title=Cottony cushion scale, ''Icerya purchasi'' Maskell |accessdate=2008-07-16 |author1=Hamon, A.

Some [[ants]] will also consume this honeydew.\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Icerya_purchasi_male.jpg| thumb| left|Illustration of a male]]\nMales are rare in hermaphroditic species of ''Icerya''. Males are haploid while females are diploid. Females have an ovitestis that is capable of producing both sperm and oocytes which fertilize internally to produce diploid offspring (females) through a form of hermaphroditism. The cells of the ovitestis are haploid and are derived from excess sperm during matings with males. This has been termed as 'parasitic tissue' and theoretical studies have examined this as a form of [[sexual conflict]] and have examined the possible fates and fitness consequences since females can produce daughters by mating with males or using their parasitic male cell lines. Females that lack ovitestes may preferentially invest in producing sons while females with parasitic tissue should prefer to pass on the genetic material through daughters.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Evolution of Hermaphroditism by an Infectious Male-Derived Cell Lineage: An Inclusive-Fitness Analysis|first1= Andy |first2=Gardner |last1= Laura|last2= Ross| journal= The American Naturalist|volume=178| issue= 2 |year=2011| pages= 191-201|doi=10.1086/660823 }}</ref>\n\nTrue males are uncommon to rare overall, and in many infestations are not present.

Importations of the vedalia ladybird (''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'') in 1888-1889 by [[Charles Valentine Riley|C. V. Riley]], later head of the [[USDA]]'s Division of Entomology, resulted in swift reductions of ''I. purchasi'' populations, saving the burgeoning Californian citrus industry from this destructive pest.\n\nA second biological control, the parasitic fly ''[[Cryptochetum iceryae]]'' has also been introduced to [[California]] as an additional control vector. Use of insecticides as a control is recommended only if no biological control species is present. [[Imidacloprid]] is especially contraindicated, since it has no effect on this species, but is very toxic to ''Rodolia cardinalis''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;General\n*{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/fruit/cottony_cushion_scale.htm |title=Cottony cushion scale, ''Icerya purchasi'' Maskell |accessdate=2008-07-16 |author1=Hamon, A.

The Lord orders her to take a fruit from the tree in the front of the temple. To reach, she steps on snake anthill when King Nagendra inside becomes furious, tries to bite her but she requests him to leave until she becomes a mother and he agrees. Bhoolakshmi is blessed with 7 daughters and dies. After her death, King Navabhoja Raju (C.S.R.) remarries Manikyamba (Suryakala) to take care of the children, but the shrew woman harasses the kids and also goads the King to leave the girls in the forest. Bhoolakshmi's aura saves them and they grow up. Years roll by, Bhoolakshmi's brother King Ramavardhi (A. V. Subba Rao) sends his seven sons in search of his niece. In the forest, the younger prince Karyavardhi (N. T. Rama Rao) spots the last girl Balanagamma (Anjali Devi) and both of them fall in love. Now the seven sisters marry the seven princes and Karyavardhi & Balanagamma are blessed with a baby boy. Meanwhile, the wicked wizard Mayala Marathi (S. V. Ranga Rao) challenges his paramour Rani Sangu (Raja Sulochana) to show a beautiful woman in the universe and kidnaps Balanagamma from her palace. After that, he turns Karyavardhi and his army who confronts him, into statues. Here Balanagamma tries to commit suicide when Bhoolakshmi's aura again protects and explains that her son at the age of 12 will rescue her. At present, Balanagamma plots and resists Marathi in the name of vow ''Vratha'' for 12-year to which Marathi agrees. Time passes, Balanagamma's son Balavardhi (Master Satyanarayana) learns that his parents have been held captive by Mayala Marathi. Thereupon, Balavardhi starts, enters the Marathi's den, meets his mother and breakouts the life secret of Marathi. Soon, he sets off on an adventurous journey that takes him across the seven seas to bring the parrot in which lies the Marathi's life. Finally, he eliminates Marathi, frees his parents and returns home to be anointed as the Prince.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[N. T. Rama Rao]] as Karyavardhi\n*[[Anjali Devi]] as Bala Nagamma\n*[[S. V.

The Lord orders her to take a fruit from the tree in the front of the temple. To reach, she steps on snake anthill when King Nagendra inside becomes furious, tries to bite her but she requests him to leave until she becomes a mother and he agrees. Bhoolakshmi is blessed with 7 daughters and dies. After her death, King Navabhoja Raju (C.S.R.) remarries Manikyamba (Suryakala) to take care of the children, but the shrew woman harasses the kids and also goads the King to leave the girls in the forest. Bhoolakshmi's aura saves them and they grow up. Years roll by, Bhoolakshmi's brother King Ramavardhi (A. V. Subba Rao) sends his seven sons in search of his niece. In the forest, the younger prince Karyavardhi (N. T. Rama Rao) spots the last girl Balanagamma (Anjali Devi) and both of them fall in love. Now the seven sisters marry the seven princes and Karyavardhi & Balanagamma are blessed with a baby boy. Meanwhile, the wicked wizard Mayala Marathi (S. V. Ranga Rao) challenges his paramour Rani Sangu (Raja Sulochana) to show a beautiful woman in the universe and kidnaps Balanagamma from her palace. After that, he turns Karyavardhi and his army who confronts him, into statues. Here Balanagamma tries to commit suicide when Bhoolakshmi's aura again protects and explains that her son at the age of 12 will rescue her. At present, Balanagamma plots and resists Marathi in the name of vow ''Vratha'' for 12-year to which Marathi agrees. Time passes, Balanagamma's son Balavardhi (Master Satyanarayana) learns that his parents have been held captive by Mayala Marathi. Thereupon, Balavardhi starts, enters the Marathi's den, meets his mother and breakouts the life secret of Marathi. Soon, he sets off on an adventurous journey that takes him across the seven seas to bring the parrot in which lies the Marathi's life. Finally, he eliminates Marathi, frees his parents and returns home to be anointed as the Prince.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[N. T. Rama Rao]] as Karyavardhi\n*[[Anjali Devi]] as Bala Nagamma\n*[[S. V.

program's third and fourth seasons, the first season of '''''Food Factory USA''''' was produced for FYI and featured only U.S. [[factories]].  The style of the show, including the [[theme music]], [[motion graphics|text graphics]], and two [[narrator]]s, is identical to the original three seasons of ''Food Factory''.  However, the format is somewhat different, catering to the demands of American programmers by eliminating one of the four segments to make room for more [[TV commercials]], and putting those commercials in the middle of each of the three remaining segments instead of between them. In addition, each break is preceded by a trivia question related to the segment, whose answer is given following the break (similar to other series such as ''[[Pawn Stars]]'').  In the spring of 2015, a second season began airing on May 23, two at a time each week as with season four of ''Food Factory''.  The only noticeable difference is the use of graphical text in various colors (consistent within each episode), instead of the silvery grey used in all four previous seasons of the two series.\n\nIn the FYI telecasts, ''Food Factory USA'' also uses only [[English units]], instead of the [[metric system]] measurements used in the original three ''Food Factory'' seasons.  Those seasons, as seen on Food Network Canada (as well in the United States as FYI and its predecessor, Bio), used metric measurements in the narration, with the FYI broadcasts also including metric with English conversions in the graphics.  As aired in the U.S., the fourth season of ''Food Factory'' has no metric units of any kind (narration, graphics, or captions), but the [[closed captioning]] still uses [[Canadian English|Canadian spelling]].\n\n==''Home Factory''==\nAlso in May 2015, a true [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] began airing in the U.S. on FYI.  ''[[Home Factory]]'' is nearly identical to the original series, except that its products are non-food items found in and around the home, ranging from [[towel]]s and [[broom]]s to [[rubber duck]]s and [[lawn flamingo]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[How It's Made]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.locatetv.com/tv/food-factory/7712700/episode-guide Food Factory - Episode Guide] locatetv.com\n* {{cite web|title=Food Factory (II) (2012\u2013 ) Episode List|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2558662/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=21 March 2014}}\n{{italic title}}\n\n{{Food Network (Canada) series}}\n\n[[Category:2012 Canadian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Cineflix shows]]\n[[Category:Documentary television series about industry]]\n[[Category:Food Network (Canadian TV channel) series]]\n[[Category:2010s Canadian documentary television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Undisclosed paid|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name      = Food Factory\n| show_name_2          = Food Factory USA (2014-)\n| caption        = \n| picture_format = frontal narrating\n\n| runtime        = 30 minutes\n| creator        = \n| avid editor    = \n| sound mix      = \n| starring       = \n| country        = Canada\n| network        = [[Food Network (Canada)]]\n| first_aired    = 30 August 2012\n| last_aired     = present\n| num_episodes   = 128\n| num_seasons    = 6\n| list_episodes  = \n| website        = http://www.foodnetwork.ca/ontv/shows/food-factory/show.html?titleid=282413\n}}\n\n'''''Food Factory''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television series produced by [[Cineflix]] airing in that country on the [[Food Network (Canada)|Food Network]], and in the [[United States]] on [[FYI (TV network)|FYI]].

program's third and fourth seasons, the first season of '''''Food Factory USA''''' was produced for FYI and featured only U.S. [[factories]].  The style of the show, including the [[theme music]], [[motion graphics|text graphics]], and two [[narrator]]s, is identical to the original three seasons of ''Food Factory''.  However, the format is somewhat different, catering to the demands of American programmers by eliminating one of the four segments to make room for more [[TV commercials]], and putting those commercials in the middle of each of the three remaining segments instead of between them. In addition, each break is preceded by a trivia question related to the segment, whose answer is given following the break (similar to other series such as ''[[Pawn Stars]]'').  In the spring of 2015, a second season began airing on May 23, two at a time each week as with season four of ''Food Factory''.  The only noticeable difference is the use of graphical text in various colors (consistent within each episode), instead of the silvery grey used in all four previous seasons of the two series.\n\nIn the FYI telecasts, ''Food Factory USA'' also uses only [[English units]], instead of the [[metric system]] measurements used in the original three ''Food Factory'' seasons.  Those seasons, as seen on Food Network Canada (as well in the United States as FYI and its predecessor, Bio), used metric measurements in the narration, with the FYI broadcasts also including metric with English conversions in the graphics.  As aired in the U.S., the fourth season of ''Food Factory'' has no metric units of any kind (narration, graphics, or captions), but the [[closed captioning]] still uses [[Canadian English|Canadian spelling]].\n\n==''Home Factory''==\nAlso in May 2015, a true [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] began airing in the U.S. on FYI.  ''[[Home Factory]]'' is nearly identical to the original series, except that its products are non-food items found in and around the home, ranging from [[towel]]s and [[broom]]s to [[rubber duck]]s and [[lawn flamingo]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[How It's Made]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.locatetv.com/tv/food-factory/7712700/episode-guide Food Factory - Episode Guide] locatetv.com\n* {{cite web|title=Food Factory (II) (2012\u2013 ) Episode List|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2558662/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=21 March 2014}}\n{{italic title}}\n\n{{Food Network (Canada) series}}\n\n[[Category:2012 Canadian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Cineflix shows]]\n[[Category:Documentary television series about industry]]\n[[Category:Food Network (Canadian TV channel) series]]\n[[Category:2010s Canadian documentary television series]]\n", "name_user": "WOSlinker", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix bold", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Factory"}

It was designed by [[St Clare John Byrne]] and built in 1903 as a [[steam yacht]] for [[William Johnston of Liverpool]] by [[Richardson, Duck and Company|Richardson, Duck & Co.]], [[Thornaby-on-Tees]] in Durham, England. Johnston named the Yacht combining letters from the names of his four daughters; Kathleen, ETHel, AILeen, EStele. From 1903\u20131914 it was used as a pleasure craft.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the Royal Navy suddenly found itself in need of additional ships. As a result, on 24 September 1914 Johnston voluntarily handed over the yacht (later receiving financial compensation) to the Royal Navy, for use as an Armed Naval Auxiliary. It became Admiralty Armed Yacht No#118032 in the Yacht Patrol. It patrolled in the North Sea, then transferred to the Irish Sea.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10333356|title=Ship Kethailes , official number: 118032.

It was designed by [[St Clare John Byrne]] and built in 1903 as a [[steam yacht]] for [[William Johnston of Liverpool]] by [[Richardson, Duck and Company|Richardson, Duck & Co.]], [[Thornaby-on-Tees]] in Durham, England. Johnston named the Yacht combining letters from the names of his four daughters; Kathleen, ETHel, AILeen, EStele. From 1903\u20131914 it was used as a pleasure craft.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the Royal Navy suddenly found itself in need of additional ships. As a result, on 24 September 1914 Johnston voluntarily handed over the yacht (later receiving financial compensation) to the Royal Navy, for use as an Armed Naval Auxiliary. It became Admiralty Armed Yacht No#118032 in the Yacht Patrol. It patrolled in the North Sea, then transferred to the Irish Sea.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10333356|title=Ship Kethailes , official number: 118032.

The game was ported to the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Master System]] consoles, among many other systems.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]''-style [[high fantasy]] [[medieval fantasy|medieval world]]. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle.  He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a [[battle axe]]-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed [[basket-hilted sword|broadsword]], looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a [[longsword]]-wielding amazon, [[Tyris Flare]], whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.\n\nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Genesis and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.\n\n==Gameplay==\nProgress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder's henchmen, including men armed with [[club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast [[magic (gaming)|spells]] that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue \"magic potions\" attained by kicking little [[sprite (creature)|sprites]] who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during [[bonus stage]]s in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\n\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the [[Cockatrice]] (which also appeared in ''[[Altered Beast]]''),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_076#page/n31/mode/2up Axes to Grind, The Legend of Golden Axe], [[Retro Gamer magazine]], issue 76. Pages 38\u201345</ref> which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire depending on its color scheme, is found later in the game.\n\nIf the players take too long to advance, skeleton swordsman emerge from the ground, like in ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''. <ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=LVc1QNGo_g0C&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=\"golden+axe\"+\"jason+and+the+argonauts\"#v=onepage&q=\"golden%20axe\"%20\"jason%20and%20the%20argonauts\"&f=false |title = The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012, 2d ed|isbn = 9781476600673|last1 = Fox|first1 = Matt|date = December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the main quest, some home versions of the game included \"duel mode\", a survival mode type game that pitted players against increasingly powerful foes in consecutive rounds of play. This mode also featured a two-player one-on-one option.\n\n==Development==\nLead designer and producer [[Makoto Uchida]] was fond of [[action movies]], particularly the ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]'' films, and wanted to create a game influenced by them. He said that the development team for the game was small and development of the game took about a year.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZAUURPSgYI The Making of Golden Axe: Beast Rider. Part 1].</ref> Uchida's \"idea was to come up with a ''[[Double Dragon]]'' that was not a ''Double Dragon''\u2026 [[Techn\u014ds Japan|Technos]] was an experienced rival who had been working on the ''[[Kunio-Kun]]'' series, so there was no way we could compete if we did the same thing as them. I had a feeling that arcade games should be competitive against the great hit [[Console game|console]] title ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' (created by [[Enix]]) and therefore studied the world of magic and swords, combined this with the gameplay of ''Double Dragon'', and finally came up with the concept of ''Golden Axe''.\"<ref>[http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-golden-axe/ \"The Making Of Golden Axe\"] (2014-12-02). ''RetroGamer.net''. Retrieved 2019-01-31.</ref> Uchida also cited the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' (1987) as an influence, particularly how players could combine button movies and stick presses to perform individual attacks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |date=2018 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-7225-0 |page=150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT1jDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150}}</ref>\n\n==Ports==\nThe Genesis version remained largely faithful to the arcade game, adding a level and a duel mode, along with a new ending. \n\nThe [[IBM PC compatible]] port released in 1990 is similar to the Genesis version, but includes a 256 color [[VGA]] mode as well as  support for [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]],  [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], and [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]] modes. [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] ports of released in late 1990 by Virgin Software are similar to the arcade.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Penn|first=Gary|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-27/page/n77/mode/2up|title=Golden Axe|date=December 1990|newspaper=[[The One (magazine)|The One]]|access-date=|url-status=live|issue=27|page=79}}</ref> The Amiga port is similar to the arcade game, with some palette changes and without parallax scrolling.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Penn|first=Gary|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-27/page/n81/mode/2up|title=Golden Axe|date=December 1990|newspaper=[[The One (magazine)|The One]]|access-date=|url-status=live|issue=27|page=82|quote=When asked: 'Surely having to put all that stuff from the big and hard arcade machine into a poxy little home computer [the Amiga and ST] has meant that he's had to leave stuff out?' programmer Richard Costello replies: 'No, not really. The only major difference is minor graphical details.'}}</ref>\n\nVariations of the original game have also been released. The [[Master System]] version of the game retells the original story from the perspective of Tarik, a barbarian with resemblances to Ax Battler (much like all the other barbarian in the entire series: Kain Grinder, Stern Blade and Kain Blade). While the game is only one-player, it features all of the levels and magic powers of the arcade version. In Japan, ''Golden Axe'' was released by Telenet for the [[PC Engine CD-ROM]] in 1990 with high-quality resampled music and [[cut scene]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrOBNcWLuAU |title=PC Engine Longplay [040&#93; Golden Axe |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = (Gen) 69%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/genesis/563326-golden-axe/index.html |title=Golden Axe for Genesis |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n| MC = (X360) 68/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/golden-axe |title=Golden Axe for Xbox 360 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n| CVG = (Amiga) 90%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue111/Pages/CVG11100064.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref><br />(Atari ST) 91%<ref name=\"amr_axe\">{{cite web|title=Golden Axe Reviews|url=http://amr.abime.net/amr_search.php?search=golden+axe&mag_id=0&action=Find|publisher=Amiga Magazine Rack|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n| CRASH = (Spectrum) 76%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue84/Pages/Crash8400072.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n| EGM = (SMS) 31/40<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/6e/EGM_US_008.pdf |title=''Golden Axe'' |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |date=March 1990 |page=16 |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref><br>(Gen) 29/40<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/6e/EGM_US_008.pdf |title=''Golden Axe'' |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |date=March 1990 |page=20 |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n| SUser = (Spectrum) 71%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue106/Pages/SinclairUser10600071.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n| YSinclair = (Spectrum) 91%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/goldenaxe.htm |title=Golden Axe |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427115303/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/goldenaxe.htm |archivedate=27 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev1Score = (SMS) 890/1000<ref name=\"amr_axe\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]''\n| rev2Score = (Gen) 91%<ref name=\"amr_axe\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Mean Machines]]''\n| rev3Score = (Gen) 91%<ref>{{cite journal|title=Golden Axe review -

The game was ported to the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Master System]] consoles, among many other systems.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]''-style [[high fantasy]] [[medieval fantasy|medieval world]]. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle.  He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a [[battle axe]]-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed [[basket-hilted sword|broadsword]], looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a [[longsword]]-wielding amazon, [[Tyris Flare]], whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.\n\nThe warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Genesis and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.\n\n==Gameplay==\nProgress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder's henchmen, including men armed with [[club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast [[magic (gaming)|spells]] that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue \"magic potions\" attained by kicking little [[sprite (creature)|sprites]] who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during [[bonus stage]]s in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\n\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the [[Cockatrice]] (which also appeared in ''[[Altered Beast]]''),<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_076#page/n31/mode/2up Axes to Grind, The Legend of Golden Axe], [[Retro Gamer magazine]], issue 76. Pages 38\u201345</ref> which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire depending on its color scheme, is found later in the game.\n\nIf the players take too long to advance, skeleton swordsman emerge from the ground, like in ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]''. <ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=LVc1QNGo_g0C&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=\"golden+axe\"+\"jason+and+the+argonauts\"#v=onepage&q=\"golden%20axe\"%20\"jason%20and%20the%20argonauts\"&f=false |title = The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012, 2d ed|isbn = 9781476600673|last1 = Fox|first1 = Matt|date = December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the main quest, some home versions of the game included \"duel mode\", a survival mode type game that pitted players against increasingly powerful foes in consecutive rounds of play. This mode also featured a two-player one-on-one option.\n\n==Development==\nLead designer and producer [[Makoto Uchida]] was fond of [[action movies]], particularly the ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]'' films, and wanted to create a game influenced by them. He said that the development team for the game was small and development of the game took about a year.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZAUURPSgYI The Making of Golden Axe: Beast Rider. Part 1].</ref> Uchida's \"idea was to come up with a ''[[Double Dragon]]'' that was not a ''Double Dragon''\u2026 [[Techn\u014ds Japan|Technos]] was an experienced rival who had been working on the ''[[Kunio-Kun]]'' series, so there was no way we could compete if we did the same thing as them. I had a feeling that arcade games should be competitive against the great hit [[Console game|console]] title ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' (created by [[Enix]]) and therefore studied the world of magic and swords, combined this with the gameplay of ''Double Dragon'', and finally came up with the concept of ''Golden Axe''.\"<ref>[http://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/the-making-of-golden-axe/ \"The Making Of Golden Axe\"] (2014-12-02). ''RetroGamer.net''. Retrieved 2019-01-31.</ref> Uchida also cited the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' (1987) as an influence, particularly how players could combine button movies and stick presses to perform individual attacks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horowitz |first1=Ken |title=The Sega Arcade Revolution: A History in 62 Games |date=2018 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-1-4766-7225-0 |page=150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT1jDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150}}</ref>\n\n==Ports==\nThe Genesis version remained largely faithful to the arcade game, adding a level and a duel mode, along with a new ending. \n\nThe [[IBM PC compatible]] port released in 1990 is similar to the Genesis version, but includes a 256 color [[VGA]] mode as well as  support for [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]],  [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]], and [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]] modes. [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] ports of released in late 1990 by Virgin Software are similar to the arcade.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Penn|first=Gary|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-27/page/n77/mode/2up|title=Golden Axe|date=December 1990|newspaper=[[The One (magazine)|The One]]|access-date=|url-status=live|issue=27|page=79}}</ref> The Amiga port is similar to the arcade game, with some palette changes and without parallax scrolling.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Penn|first=Gary|url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-27/page/n81/mode/2up|title=Golden Axe|date=December 1990|newspaper=[[The One (magazine)|The One]]|access-date=|url-status=live|issue=27|page=82|quote=When asked: 'Surely having to put all that stuff from the big and hard arcade machine into a poxy little home computer [the Amiga and ST] has meant that he's had to leave stuff out?' programmer Richard Costello replies: 'No, not really. The only major difference is minor graphical details.'}}</ref>\n\nVariations of the original game have also been released. The [[Master System]] version of the game retells the original story from the perspective of Tarik, a barbarian with resemblances to Ax Battler (much like all the other barbarian in the entire series: Kain Grinder, Stern Blade and Kain Blade). While the game is only one-player, it features all of the levels and magic powers of the arcade version. In Japan, ''Golden Axe'' was released by Telenet for the [[PC Engine CD-ROM]] in 1990 with high-quality resampled music and [[cut scene]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrOBNcWLuAU |title=PC Engine Longplay [040&#93; Golden Axe |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = (Gen) 69%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/genesis/563326-golden-axe/index.html |title=Golden Axe for Genesis |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n| MC = (X360) 68/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/golden-axe |title=Golden Axe for Xbox 360 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n| CVG = (Amiga) 90%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue111/Pages/CVG11100064.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref><br />(Atari ST) 91%<ref name=\"amr_axe\">{{cite web|title=Golden Axe Reviews|url=http://amr.abime.net/amr_search.php?search=golden+axe&mag_id=0&action=Find|publisher=Amiga Magazine Rack|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n| CRASH = (Spectrum) 76%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue84/Pages/Crash8400072.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n| EGM = (SMS) 31/40<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/6e/EGM_US_008.pdf |title=''Golden Axe'' |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |date=March 1990 |page=16 |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref><br>(Gen) 29/40<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/6e/EGM_US_008.pdf |title=''Golden Axe'' |magazine=Electronic Gaming Monthly |date=March 1990 |page=20 |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n| SUser = (Spectrum) 71%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue106/Pages/SinclairUser10600071.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n| YSinclair = (Spectrum) 91%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/goldenaxe.htm |title=Golden Axe |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427115303/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/goldenaxe.htm |archivedate=27 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev1Score = (SMS) 890/1000<ref name=\"amr_axe\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]''\n| rev2Score = (Gen) 91%<ref name=\"amr_axe\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Mean Machines]]''\n| rev3Score = (Gen) 91%<ref>{{cite journal|title=Golden Axe review -

In the game, players control one of four characters, F. F., Buster, King or Gung Ho, who fight to stop a terrorist plot.<ref name=SU />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''D. D. Crew'' is similar to [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'', which is an archetypal side scrolling beat-em-up game. Up to four player characters move from left to right through each level (most of which are split into 3 or more scenes), fighting with the enemy characters who appear, until they reach a confrontation with a stronger boss character at the end of the level. Once that boss is beaten, the players automatically move on to the next stage. Enemies appear from both sides of the screen and from out of doorways or entrances set into the background, and the player(s) must defeat all of them to progress. If the players try to simply travel through the levels without fighting, the screen will stop scrolling until all current enemies have been defeated, before allowing the players to continue progress. Enemies may move outside the confines of the screen, but players may not. Players will pick up a few weapons along the way, like knives and grenades, as well as other items like some lives and \"MAX\" health points. Players also can pick up and toss enemies either toward the ground or against other enemies. Unlike ''Final Fight'', the graphics are very detailed instead of \"[[cartoon]]y\". One unique feature is a counter that tells how many enemies a player knocked out. Another unique feature is that players also can perform dash attacks by pressing the joystick toward the left or right sides twice, while pressing the attack button during dashing.\n\n==Reception==\nBritish gaming magazine ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'' reviewed ''D.D. Crew'' in 1991, reviewing it alongside ''[[Vendetta (1991 video game)|Vendetta]]'', stating that \"one will probably face into insignificance at the expense of the other.

The Greek goddess [[Athena]] has summoned the souls of four ancient guardians and bestowed their power upon four heroes to stop the evil once again.<ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=1634&image=1  Arcade Flyer, front]</ref> These guardians wield the ability to morph into anthropomorphic beasts to fight their enemies.\n\n==Protagonists==\n'''Ban''' (\u86ee), a [[Martial arts|martial artist]].

His guardian soul is a White Wolf, and he transforms into a White [[Werewolf]].\n\n'''Max''', a [[warrior|fighter]] with a [[boxing]] style.

His guardian soul is a [[Bear]], so he transforms into a Werebear.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game's four main characters are able to morph into [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] \"beasts\" (referred to as Beast Mode) by collecting a Golden Statue [[power-up]] which drops from either a random chest that falls from the sky, or through an anthropomorphic rodent appearing at random times and supplying the player with either a Health Item, Score Item, or Gold Statue. The rodent will drop power-ups after a certain period of time, or if the player attacks him, similar to the elves in ''[[Golden Axe]]''. When the players collect a Statue when already in Beast Mode, the character performs a \"Screen Attack\" destroying all on-screen enemies (if the Statue is collected during a boss fight, the boss is hit hard and usually twice).\n\nThe enemies are also anthropomorphic creatures such as frogs, elephants, lizards, hedgehogs, boars, and others; and include bosses such as Cabrios the Ram-Man (similar to the pagan god [[Baphomet]]) armed with a [[Scythe]], a Flaming Chicken-Man who wields a Sword, an Amazon [[Demon]]ess, and a Weredragon.<ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=1634&image=2  Arcade Flyer, back]</ref> At the end of Stages 2 and 4, players enter a [[Bonus stage]] (destroy a statue or a string of regular enemies) which awards them extra points and health.\n\n==Differences between the US and Japanese versions==\nThe US version of ''Metamorphic Force'' uses a numeric lifepoint counter that doubles as the timer, going down by one lifepoint each tick (much like in \u2018\u2019[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]\u2019\u2019), while the Japanese version uses a  traditional [[Health (gaming)|health bar]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUB5-6W60o  ''Metamorphic Force'' playthrough (Japan)]</ref> The Fifth Stage in the US version consists of a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss rush]] where the player fights the previous bosses in pairs before facing the level's own boss, while in the Japanese version the player fights that level boss only.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7kY0oiSnSw  ''Metamorphic Force'' playthrough (US)]</ref> In addition, some sprites have been completely altered, such as the [[stained glass]] artwork seen during the elevator scene in the Final Stage.\n\n==Legacy==\n* The complete soundtrack to ''Metamorphic Force'' is featured in the 2-disc CD album ''Konami Amusement Sounds '93: Autumn Edition'', published on October 21, 1993 and distributed by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]]. Disc 2 contains all the tracks from the game.<ref>[http://vgmdb.net/album/4391 ''Metamorphic Force'' Soundtrack - Konami Amusement Sounds '93: Autumn]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Track # !!

When the players collect a Statue when already in Beast Mode, the character performs a \"Screen Attack\" destroying all on-screen enemies (if the Statue is collected during a boss fight, the boss is hit hard and usually twice).\n\nThe enemies are also anthropomorphic creatures such as frogs, elephants, lizards, hedgehogs, boars, and others; and include bosses such as Cabrios the Ram-Man (similar to the pagan god [[Baphomet]]) armed with a [[Scythe]], a Flaming Chicken-Man who wields a Sword, an Amazon [[Demon]]ess, and a Weredragon.<ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=1634&image=2  Arcade Flyer, back]</ref> At the end of Stages 2 and 4, players enter a [[Bonus stage]] (destroy a statue or a string of regular enemies) which awards them extra points and health.\n\n==Differences between the US and Japanese versions==\nThe US version of ''Metamorphic Force'' uses a numeric lifepoint counter that doubles as the timer, going down by one lifepoint each tick (much like in \u2018\u2019[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]\u2019\u2019), while the Japanese version uses a  traditional [[Health (gaming)|health bar]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUB5-6W60o  ''Metamorphic Force'' playthrough (Japan)]</ref> The Fifth Stage in the US version consists of a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss rush]] where the player fights the previous bosses in pairs before facing the level's own boss, while in the Japanese version the player fights that level boss only.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7kY0oiSnSw  ''Metamorphic Force'' playthrough (US)]</ref> In addition, some sprites have been completely altered, such as the [[stained glass]] artwork seen during the elevator scene in the Final Stage.\n\n==Legacy==\n* The complete soundtrack to ''Metamorphic Force'' is featured in the 2-disc CD album ''Konami Amusement Sounds '93: Autumn Edition'', published on October 21, 1993 and distributed by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]].
