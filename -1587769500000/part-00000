He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as ''[[trencad\u00eds]]'' which used waste ceramic pieces.\n\nUnder the influence of [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic art]] and Oriental techniques, Gaud\u00ed became part of the ''Modernista'' movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream ''Modernisme'', culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaud\u00ed rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as [[three-dimensional]] [[scale model]]s and moulding the details as he conceived them.\n\nGaud\u00ed's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects.

He was the youngest of five children, of whom three survived to adulthood: Rosa (1844\u20131879), Francesc (1851\u20131876) and Antoni. Gaud\u00ed's family originated in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne region]] in southern France. One of his ancestors, Joan Gaud\u00ed, a hawker, moved to Catalonia in the 17th century; possible origins of Gaud\u00ed's family name include Gaudy or Gaudin.{{sfn|Castellar-Gassol|1999|p=13}}\n[[File:Mas calderera.jpg|thumb|right|El Mas de la Calderera, home of the Gaud\u00ed family in [[Riudoms]]]]\nGaud\u00ed's exact birthplace is unknown because no supporting documents have been found, leading to a controversy about whether he was born in Reus or Riudoms, two neighbouring municipalities of the [[Baix Camp]] district. Most of Gaud\u00ed's identification documents from both his student and professional years gave Reus as his birthplace. Gaud\u00ed stated on various occasions that he was born in Riudoms, his paternal family's village.<ref>Throughout the early part of his life Gaud\u00ed named Reus as his birthplace in all his identity documents, but beginning in 1915 he declared himself Riudoms-born. His dissatisfaction with the rejection of his proposal to restore the Misericordia sanctuary of Reus at around this time may have been the cause of his decision to claim Riudoms as his birthplace.{{harvnb|Bassegoda|1989|p=552}}</ref> Gaud\u00ed was [[baptism|baptised]] in the church of Sant Pere Ap\u00f2stol in Reus the day after his birth under the name \"Antoni Pl\u00e0cid Guillem Gaud\u00ed i Cornet\".{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001a|p=61}}\n\nGaud\u00ed had a deep appreciation for his native land and great pride in his Mediterranean heritage for his art. He believed Mediterranean people to be endowed with creativity, originality and an innate sense for art and design. Gaud\u00ed reportedly described this distinction by stating, \"We own the image. Fantasy comes from the ghosts. Fantasy is what people in the North own. We are concrete. The image comes from the Mediterranean. [[Orestes]] knows his way, where [[Hamlet]] is torn apart by his doubts.\"{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=26}} Time spent outdoors, particularly during summer stays in the Gaud\u00ed family home Mas de la Calderera, afforded Gaud\u00ed the opportunity to study nature. Gaud\u00ed's enjoyment of the natural world led him to join the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya in 1879 at the age of 27. The organisation arranged expeditions to explore Catalonia and southern France, often riding on horseback or walking ten kilometres a day.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=31}}\n[[File:Gaud\u00ed en Montserrat (1904).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaud\u00ed (in the background) with his father (centre), his niece Rosa and doctor Santal\u00f3 during a visit to [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] (1904)]]\nYoung Gaud\u00ed suffered from poor health, including [[rheumatism]], which may have contributed to his reticent and reserved character.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=36}} These health concerns and the hygienist theories of Dr. [[Sebastian Kneipp|Kneipp]]{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=162}} contributed to Gaud\u00ed's decision to adopt [[vegetarianism]] early in his life.{{sfn|Stone|2011}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Metello |first=Nuno |title=History of Vegetarianism\u2014Antoni Gaud\u00ed (1852\u20131926) |work=International Vegetarian Union |year=2008 |url=http://www.ivu.org/history/europe20a/gaudi.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813021134/http://www.ivu.org/history/europe20a/gaudi.html |archivedate=13 August 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> His religious faith and strict vegetarianism led him to undertake several lengthy and severe [[fasting|fasts]].

In 1868 he moved to Barcelona to study teaching in the Convent del Carme. In his adolescent years Gaud\u00ed became interested in [[utopian socialism]] and, together with his fellow students Eduard Toda i G\u00fcell and Josep Ribera i Sans, planned a restoration of the [[Poblet Monastery]] that would have transformed it into a Utopian [[phalanst\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=35}}\n\nBetween 1875 and 1878, Gaud\u00ed completed his compulsory military service in the [[infantry]] regiment in Barcelona as a Military Administrator.

During this time Gaud\u00ed studied architecture at the Llotja School and the Barcelona Higher School of Architecture, graduating in 1878. To finance his studies, Gaud\u00ed worked as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]] for various architects and constructors such as Leandre Serrallach, [[Joan Martorell]], Emili Sala Cort\u00e9s, [[Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano]] and [[Josep Fontser\u00e8]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=36}} In addition to his architecture classes, he studied French, history, economics, philosophy and [[aesthetics]].

He gained wider recognition for his first important commission, the [[Casa Vicens]], and subsequently received more significant proposals. At the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World's Fair of 1878]] Gaud\u00ed displayed a showcase he had produced for the glove manufacturer Comella. Its functional and aesthetic ''modernista'' design impressed Catalan industrialist Eusebi G\u00fcell, who then commissioned some of Gaud\u00ed's most outstanding work: the [[Bodegas G\u00fcell|G\u00fcell wine cellars]], the G\u00fcell pavilions, the [[Palau G\u00fcell]] (G\u00fcell palace), the [[Park G\u00fcell]] (G\u00fcell park) and the crypt of the church of the [[Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]]. Gaud\u00ed also became a friend of the marquis of Comillas, the father-in-law of Count G\u00fcell, for whom he designed \"[[El Capricho]]\" in [[Comillas]].\n\nIn 1883 Gaud\u00ed was put in charge of the recently initiated project to build a Barcelona church called [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia|Bas\u00edlica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] (Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family, or Sagrada Fam\u00edlia). Gaud\u00ed completely changed the initial design and imbued it with his own distinctive style. From 1915 until his death he devoted himself entirely to this project. Given the number of commissions he began receiving, he had to rely on his team to work on multiple projects simultaneously. His team consisted of professionals from all fields of construction. Several of the architects who worked under him became prominent in the field later on, such as [[Josep Maria Jujol]], [[Joan Rubi\u00f3]], [[C\u00e8sar Martinell]], Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols. In 1885, Gaud\u00ed moved to rural [[Sant Feliu de Codines]] to escape the [[cholera]] epidemic that was ravaging Barcelona. He lived in Francesc Ullar's house, for whom he designed a dinner table as a sign of his gratitude.{{sfn|Tarragona|1999|p=22}}\n\n[[File:Carnet Gaud\u00ed (1888).jpg|thumb|left|Gaud\u00ed's exposition licence at the [[Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona]], 1888]]\n\nThe [[Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona|1888 World Fair]] was one of the era's major events in Barcelona and represented a key point in the history of the ''Modernisme'' movement. Leading architects displayed their best works, including Gaud\u00ed, who showcased the building he had designed for the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Trasatl\u00e1ntica (Transatlantic Company). Consequently, he received a commission to restructure the Sal\u00f3 de Cent of the Barcelona City Council, but this project was ultimately not carried out. In the early 1890s Gaud\u00ed received two commissions from outside of Catalonia, namely the [[Episcopal Palace, Astorga]], and the [[Casa Botines]] in [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]]. These works contributed to Gaud\u00ed's growing renown across Spain. In 1891, he travelled to [[M\u00e1laga]] and [[Tangiers]] to examine the site for a project for the Franciscan Catholic Missions that the 2nd marquis of Comillas had requested him to design.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=92}}\n\n[[File:Casa batllo roof.jpg|upright|thumb|Roof architecture at [[Casa Batll\u00f3]]]]\nIn 1899 Gaud\u00ed joined the [[Cercle Art\u00edstic de Sant Lluc]] (Saint Luke artistic circle), a Catholic artistic society founded in 1893 by the bishop [[Josep Torras i Bages]] and the brothers [[Josep Llimona i Bruguera|Josep]] and Joan Llimona.

They reflected his shift to a more personal style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his [[Casa Calvet]]. During the first decade of the century Gaud\u00ed dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as [[Bellesguard]]), the [[Park G\u00fcell]], an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] (Batll\u00f3 house) and the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]] (Mil\u00e1 house), two of his most emblematic works.\n\n[[File:Joan Llimona - San Felipe Neri en la consagraci\u00f3n de la Santa Misa.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Philip Neri celebrating the Holy Mass'' by Joan Llimona (church of Sant Felip Neri, Barcelona).

Finally, in 1906, he settled in a house in the G\u00fcell Park that he owned and which had been constructed by his assistant Francesc Berenguer as a showcase property for the estate. It has since been transformed into the Gaud\u00ed Museum. There he lived with his father (who died in 1906 at the age of 93) and his niece Rosa Egea Gaud\u00ed (who died in 1912 at the age of 36). He lived in the house until 1925, several months before his death, when he began residing inside the workshop of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.\n\nAn event that had a profound impact on Gaud\u00ed's personality was [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in 1909. Gaud\u00ed remained in his house in G\u00fcell Park during this turbulent period. The anticlerical atmosphere and attacks on churches and convents caused Gaud\u00ed to worry for the safety of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, but the building escaped damage.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=250}}\n\nIn 1910, an exhibition in the [[Grand Palais]] of Paris was devoted to his work, during the annual salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France. Gaud\u00ed participated on the invitation of count G\u00fcell, displaying a series of pictures, plans and plaster scale models of several of his works. Although he participated ''hors concours'', he received good reviews from the French press. A large part of this exposition could be seen the following year at the I Sal\u00f3n Nacional de Arquitectura that took place in the municipal exhibition hall of [[El Buen Retiro]] in Madrid.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=551}}\n\nDuring the Paris exposition in May 1910, Gaud\u00ed spent a holiday in [[Vic]], where he designed two [[basalt]] lampposts and wrought iron for the Pla\u00e7a Major of Vic in honor of [[Jaume Balmes]]'s centenary. The following year he resided as a convalescent in [[Puigcerd\u00e0]] while suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. During this time he conceived the idea for the facade of the Passion of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.{{sfn|Puig i Boada|1986|p=166}} Due to ill health he prepared a [[will (law)|will]] at the office of the notary Ramon Cant\u00f3 i Figueres on 9 June, but later completely recovered.{{sfn|Tarragona|1999|p=239}}\n\nThe decade from 1910 was a hard one for Gaud\u00ed. During this decade, the architect experienced the deaths of his niece Rosa in 1912 and his main collaborator Francesc Berenguer in 1914; a severe economic crisis which paralysed work on the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in 1915; the 1916 death of his friend Josep Torras i Bages, bishop of Vic; the 1917 disruption of work at the Colonia G\u00fcell; and the 1918 death of his friend and patron Eusebi G\u00fcell.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=291}} Perhaps because of these tragedies he devoted himself entirely to the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia from 1915, taking refuge in his work. Gaud\u00ed confessed to his collaborators:\n\n{{quote|My good friends are dead; I have no family and no clients, no fortune nor anything. Now I can dedicate myself entirely to the Church.{{sfn|Bonet i Armengol|2001|p=21}}}}\n\nGaud\u00ed dedicated the last years of his life entirely to the \"Cathedral of the Poor\", as it was commonly known, for which he took [[alms]] in order to continue. Apart from his dedication to this cause, he participated in few other activities, the majority of which were related to his Catholic faith: in 1916 he participated in a course about [[Gregorian chant]] at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]] taught by the [[Benedictine]] monk Gregori M. Sunyol.{{sfn|Tarragona|1999|p=164}}\n\nIn 1936, during the course of the [[Spanish Civil War]], Gaud\u00ed's workshop in the [[Sagrada Familia]] was assaulted, destroying a large number of documents, plans and models of the modernist architect.\n\n=== Personal life ===\nGaud\u00ed devoted his life entirely to his profession, remaining single.

Gaud\u00ed is often depicted as unsociable and unpleasant, a man of gruff reactions and arrogant gestures. However, those who were close to him described him as friendly and polite, pleasant to talk to and faithful to friends. Among these, his patrons Eusebi G\u00fcell and the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, stand out, as well as the writers [[Joan Maragall]] and [[Jacint Verdaguer]], the physician Pere Santal\u00f3 and some of his most faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Lloren\u00e7 Matamala.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Amics.htm |language=Catalan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928012528/http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Amics.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |title=Amigos de Gaud\u00ed |accessdate=3 August 2008 |work=Gaudiallgaudi.com |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gaud\u00ed-Ragonesi (1915).jpg|thumb|left|Gaud\u00ed shows the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] to the Papal [[nuncio]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Francesco Ragonesi (1915).

As a young man, he dressed like a [[dandy]] in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging [[gourmet]] taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaud\u00ed ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a [[beggar]], such as after the accident that caused his death.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=13}}\n\nGaud\u00ed left hardly any written documents, apart from technical reports of his works required by official authorities, some letters to friends (particularly to Joan Maragall) and a few journal articles. Some quotes collected by his assistants and disciples have been preserved, above all by Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols, Joan Berg\u00f3s, [[C\u00e8sar Martinell]] and Isidre Puig i Boada. The only written document Gaud\u00ed left is known as the Manuscrito de Reus (Reus Manuscript) (1873\u20131878), a kind of student diary in which he collected diverse impressions of architecture and decorating, putting forward his ideas on the subject.

While walking along the [[Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes]] between Girona and Bail\u00e9n streets, he was struck by a passing number 30 tram and lost consciousness.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001a|p=415}}<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ghosts of Spain |url= |first= Giles |last=Tremlett |isbn=978-0-571-22169-1|page=351|publisher=Faber and Faber, London |date=2006 }}</ref> Assumed to be a beggar because of his lack of identity documents and shabby clothing, the unconscious Gaud\u00ed did not receive immediate aid. Eventually some passers-by transported him in a taxi to the [[Hospital de la Santa Creu|Santa Creu Hospital]], where he received rudimentary care.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=263}}\n\nBy the time that the chaplain of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Mos\u00e9n Gil Par\u00e9s, recognised him on the following day, Gaud\u00ed's condition had deteriorated too severely to benefit from additional treatment. Gaud\u00ed died on 10 June 1926 at the age of 73 and was buried two days later. A large crowd gathered to bid farewell to him in the chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the crypt of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. His gravestone bears this inscription:\n<blockquote>Antonius Gaud\u00ed Cornet. Reusensis. Annos natus LXXIV, vitae exemplaris vir, eximiusque artifex, mirabilis operis hujus, templi auctor, pie obiit Barcinone die X Junii MCMXXVI, hinc cineres tanti hominis, resurrectionem mortuorum expectant.

May he rest in peace.)</blockquote>\n\n== Style ==\n\n=== Gaud\u00ed and ''Modernisme'' ===\n[[File:Cruz cuatro brazos.jpg|thumb|Traditional Gothic ''cross flower'' reinterpreted, one of the most typical features of Gaud\u00ed's works]]\n\nGaud\u00ed's professional life was distinctive in that he never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaud\u00ed was inspired by oriental arts ([[India]], [[Persia]], [[Japan]]) through the study of the [[Historicism|historicist]] architectural theoreticians, such as [[Walter Pater]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[William Morris]]. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the G\u00fcell Palace, the G\u00fcell Pavilions and the [[Casa Vicens]]. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house as well as in the crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Eventually, Gaud\u00ed embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.\n\nDuring his time as a student, Gaud\u00ed was able to study a collection of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included [[Moorish]] monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book ''Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra'' by [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], which he borrowed from the School's library.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=114}} He took various structural and ornamental solutions from [[nazar\u00ed]] and [[mud\u00e9jar]] art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaud\u00ed observed of [[Islamic art]] its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the feeling of open space by enclosing it with barriers.{{sfn|Flores|2002|p=58}}\n\nUndoubtedly the style that most influenced him was the [[Gothic Revival]], promoted in the latter half of the 19th century by the theoretical works of [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. The French architect called for studying the styles of the past and adapting them in a rational manner, taking into account both structure and design.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Els anys d'aprenentatge de Gaud\u00ed|p=44}} Nonetheless, for Gaud\u00ed the Gothic style was \"imperfect\", because despite the effectiveness of some of its structural solutions it was an art that had yet to be \"perfected\". In his own words:\n\n{{quote|text=Gothic art is imperfect, only half resolved; it is a style created by the compasses, a formulaic industrial repetition. Its stability depends on constant propping up by the buttresses: it is a defective body held up on crutches. (...) The proof that Gothic works are of deficient plasticity is that they produce their greatest emotional effect when they are mutilated, covered in ivy and lit by the moon.{{sfn|Flores|2002|p=89}}}}\n\n[[File:Reptil Parc Guell Barcelona.jpg|thumb|The salamander in [[Park G\u00fcell]] has become a symbol of Gaud\u00ed's work.]]\n\nAfter these initial influences, Gaud\u00ed moved towards ''Modernisme'', then in its heyday. ''Modernisme'' in its earlier stages was inspired by historic architecture. Its practitioners saw its return to the past as a response to the industrial forms imposed by the [[Industrial Revolution]]'s technological advances. The use of these older styles represented a moral regeneration that allowed the [[bourgeoisie]] to identify with values they regarded as their cultural roots. The ''[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]'' (rebirth), the revival of Catalan culture that began in the second half of the 19th century, brought more Gothic forms into the Catalan \"national\" style that aimed to combine nationalism and cosmopolitanism while at the same time integrating into the European modernizing movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc42.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120103813/http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc42.htm |archivedate=20 January 2012 |title=El vanguardismo de un tradicionalista |accessdate=3 August 2008 |last=Fontbona |first=Francesc |work=Barcelona Metropolis Mediterranea |language=Spanish |date=July 2002 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nSome essential features of ''Modernisme'' were: an anticlassical language inherited from [[Romanticism]] with a tendency to lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; a strong sense of optimism and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.{{sfn|Flores|2002|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n=== Quest for a new architectural language ===\nGaud\u00ed is usually considered the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any one style or classification. They are imaginative works that find their main inspiration in nature. Gaud\u00ed studied organic and [[anarchy|anarchic]] geometric forms of nature thoroughly, searching for a way to give expression to these forms in architecture. Some of his greatest inspirations came from visits to the mountain of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], the caves of [[Mallorca]], the [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] caves in [[Collbat\u00f3]], the crag of Fra Guerau in the [[Prades Mountains]] behind Reus, the Pareis mountain in the north of Mallorca and [[Sant Miquel del Fai]] in Bigues i Riells.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=198}}\n\n==== Geometrical forms ====\n[[File:Sagrada Familia nave roof detail.jpg|thumb|The nave in the Sagrada Familia with a [[hyperboloid]] [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]. Inspiration from nature is taken from a tree, as the pillar and branches symbolise trees rising up to the roof.]]\nThis study of nature translated into his use of [[Ruled surface|ruled geometrical forms]] such as the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], the [[hyperboloid]], the [[helicoid]] and the [[cone (geometry)|cone]], which reflect the forms Gaud\u00ed found in nature.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=266}} Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the [[generatrix]], as it moves over one or several lines known as [[Directrix (conic section)|directrices]]. Gaud\u00ed found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[reed (plant)|reeds]] and [[bone]]s; he used to say that there is no better structure than the trunk of a tree or a [[human skeleton]]. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaud\u00ed discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture. He used to equate the [[helicoid]] form to movement and the [[hyperboloid]] to light. Concerning ruled surfaces, he said:\n\n{{quote|text=Paraboloids, hyperboloids and helicoids, constantly varying the incidence of the light, are rich in matrices themselves, which make ornamentation and even modelling unnecessary.{{sfn|Puig i Boada|2004|p=238}}}}\n\nAnother element widely used by Gaud\u00ed was the [[catenary arch]]. He had studied [[geometry]] thoroughly when he was young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised the virtues of the catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of [[suspension bridge]]s. Gaud\u00ed was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]], the Teresian College, the crypt of the [[Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]] and the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] allowed Gaud\u00ed to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling [[tangential]] forces.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Apunts sobre la intu\u00efci\u00f3 cient\u00edfica de Gaud\u00ed|p=168}}\n\nGaud\u00ed evolved from [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to [[spatial geometry]], to [[ruled surface|ruled geometry]]. These constructional forms are highly suited to the use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaud\u00ed frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional [[Catalan vault]], using the brick laid flat instead of on its side.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=12}} This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research and experience in his masterpiece, the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]]. Gaud\u00ed conceived the interior of the church as if it were a forest, with a set of tree-like [[columns]] divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid [[vault (architecture)|vaults]]. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn helicoidal shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created a structure that is now known as [[fractal]].{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Gaud\u00ed: geometria, estructura i construcci\u00f3|p=144}} Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for [[buttresses]], as required by the neo-Gothic style.{{sfn|Flores|2002|pp=91\u201392}} Gaud\u00ed thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.\n\n==== Surpassing the Gothic ====\nThis new constructional technique allowed Gaud\u00ed to achieve his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their center where Gothic vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between vaults, where Gothic vaults have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaud\u00ed employed to give the impression of a starry sky.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Tecnica%20arq.htm |work=Gaudiallgaudi.com |language=Spanish |archivedate=29 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929122133/http://gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Tecnica%20arq.htm |title=T\u00e9cnica arquitect\u00f3nica de Gaud\u00ed |accessdate=3 August 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nGaud\u00ed complemented this organic vision of architecture with a unique spatial vision that allowed him to conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=16}} Because of this spatial conception, Gaud\u00ed always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works\u2014in fact, only when required by authorities.\n\n[[File:Maqueta funicular.jpg|thumb|left|An upside-down force model of the [[Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]], Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Museum]]\n\nAnother of Gaud\u00ed's innovations in the technical realm was the use of a scale model to calculate structures: for the church of the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell, he built a 1:10 scale model with a height of {{convert|4|m}} in a shed next to the building. There, he set up a model that had strings with small bags full of [[birdshot]] hanging from them. On a drawing board that was attached to the ceiling he drew the floor of the church, and he hung the strings (for the catenaries) with the birdshot (for the weight) from the supporting points of the building\u2014columns, intersection of walls. These weights produced a catenary curve in both the arches and vaults. At that point, he took a picture that, when inverted, showed the structure for columns and arches that Gaud\u00ed was looking for. Gaud\u00ed then painted over these photographs with [[gouache]] or [[pastel]]. The outline of the church defined, he recorded every single detail of the building: architectural, stylistic and decorative.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nGaud\u00ed's position in the history of architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaud\u00ed's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from [[Dorian mode|Doric]] to [[Baroque]] via [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaud\u00ed passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the [[Bauhaus]] school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaud\u00ed, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the ''modernista'' architect.\n\nAmong other factors that led to the initial neglect of the Catalan architect's work was that despite having numerous assistants and helpers, Gaud\u00ed created no school of his own and never taught, nor did he leave written documents. Some of his subordinates adopted his innovations, above all Francesc Berenguer and [[Josep Maria Jujol]]; others, like [[C\u00e8sar Martinell]], Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols graduated towards [[Noucentisme]], leaving the master's trail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc65.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120181510/http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc65.htm |archivedate=20 January 2012 |title=Dise\u00f1o: entre el legado y la invenci\u00f3n de la tradici\u00f3n |accessdate=3 August 2008 |last=Pibernat |first=Oriol |language=Spanish |work=Barcelona Metropolis Mediterranea |date=July 2002 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Despite this, a degree of influence can be discerned in some architects that either formed part of the ''Modernista'' movement or departed from it and who had had no direct contact with him, such as Josep Maria Pericas (Casa Al\u00f2s, [[Ripoll]]), Bernard\u00ed Martorell ([[Olius]] cemetery) and Llu\u00eds Muncunill (Masia Freixa, [[Terrassa]]). Nonetheless, Gaud\u00ed left a deep mark on 20th-century architecture: masters like [[Le Corbusier]] declared themselves admirers, and the works of other architects like [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[F\u00e9lix Candela]], [[Eduardo Torroja]] and [[Santiago Calatrava]] were inspired by Gaud\u00ed. [[Frei Otto]] used Gaud\u00ed's forms in the construction of the [[Munich Olympic Stadium]]. In Japan, the work of [[Kenji Imai (architect)|Kenji Imai]] bears evidence of Gaud\u00ed's influence, as can be seen in the [[Twenty-Six Martyrs Museum and Monument|Memorial for the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan]] in [[Nagasaki]] (Japanese National Architecture Award in 1962), where the use of Gaud\u00ed's famous \"trencad\u00eds\" stands out.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001b|p=74}} <!--Art critics in research and teaching positions since 1950 have given the artist a well-deserved position within 20th-century architecture.-->\n\n=== Design and craftsmanship ===\n[[File:WLM14ES - Barcelona Finca G\u00fcell 58 02 de julio de 2011 - .jpg|thumb|Entrance gate of the [[G\u00fcell Pavilions]]]]\n\nDuring his student days, Gaud\u00ed attended craft workshops, such as those taught by Eudald Punt\u00ed, Lloren\u00e7 Matamala and Joan O\u00f1\u00f3s, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, [[carpentry]], [[wrought ironwork]], [[stained glass]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[plaster]] modelling, etc.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=12}} He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaud\u00ed took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including all the elements of his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.\n\nGaud\u00ed was also an innovator in the realm of craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces (\"[[trencad\u00eds]]\") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented a new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of [[primary colours]], and sometimes a neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Gaud\u00ed-Orfe\u00f3 (1922).jpg|thumb|left|Dedicatory object for [[Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0]] (1922), designed by Gaud\u00ed, drawn by Francesc Quintana and coloured by [[Josep Maria Jujol]]]]\nThis was how he personally designed many of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the [[anatomy]] of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure he was about to sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.{{sfn|Giordano|2011|pp=76\u201377}}\n\n==== Urban spaces and landscaping ====\nGaud\u00ed also practiced landscaping, often in urban settings. He aimed to place his works in the most appropriate natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the [[slate]] of Bellesguard and the grey [[Bierzo]] [[granite]] in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the G\u00fcell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the G\u00fcell Pavilions. Gaud\u00ed's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself\u2014here the Montserrat rock\u2014nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned the path to the Holy Cave.\n\n==== Interiors ====\n[[File:Interior Casa Vicens.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Casa Vicens]]]]\nEqually, Gaud\u00ed stood out as [[interior decorator]], decorating most of his buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case he knew how to apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings\u2014whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to [[liturgical]] furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office at the beginning of his career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of [[Comillas]], he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batll\u00f3 and Mil\u00e0 houses, of the G\u00fcell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. It is noteworthy that Gaud\u00ed studied some [[ergonomy]] in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at [[Gaudi House Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaudiclub.com/esp/e_vida/mobiliario.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926212803/http://www.gaudiclub.com/esp/e_vida/mobiliario.asp |archivedate=26 September 2011 |title=El mobiliario de Gaud\u00ed |accessdate=3 August 2008 |language=Spanish |work=Gaudiclub.com |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n[[File:Gaudi-prie-dieu.jpg|left|thumb|[[Prie-dieu|Prie Dieu]], or prayer desk, designed by Gaud\u00ed for [[Casa Batll\u00f3]]]]\nAnother aspect is the intelligent distribution of space, always with the aim of creating a comfortable, intimate, interior atmosphere. For this purpose, Gaud\u00ed would divide the space into sections, adapted to their specific use, by means of low walls, dropped ceilings, sliding doors and wall closets. Apart from taking care of every detail of all structural and ornamental elements, he made sure his constructions had good lighting and ventilation. For this purpose, he studied each project's orientation with respect to the cardinal points, as well as the local climate and its place in its surroundings. At that time, there was an increasing demand for more domestic comfort, with piped water and gas and the use of electric light, all of which Gaud\u00ed expertly incorporated. For the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, for example, he carried out thorough studies on [[acoustics]] and illumination, in order to optimise them. With regard to light, he stated:\n\n{{quote|text=Light achieves maximum harmony at an inclination of 45\u00b0, since it resides on objects in a way that is neither horizontal nor vertical. This can be considered medium light, and it offers the most perfect vision of objects and their most exquisite nuances. It is the Mediterranean light.{{sfn|Puig i Boada|2004|p=96}}}}\n\nLighting also served Gaud\u00ed for the organisation of space, which required a careful study of the gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Art, oficis i disseny en Gaud\u00ed|p=250}}\n\n== Works ==\n{{Main|List of Gaud\u00ed buildings}}\nGaud\u00ed's work is normally classed as ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'', and it belongs to this movement because of its eagerness to renovate without breaking with tradition, its quest for modernity, the ornamental sense applied to works, and the multidisciplinary character of its undertakings, where craftsmanship plays a central role. To this, Gaud\u00ed adds a dose of the baroque, adopts technical advances and continues to use traditional architectural language. Together with his inspiration from nature and the original touch of his works, this amalgam gives his works their personal and unique character in the history of architecture.\n\nChronologically, it is difficult to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaud\u00ed's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to immerse himself completely in the ''modernista'' movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaud\u00ed's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Berg\u00f3s, according to plastic and structural criteria. Berg\u00f3s establishes five periods in Gaud\u00ed's productions: preliminary period, mud\u00e9jar-morisco (Moorish/mud\u00e9jar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and organic synthesis.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|pp=51\u201368}}\n\n=== Early works ===\nGaud\u00ed's first works both from his student days and the time just after his graduation stand out for the precision of their details, the use of geometry and the prevalence of mechanical considerations in the structural calculations.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=51}}\n\n==== University years ====\nDuring his studies, Gaud\u00ed designed various projects, among which the following stand out: a cemetery gate (1875), a Spanish pavilion for the Philadelphia World Fair of 1876, a quay-side building (1876), a courtyard for the [[Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona]] (1876), a monumental fountain for the [[Pla\u00e7a Catalunya]] in Barcelona (1877) and a university [[assembly hall]] (1877).{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|pp=24\u201329}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Student works\n|-\n| [[File:Puerta cementerio (1875).jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Embarcadero.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Fuente Plaza Catalu\u00f1a.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Paraninfo.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Cemetery gate (1875)\n| Quay-side building (1876)\n| Fountain in Pla\u00e7a Catalunya (1877)\n| University assembly hall (1877)\n|}\n\nAntoni Gaud\u00ed started his professional career while still at university. To pay for his studies, he worked as a draughtsman for some of the most outstanding Barcelona architects of the time, such as [[Joan Martorell]], [[Josep Fontser\u00e8]], [[Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano]], Leandre Serrallach and Emili Sala Cort\u00e9s.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=36}} Gaud\u00ed had a long-standing relationship with Josep Fontser\u00e8, since his family was also from Riudoms and they had known each other for some time. Despite not having an architecture degree, Fontser\u00e8 received the commission from the city council for the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]] development, carried out between 1873 and 1882. For this project, Gaud\u00ed was in charge of the design of the Park's entrance gate, the bandstand's balustrade and the water project for the monumental fountain, where he designed an artificial cave that showed his liking for nature and the organic touch he would give his architecture.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=111}}\n\nGaud\u00ed worked for [[Francisco de Paula del Villar]] on the apse of the Montserrat monastery, designing the niche for the image of the [[Virgin of Montserrat|Black Virgin of Montserrat]] in 1876. He would later substitute Villar in the works of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. With Leandre Serrallach, he worked on a tram line project to Villa Arcadia in Montju\u00efc. Eventually, he collaborated with Joan Martorell on the Jesuit church on Carrer Casp and the Salesian convent in Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as the Villaricos church (Almer\u00eda). He also carried out a project for Martorell for the competition for a new facade for [[Cathedral of Santa Eulalia|Barcelona cathedral]], which was never accepted. His relationship with Martorell, whom he always considered one of his main and most influential masters, brought him unexpected luck; he later recommended Gaud\u00ed for the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.\n\n==== Early post-graduation projects ====\nAfter his graduation as an architect in 1878, Gaud\u00ed's first work was a set of lampposts for the [[Pla\u00e7a Reial]], the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Matar\u00f3 cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=129}} For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Pla\u00e7a Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the [[La Merc\u00e8|Merc\u00e8]] festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a [[marble]] base, they have a decoration in which the [[caduceus]] of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Early post-graduate works\n|-\n| [[File:Pla\u00e7a Reial02.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Kiosco Girossi.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Vitrina Comella.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Farmacia Gibert.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Lampposts\n| Girossi newsstands\n| Esteban Comella display\n| Gibert Pharmacy\n|}\n\nThe Girossi newsstands project, which was never carried out, was a commission from the tradesman Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 [[newsstands]], spread throughout Barcelona. Each would have included a public lavatory, a flower stand and glass panels for advertisements as well as a clock, a calendar, a [[barometer]] and a [[thermometer]]. Gaud\u00ed conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble and glass slabs, crowned by a large iron and glass roof, with a gas illumination system.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=119}}\n\nThe Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Matar\u00f3 Workers' Cooperative) was Gaud\u00ed's first big project, on which he worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pag\u00e8s i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative's head office in Matar\u00f3, comprised a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaud\u00ed used the catenary arch for the first time, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme.{{sfn|Flores|2002|p=26}} He also used ceramic tile decoration for the first time in the services building. Gaud\u00ed laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative's banner, with the figure of a [[bee]], symbol of industriousness.\n\nIn May 1878 Gaud\u00ed designed a display cabinet for the Esteban Comella glove factory, which was exhibited in the Spanish pavilion at the Paris World Exhibition that year.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=139}} It was this work that attracted the attention of the entrepreneur [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]], visiting the French capital; he was so impressed that he wanted to meet Gaud\u00ed on his return, beginning a long friendship and professional collaboration. G\u00fcell became Gaud\u00ed's main patron and sponsor of many of his large projects.\n\n==== First G\u00fcell projects ====\nG\u00fcell's first task for Gaud\u00ed, that same year, was the design of the furniture for the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being constructed by Joan Martorell, Gaud\u00ed's teacher, at the request of the Marquis of Comillas, G\u00fcell's father in law. Gaud\u00ed designed a chair, a bench and a prayer stool: the chair was upholstered with velvet, finished with two eagles and the Marquis's coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Lloren\u00e7 Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.\n\nAlso in 1878 he drew up the plans for a theatre in the former town of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona); Gaud\u00ed did not take part in the construction of the theatre, which no longer exists. The following year he designed the furniture and counter for the Gibert Pharmacy, with [[marquetry]] of Arab influence. The same year he made five drawings for a procession in honour of the poet Francesc Vicent Garcia i Torres in [[Vallfogona de Riucorb]], where this celebrated 17th-century writer and friend of [[Lope de Vega]] was the parish priest. Gaud\u00ed's project was centred on the poet and on several aspects of agricultural work, such as reaping and harvesting grapes and olives; however, as a result of organisational problems Gaud\u00ed's ideas were not carried out.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=57}}\n\nBetween 1879 and 1881 he drew up a proposal for the decoration of the church of Sant Paci\u00e0, belonging to the Colegio de Jes\u00fas-Mar\u00eda in Sant Andreu del Palomar: he created the [[altar]] in a Gothic style, the [[monstrance]] with [[Byzantine]] influence, the [[mosaic]]s and the lighting, as well as the school's furniture. The church caught fire during the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] of 1909, and now only the mosaics remain, of \"opus tesselatum\", probably the work of the Italian mosaicist Luigi Pellerin.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=156}} He was given the task of decorating the church of the Colegio de Jes\u00fas-Mar\u00eda in Tarragona (1880\u20131882): he created the altar in white Italian marble, and its front part, or [[antependium]], with four columns bearing medallions of polychrome [[alabaster]], with figures of angels; the [[ostensory]] with gilt wood, the work of Eudald Punt\u00ed, decorated with rosaries, angels, [[tetramorph]] symbols and the dove of the Holy Ghost; and the choir stalls, which were destroyed in 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=161}}\n\nIn 1880 he designed an electric lighting project for Barcelona's Muralla de Mar, or [[seawall]], which was not carried out. It consisted of eight large iron streetlamps, profusely decorated with plant [[motif (music)|motifs]], [[frieze]]s, shields and names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition for the construction of the San Sebasti\u00e1n social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladr\u00e9n Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los R\u00edos; Gaud\u00ed submitted a project that synthesised several of his earlier studies, such as the fountain for the Pla\u00e7a Catalunya and the courtyard of the Provincial Council.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=181}}\n\n==== Collaboration with Martorell ====\n[[File:Gaud\u00ed- Martorell- Catedral BCN (1887).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaud\u00ed's drawing for the facade of the [[Barcelona Cathedral]]]]\nA new task of the G\u00fcell-L\u00f3pez's for [[Comillas]] was the [[gazebo]] for [[Alfonso XII]]'s visit to the [[Cantabria]]n town in 1881. Gaud\u00ed designed a small pavilion in the shape of a [[Hindu]] [[turban]], covered in mosaics and decorated with an abundance of small bells which jingled constantly. It was subsequently moved into the G\u00fcell Pavilions.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=93}}\n\nIn 1882 he designed a Benedictine monastery and a church dedicated to the Holy Spirit in [[Villaricos]] ([[Cuevas de Vera]], [[Almer\u00eda]]) for his former teacher, Joan Martorell. It was of neo-Gothic design, similar to the Convent of the Salesians that Gaud\u00ed also planned with Martorell. Ultimately it was not carried out, and the project plans were destroyed in the looting of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=183}} The same year he was tasked with constructing a [[hunting lodge]] and [[wine cellar]]s at a country residence known as La Cuadra, in Garraf (Sitges), property of baron Eusebi G\u00fcell. Ultimately the wine cellars, but not the lodge, were built some years later. With Martorell he also collaborated on three other projects: the church of the Jesuit School in Carrer Caspe; the Convent of the Salesians in Passeig de Sant Joan, a neo-Gothic project with an altar in the centre of the crossing; and the facade project for Barcelona cathedral, for the competition convened by the cathedral chapter in 1882, ultimately won by Josep Oriol Mestres and August Font i Carreras.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|pp=187\u2013194}}\n\nGaud\u00ed's collaboration with Martorell was a determining factor in Gaud\u00ed's recommendation for the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. The church was the idea of Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of the Devotees of Saint Joseph Association, which acquired a complete block of Barcelona's [[Eixample]] district.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=113}} The project was originally entrusted to Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, who planned the construction of a neo-Gothic church, on which work began in 1882. However, the following year Villar resigned due to disagreements with the construction board, and the task went to Gaud\u00ed, who completely redesigned the project, apart from the part of the crypt that had already been built.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=117}} Gaud\u00ed devoted the rest of his life to the construction of the church, which was to be the synthesis of all of his architectural discoveries.\n\n=== Orientalist period ===\nDuring these years Gaud\u00ed completed a series of works with a distinctly oriental flavour, inspired by the art of the Middle and Far East (India, Persia, Japan), as well as Islamic-Hispanic art, mainly [[Mudejar]] and [[Nazari]]. Gaud\u00ed used ceramic tile decoration abundantly, as well as Moorish arches, columns of exposed brick and pinnacles in the shape of pavilions or domes.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=52}}\n\nBetween 1883 and 1888 he constructed the [[Casa Vicens]], commissioned by stockbroker Manuel Vicens i Montaner. It was constructed with four floors, with facades on three sides and an extensive garden, including a monumental brick fountain. The house was surrounded by a wall with iron gates, decorated with [[Sabal|palmetto]] leaves, work of Lloren\u00e7 Matamala. The walls of the house are of stone alternated with lines of tile, which imitate yellow flowers typical of this area; the house is topped with chimneys and turrets. In the interior the polychrome wooden roof beams stand out, adorned with floral themes of [[papier mach\u00e9]]; the walls are decorated with vegetable motifs, as well as paintings by Josep Torrescasana; finally, the floor consists of Roman-style mosaics of \"opus tesselatum\". Among the most original rooms is the smoking room, notable the ceiling, decorated with Moorish honeycomb-work, reminiscent of the [[Generalife]] in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=107}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Orientalist works\n|-\n| [[File:Vicens03.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Capricho gaudi 201108.jpg|120px]]\n| [[File:Pavellons G\u00fcell01.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Palau G\u00fcell, Antoni Gaudi, Barcelona 1.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Trasatl\u00e1ntica (1888).jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Casa Vicens (1883\u201388)\n| [[El Capricho]] (1883\u201385)\n| G\u00fcell Pavilions (1884\u201387)\n| Palau G\u00fcell (1886\u201388)\n| Compa\u00f1\u00eda Trasatl\u00e1ntica (1888)\n|}\nIn the same year, 1883, Gaud\u00ed designed the [[Altarpiece of Alella|Sant\u00edsimo Sacramento chapel for the parish church of San F\u00e9lix de Alella]], as well as some topographical plans for the Can Rosell de la Llena country residence in Gelida. He also received a commission to build a small annex to the Palacio de Sobrellano, for the Baron of Comillas, in the [[Cantabria]]n town of the same name. Known as El Capricho, it was commissioned by M\u00e1ximo D\u00edaz de Quijano and constructed between 1883 and 1885. Crist\u00f2for Cascante i Colom, Gaud\u00ed's fellow student, directed the construction. In an oriental style, it has an elongated shape, on three levels and a cylindrical tower in the shape of a Persian minaret, faced completely in ceramics. The entrance is set behind four columns supporting depressed arches, with capitals decorated with birds and leaves, similar to those that can be seen at the Casa Vicens. Notable are the main lounge, with its large [[sash window]], and the smoking room with a ceiling consisting of a false Arab-style stucco vault.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=15}}\n\nGaud\u00ed carried out a second commission from Eusebi G\u00fcell between 1884 and 1887, the G\u00fcell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now on the outskirts of Barcelona. G\u00fcell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarri\u00e0, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuy\u00e0s de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 to make way for the [[Palau Reial de Pedralbes|Royal Palace of Pedralbes]]. Gaud\u00ed undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with [[symbology]] allusive to the myths of [[Hercules]] and the [[Garden of the Hesperides]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|pp=125\u2013126}} The buildings consist of a stable, covered [[longeing]] ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows<!-- , and covered in a variety of colours-->; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real C\u00e1tedra Gaud\u00ed, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.\n\nIn 1885 Gaud\u00ed accepted a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promoter of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, for an [[altar]] in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained permission from the Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished [[mahogany]], with a slab of [[white marble]] in the centre for [[relics]]. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of [[Saint Francis of Paola]], [[Saint Teresa of Avila]] and the [[Holy Family]] and closed with a curtain of crimson embroidery. It was made by the cabinet maker Frederic Lab\u00f2ria, who also collaborated with Gaud\u00ed on the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=281}}\n\nShortly after, Gaud\u00ed received an important new commission from G\u00fcell: the construction of his family house, in the [[Carrer Nou de la Rambla]] in Barcelona. The [[Palau G\u00fcell]] (1886\u20131888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions such as those in Carrer Montcada. Gaud\u00ed designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent [[parabolic arch]] above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan O\u00f1\u00f3s. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaud\u00ed used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=128}} He designed the interior of the palace with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire in the form of a [[Lantern (architecture)|lantern tower]], which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron [[weather vane]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=290}}\n\nOn the occasion of the World Expo held in Barcelona in 1888, Gaud\u00ed constructed the pavilion for the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Trasatl\u00e1ntica, property of the Marquis of Comillas, in the Maritime Section of the event. He created it in a Granadinian Nazari style, with horseshoe arches and stucco decoration; the building survived until the Passeig Mar\u00edtim was opened up in 1960. In the wake of the event he received a commission from Barcelona Council to restore the Sal\u00f3 de Cent and the grand stairs in Barcelona City Hall, as well as a chair for the queen Maria Cristina; only the chair was made, and Mayor [[Francesc de Paula Rius i Taulet|Francesc Rius i Taulet]] presented it to the Queen.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=313}}\n\n=== Neo-Gothic period ===\nDuring this period Gaud\u00ed was inspired above all by mediaeval [[Gothic art]], but wanted to improve on its structural solutions. [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-gothic]] was one of the most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/history392.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015110704/http://all-art.org/history392.html |archivedate=15 October 2011 |title=The 18th and 19th Centuries: Neoclassicism and Romanticism: Gothic Revival |accessdate=18 October 2011 |work=All-art.org |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Gaud\u00ed studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in Le\u00f3n and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of [[ruled surface]]s, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=56}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Neo-gothic works\n|-\n| [[File:Teresianas01.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Palacio episcopal de Astorga.JPG|150px]]\n| [[File:Casabotines1.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Celler G\u00fcell01.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Bellesguard04.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Teresian College\n| [[Episcopal Palace, Astorga|Episcopal Palace]]\n| [[Casa Botines]]\n| Bodegues G\u00fcell\n| Torre Bellesguard\n|}\nThe first example was the Teresian College (''Col\u00b7legi de les Teresianes'') (1888\u20131889), in Barcelona's Carrer Ganduxer, commissioned by San Enrique de Oss\u00f3. Gaud\u00ed fulfilled the wish of the order that the building should be austere, in keeping with their vows of poverty. He designed a simple building, using bricks for the exterior and some brick elements for the interior. Wrought ironwork, one of Gaud\u00ed's favourite materials, appeared on the facades. The building is crowned by a row of [[merlon]]s which suggest a castle, a possible reference to [[Saint Teresa of Avila|Saint Teresa]]'s ''Interior Castle''.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=33}} The corners have brick pinnacles topped by helicoidal columns and culminate in a four-armed cross, typical of Gaud\u00ed's works, and with ceramic shields bearing various symbols of the order. The interior includes a corridor which is famous for the series of catenary arches that it contains. These elegant arches are decorative and support the ceiling and the floor above. For Gaud\u00ed, the catenary arch was an ideal constructional element, capable of supporting great loads with slender masonry.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=94}}\n\nGaud\u00ed received his next commission from a clergyman who had been a boyhood friend in his native Reus. When he was appointed bishop of Astorga, Joan Baptista Grau i Vallespin\u00f3s asked Gaud\u00ed to design a new episcopal palace for the city, as the previous building had caught fire. Constructed between 1889 and 1915, in a neo-Gothic style with four cylindrical towers, it was surrounded by a [[moat]]. The stone with which it was built (grey granite from the El Bierzo area) is in harmony with its surroundings, particularly with the cathedral in its immediate vicinity, as well as with the natural landscape, which in late 19th-century Astorga was more visible than today. The porch has three large flared arches, built of [[ashlar]] and separated by sloping [[buttress]]es. The structure is supported by columns with decorated capitals and by ribbed vaults on pointed arches, and topped with Mudejar-style merlons. Gaud\u00ed resigned from the project in 1893, at the death of Bishop Grau, due to disagreements with the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]], and it was finished in 1915 by Ricardo Garc\u00eda Guereta. It currently houses a museum about the [[Way of Saint James]], which passes through Astorga.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=150}}\n\nAnother of Gaud\u00ed's projects outside of Catalonia was the [[Casa Botines|Casa de los Botines]], in [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] (1891\u20131894), commissioned by Sim\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez Fern\u00e1ndez and Mariano Andr\u00e9s Luna, textile merchants from Le\u00f3n, who were recommended Gaud\u00ed by Eusebi G\u00fcell, with whom they did business. Gaud\u00ed's project was an impressive neo-Gothic style building, which bears his unmistakable ''modernista'' imprint. The building was used to accommodate offices and textile shops on the lower floors, as well as apartments on the upper floors. It was constructed with walls of solid [[limestone]].{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=37}} The building is flanked by four cylindrical turrets surmounted by slate [[spire]]s, and surrounded by an [[Area (architecture)|area]] with an iron grille. <!--The windows are of guillotine style, with sloped ledges to hold the snow, very common in Leon's winter.--> The Gothic facade style, with its cusped arches, has a clock and a sculpture of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], the work of Lloren\u00e7 Matamala.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=155}} As of 2010 it was the headquarters of the Caja Espa\u00f1a.\n\nIn 1892 Gaud\u00ed was commissioned by Claudio L\u00f3pez Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions for the city of [[Tangier]], in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaud\u00ed conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaud\u00ed deeply regretted the project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, in particular the design of the towers, with their paraboloid shape like those of the Missions.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=333}}\n[[File:Misiones Franciscanas (T\u00e1nger).jpg|thumb|right|Franciscan Mission of Tangiers]]\nIn 1895 he designed a funerary chapel for the G\u00fcell family at the abbey of [[Montserrat Abbey|Montserrat]], but little is known about this work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the [[Bodegas G\u00fcell]], the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi G\u00fcell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 under the direction of Francesc Berenguer, Gaud\u00ed's aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join them to an older building. It has three floors: the bottom one for a garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter's lodge, notable for the iron gate in the shape of a fishing net.\n\nIn the township of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona), the widow of Jaume Figueras commissioned Gaud\u00ed to renovate the Torre Bellesguard (1900\u20131909), former summer palace of [[Martin of Aragon|King Martin I the Humane]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=165}} Gaud\u00ed designed it in a neo-Gothic style, respecting the former building as much as possible, and tried as always to integrate the architecture into the natural surroundings. This influenced his choice of local slate for the construction. The building's ground-plan measures 15 x 15 meters, with the corners oriented to the four cardinal points. Constructed in stone and brick, it is taller than it is wide, with a spire topped with the four-armed cross, the Catalan flag and the royal crown. The house has a basement, ground floor, first floor and an attic, with a gable roof.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=49}}\n\n=== Naturalist period ===\nDuring this period Gaud\u00ed perfected his personal style, inspired by the organic shapes of nature, putting into practise a whole series of new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of [[Ruled surface|ruled geometry]]. To this he added a great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=60}}\n\n==== 1898\u20131900 ====\nCommissioned by the company Hijos de Pedro M\u00e1rtir Calvet, Gaud\u00ed built the [[Casa Calvet]] (1898\u20131899), in Barcelona's Carrer Casp. The facade is built of Montju\u00efc stone, adorned with wrought iron balconies and topped with two pediments with wrought iron crosses. Another notable feature of the facade is the gallery on the main floor, decorated with plant and mythological motifs. For this project, Gaud\u00ed used a Baroque style, visible in the use of Solomonic columns, decoration with floral themes and the design of the terraced roof <!--with cascades and Rococo flowerpot holders-->. In 1900, he won the award for the best building of the year from Barcelona City Council.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001a|p=241}}\n\nA virtually unknown work by Gaud\u00ed is the Casa Clap\u00e9s (1899\u20131900), at 125 Carrer Escorial, commissioned by the painter Aleix Clap\u00e9s, who collaborated on occasion with Gaud\u00ed, such as in decorating the [[Palau G\u00fcell]] and the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]]. It has a ground floor and three apartments, with stuccoed walls and cast-iron balconies. Due to its lack of decoration or original structural solutions its authorship was unknown until 1976, when the architect's signed plans by Gaud\u00ed were discovered.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=375}} In 1900, he renovated the house of Dr. Pere Santal\u00f3, at 32 [[Carrer Nou de la Rambla]], a work of equally low importance. Santal\u00f3 was a friend of Gaud\u00ed's, whom he accompanied during his stay in Puigcerd\u00e0 in 1911.It was he who recommended him to do manual work for his rheumatism.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=272}}\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Naturalist works (1898\u20131900)\n|-\n| [[File:Casa Calvet.jpg|120px]]\n| [[File:Porta Miralles.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Park G\u00fcell 02.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Gaud\u00ed-Rosario Monumental de Montserrat.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Casa Calvet\n| Finca Miralles\n| Park G\u00fcell\n| Rosary of Montserrat\n|}\n\nAlso in 1900, he designed two banners: for the Orfe\u00f3 Feliu\u00e0 (of Sant Feliu de Codines), made of brass, leather, cork and silk, with ornamental motifs based on the martyrdom of San F\u00e9lix (a millstone), music (a staff and clef) and the inscription \"Orfe\u00f3 Feliu\u00e0\"; and [[Banner of Misericordia|Our Lady of Mercy]] of Reus, for the pilgrimage of the Reus residents of Barcelona, with an image of Isabel Besora, the shepherdess to whom the Virgin appeared in 1592, work of Aleix Clap\u00e9s and, on the back, a rose and the Catalan flag. In the same year, for the shrine of Our Lady of Mercy in Reus, Gaud\u00ed outlined a project for the renovation of the church's main facade, which ultimately was not undertaken, as the board considered it too expensive. Gaud\u00ed took this rejection quite badly, leaving some bitterness towards Reus, possibly the source of his subsequent claim that Riudoms was his place of birth.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=425}} Between 1900 and 1902 Gaud\u00ed worked on the Casa Miralles, commissioned by the industrialist Hermenegild Miralles i Angl\u00e8s; Gaud\u00ed designed only the wall near the gateway, of undulating masonry, with an iron gate topped with the four-armed cross. Subsequently, the house for Se\u00f1or Miralles was designed by Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es, associate architect of Gaud\u00ed.\n\nGaud\u00ed's main new project at the beginning of the 20th century was the [[Park G\u00fcell]] (1900\u20131914), commissioned by Eusebi G\u00fcell. It was intended to be a residential estate in the style of an English [[garden city movement|garden city]]. The project was unsuccessful: of the 60 plots into which the site was divided only one was sold. Despite this, the park entrances and service areas were built, displaying Gaud\u00ed's genius and putting into practice many of his innovative structural solutions. The Park G\u00fcell is situated in Barcelona's C\u00e0rmel district, a rugged area, with steep slopes that Gaud\u00ed negotiated with a system of viaducts integrated into the terrain. The main entrance to the park has a building on each side, intended as a porter's lodge and an office, and the site is surrounded by a stone and glazed-ceramic wall. These entrance buildings are an example of Gaud\u00ed at the height of his powers, with Catalan vaults that form a parabolic hyperboloid.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=176}} After passing through the gate, steps lead to higher levels, decorated with sculpted fountains, notably the dragon fountain, which has become a symbol of the park and one of Gaud\u00ed's most recognised emblems. These steps lead to the [[Hypostyle]] Hall, which was to have been the residents' market, constructed with large [[Dorian mode|Doric]] columns. Above this chamber is a large plaza in the form of a Greek theatre, with the famous undulating bench covered in broken ceramics (\"[[trencad\u00eds]]\"), the work of [[Josep Maria Jujol]].{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=150}} The park's show home, the work of Francesc Berenguer, was Gaud\u00ed's residence from 1906 to 1926, and currently houses the [[Gaudi House Museum|Casa-Museu Gaud\u00ed]].\n\nDuring this period Gaud\u00ed contributed to a group project, the Rosary of Montserrat (1900\u20131916). Located on the way to the Holy Cave of Montserrat, it was a series of groups of sculptures that evoked the mysteries of the Virgin, who tells the rosary. This project involved the best architects and sculptors of the era, and is a curious example of Catalan Modernism. Gaud\u00ed designed the First Mystery of Glory, which represents the Holy Sepulcher. The series include a statue of Christ Risen, the work of [[Josep Llimona]], and the Three Marys sculpted by [[Dion\u00eds Renart]]. Another monumental project designed by Gaud\u00ed for Montserrat was never carried out: it would have included crowning the summit of El Cavall Bernat (one of the mountain peaks) with a viewpoint in the shape of a royal crown, incorporating a {{convert|20|m|ft}} high Catalan coat of arms into the wall.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=79}}\n\n==== 1901\u201303 ====\nIn 1901 Gaud\u00ed decorated the house of Isabel G\u00fcell L\u00f3pez, Marchioness of Castelldosrius, and daughter of Eusebi G\u00fcell. Situated at 19 Carrer Junta de Comer\u00e7, the house had been built in 1885 and renovated between 1901 and 1904; it was destroyed by a bomb during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=435}} The following year Gaud\u00ed took part in the decoration of the Bar Torino, property of Flaminio Mezzalana, located at 18 Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia; Gaud\u00ed designed the ornamentation of el Sal\u00f3n \u00c1rabe of that establishment, made with varnished Arabian-style cardboard tiles (which no longer exist).\n\nA project of great interest to Gaud\u00ed was the restoration of the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Palma de Mallorca (1903\u20131914), commissioned by the city's bishop, Pere Campins i Barcel\u00f3. Gaud\u00ed planned a series of works including removing the baroque altarpiece, revealing the bishop's throne, moving the choir-stalls from the centre of the nave and placing them in the presbytery, clearing the way through chapel of the Holy Trinity, placing new pulpits, fitting the cathedral with electrical lighting, uncovering the Gothic windows of the Royal Chapel and filling them with stained glass, placing a large canopy above the main altar and completing the decoration with paintings. This was coordinated by Joan Rubi\u00f3 i Bellver, Gaud\u00ed's assistant. Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda, Iu Pascual and Jaume Llongueras were also involved. Gaud\u00ed abandoned the project in 1914 due to disagreements with the Cathedral chapter.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=221}}\n\n==== 1904 ====\n[[File:Casabatllo2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Casa Batll\u00f3]]]]\nAmong Gaud\u00ed's largest and most striking works is the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] (1904\u20131906). Commissioned by Josep Batll\u00f3 i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cort\u00e9s,{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=184}} Gaud\u00ed focused on the fa\u00e7ade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es, Joan Rubi\u00f3 and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montju\u00efc sandstone cut to create warped [[ruled surface]]s; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaud\u00ed kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies\u2014with iron railings in the shape of masks\u2014giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours (\"trencad\u00eds\"), which Gaud\u00ed obtained from the waste material of the Pelegr\u00ed glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure in the shape of a double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaud\u00ed's four-armed cross.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=187}}\n\nIn 1904, commissioned by the painter [[Llu\u00eds Graner]], he designed the decoration of the Sala Merc\u00e8, in the [[Rambla dels Estudis]], one of the first cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and the main gate were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to the Casa Batll\u00f3 or the porter's lodge of the Park G\u00fcell.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=471}}\n\n[[File:Chalet Catllar\u00e0s (1905)B2.jpg|thumb|left|El chalet de Catllar\u00e0s (1905), in [[La Pobla de Lillet]]]]\nThe same year he built a workshop, the Taller Badia, for Josep and Llu\u00eds Badia Miarnau,\nblacksmiths who worked for Gaud\u00ed on several of his works, such as the Batll\u00f3 and Mil\u00e0 houses, the Park G\u00fcell and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Located at 278 Carrer N\u00e0pols, it was a simple stone building. Around that time he also designed hexagonal [[Cement tile|hydraulic floor tiles]] for the Casa Batll\u00f3, they were eventually used instead for the Casa Mil\u00e0; they were a green colour and were decorated with seaweed, shells and starfish. These tiles were subsequently chosen to pave Barcelona's Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Gaud\u00ed i els seus co\u0140laboradors: artistes i industrials a l'entorn del 1900|p=271}}\n\nAlso in 1904 he built the Chalet de Catllar\u00e0s, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi G\u00fcell. It has a simple structure though very original, in the shape of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one.<!--<ref>http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AA020%20Catllaras%20Villa.htm</ref> --> In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park G\u00fcell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=469}}\n\n==== 1906 ====\n[[File:Lillet21.jpg|thumb|[[Artigas Gardens]], in [[La Pobla de Lillet]]]]\nIn 1906 he designed a bridge over the Torrent de Pomeret, between Sarri\u00e0 and Sant Gervasi. This river flowed directly between two of Gaud\u00ed's works, Bellesguard and the Chalet Graner, and so he was asked to bridge the divide. Gaud\u00ed designed an interesting structure composed of juxtaposed triangles that would support the bridge's framework, following the style of the viaducts that he made for the Park G\u00fcell. It would have been built with cement, and would have had a length of {{convert|154|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|15|m|ft}}; the balustrade would have been covered with glazed tiles, with an inscription dedicated to Santa Eul\u00e0lia. The project was not approved by the Town Council of Sarri\u00e0.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=214}}\n\nThe same year Gaud\u00ed apparently took part in the construction of the {{interlanguage link|Torre Mateu|es|lt=Torre Dami\u00e0 Mateu, in Llinars del Vall\u00e8s}}, in collaboration with his disciple Francesc Berenguer, though the project's authorship is not clear or to what extent they each contributed to it. The style of the building evokes Gaud\u00ed's early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the G\u00fcell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate in the shape of a fishing net, currently installed in the Park G\u00fcell. The building was demolished in 1939.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=507}} Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of metalworkers and blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona's coat of arms in the upper left corner, and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical tools of the trade. The banner was burned in July 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=509}}\n\n[[File:Casa Mil\u00e0, general view.jpg|thumb|[[Casa Mil\u00e0 (La Pedrera)]]]]\n\nAnother of Gaud\u00ed's major projects and among his most admired works is the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]], better known as La Pedrera (1906\u20131910), commissioned by Pere Mil\u00e0 i Camps. Gaud\u00ed designed the house around two large, curved courtyards, with a structure of stone, brick and cast-iron columns and steel beams. The facade is built of limestone from Vilafranca del Pened\u00e8s, apart from the upper level, which is covered in white tiles, evoking a snowy mountain. It has a total of five floors, plus a loft made entirely of catenary arches, as well as two large interior courtyards, one circular and one oval. Notable features are the staircases to the roof, topped with the four-armed cross, and the chimneys, covered in ceramics and with shapes that suggest mediaeval helmets. The interior decoration was carried out by Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogu\u00e9s and Aleix Clap\u00e9s. The facade was to have been completed with a stone, metal and glass sculpture with Our lady of the Rosary accompanied by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, 4&nbsp;m in height. A sketch was made by the sculptor Carles Mani, but due to the events of the Tragic Week in 1909 the project was abandoned.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001a|p=296}}\n\n==== 1907\u201308 ====\nIn 1907, to mark the seventh centenary of the birth of [[James I of Aragon|King James I]], Gaud\u00ed designed a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Pla\u00e7a del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa \u00c0gada, dedicated to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next to the walls (now the Pla\u00e7a Ramon Berenguer el Grand). The project was not executed because the city council disliked it.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=529}}\n\nIn 1908 Gaud\u00ed devised a project for a skyscraper hotel in New York City, the [[Hotel Attraction]], commissioned by two American entrepreneurs whose names are unknown. It would have been {{convert|360|m|ft}} high (taller than the [[Empire State Building]]), with a taller parabolic central section, topped with a star, and flanked by four volumes containing museums, art galleries and concert halls, with shapes similar to the Casa Mil\u00e0. Inside it would have had five large rooms, one dedicated to every continent.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=531}}\n\n[[File:Proyecto original Colonia G\u00fcell.jpg|thumb|upright|Original design of the church for the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]]\n\nThe final project for his great patron Eusebi G\u00fcell was the church for the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell, an industrial village in Santa Coloma de Cervell\u00f3 (1890\u20131918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What would have been the colony's church was designed by Gaud\u00ed in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the crypt (known today as Crypt of the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell) was built, as G\u00fcell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaud\u00ed designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes the crypt, the first time that Gaud\u00ed used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=370}} In the crypt the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.\n\n=== Final period ===\n[[File:SF - Escuelas.jpg|thumb|Sagrada Familia schools]]\nDuring the last years of his career, dedicated almost exclusively to the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]], Gaud\u00ed reached the culmination of this naturalistic style, creating a synthesis of all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then. Gaud\u00ed achieved perfect harmony between structural and ornamental elements, between plastic and aesthetic, between function and form, between container and content, achieving the integration of all arts in one structured, logical work.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=68}}\n\nThe first example of his final stage can be seen in a simple but very ingenious building, the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia schools]], a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a rectangular ground plan of {{convert|10|x|20|m|ft}}, and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Fam\u00edlia schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as a source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=79}}\n\nIn May 1910 Gaud\u00ed paid a short visit to Vic, where he was tasked to design the lampposts for the city's Pla\u00e7a Major, in commemoration of the first centenary of the birth of [[Jaume Balmes]]. They were obelisk-shaped lamps, with basalt rock bases from Castellfollit de la Roca and wrought iron arms, topped with the four-armed cross; they were decorated with vegetable themes and included the birth and death dates of Balmes. They were demolished in 1924 due to poor maintenance.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=555}}\n\nThe same year, on the occasion of Eusebi G\u00fcell's obtaining the title of count, Gaud\u00ed designed a coat of arms for his patron. He devised a shield with the lower part in a catenary shape typical of Gaud\u00ed. He divided it into two parts: the lantern of Palau G\u00fcell features a dove and a gear-wheel on the right in allusion to the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell in Santa Coloma de Cervell\u00f3 (''coloma'' is Catalan for dove), with the phrase ''ahir pastor'' (yesterday Shepherd). On the left is an owl perched on a half-moon\u2014symbol of prudence and wisdom\u2014with the words ''avuy senyor'' (today Lord). The shield is surmounted by a helmet with the count's coronet and the dove symbol of the Holy Spirit.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=49}}\n\nIn 1912 he built two [[pulpit]]s for the church of Santa Maria in [[Blanes]]: the pulpit on the [[Gospel side]] had a hexagonal base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the [[Epistle side]] had the names of the apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=495}}<!-- For the restoration of the Cathedral of Manresa, Gaud\u00ed was asked in 1915 to conduct a preliminary assessment by the architect Alexandre Soler i March, in charge of the works. Gaud\u00ed suggested some corrections, such as placing a hall next to the baptistery, a gabled roof over the main hall and a room above the hall for a museum and archive.-->\n\n==== Sagrada Fam\u00edlia ====\n[[File:SF - lago.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia|Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]]]]\n{{Main|Sagrada Fam\u00edlia}}\nFrom 1915 Gaud\u00ed devoted himself almost exclusively to his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the [[crypt]] and the [[apse]], still in Gothic style, the rest of the church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of [[ruled surface]]s. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaud\u00ed applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park G\u00fcell and the crypt of the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.\n\nThe Sagrada Fam\u00edlia has a cruciform plan, with a five-aisled nave, a transept of three aisles, and an apse with seven chapels. It has three facades dedicated to the birth, passion and glory of Jesus, and when completed it will have eighteen towers: four at each side making a total of twelve for the apostles, four on the transept invoking the evangelists and one on the apse dedicated to the Virgin, plus the central tower in honour of Jesus, which will reach {{convert|172.5|m|ft}} in height.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=198}} The church will have two [[sacristy|sacristies]] adjacent to the apse, and three large chapels: one for the Assumption in the apse, and the Baptism and Penitence chapels at the west end; also, it will be surrounded by a cloister designed for processions and to isolate the building from the exterior. Gaud\u00ed used highly symbolic content in the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, both in architecture and sculpture, dedicating each part of the church to a religious theme.\n\nDuring Gaud\u00ed's life only the crypt, apse and part of the Nativity facade were completed. Upon his death his assistant Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es took over the construction; thereafter it was directed by various architects.

Artists such as Lloren\u00e7 and Joan Matamala, Carles Mani, Jaume Busquets, Joaquim Ros i Bofarull, Etsuro Sotoo and Josep Maria Subirachs (creator of the Passion facade) have worked on the sculptural decoration.

He made a sketch of the project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaud\u00ed. It was put in the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=563}} Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellter\u00e7ol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped with an iron structure flying the Catalan flag. The sketch of the project was done by Llu\u00eds Bonet i Gar\u00ed, Gaud\u00ed's assistant.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=565}}\n\nIn 1922 Gaud\u00ed was commissioned, by the Franciscan Padre Ang\u00e9lico Aranda, to construct a church dedicated to the Assumption in the Chilean city of [[Rancagua]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=581}} Gaud\u00ed apologised and said that he was occupied exclusively with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, but sent some sketches of the Assumption chapel which he had designed for the apse of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which more or less coincided with what Padre Aranda had asked for. Unfortunately this project was not carried out, though there are currently plans by the Chilean architect [[Christian Matzner]] to take up the project. The [[President of Chile]], [[Michelle Bachelet]], has announced that building will begin in 2015, with an expected completion in 2017 and at a cost of [[US dollar|$]]7&nbsp;million. Once completed it will become the first of Gaud\u00ed's works to be constructed in the Americas.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001b|p=47}}<ref>{{cite news | first = Ashifa | last = Kassam | title = Chile's Gaudi plan gets off the drawing board | work = The Guardian | date = 17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe same year Gaud\u00ed was consulted about the construction of a monumental train station for Barcelona (the future [[Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a]]). Gaud\u00ed suggested an iron structure in the form of a large suspended awning, a solution quite ahead of its time; perhaps for this reason, it put the head engineers off, and they declined Gaud\u00ed's offer. The last known projects by the architect are the chapel for the Col\u00f3nia Calvet in Torell\u00f3, of 1923, and a pulpit for Valencia (the exact location is unknown), of 1924. From then on, Gaud\u00ed worked exclusively on the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia until his death.\n\n== Collaborators ==\nThe enormous task which Gaud\u00ed faced, not in terms of the number of works, but in terms of their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen. Gaud\u00ed always led the way, but allowed expression of the individual abilities of all of his collaborators. A test of his expertise both in his field and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Collaboradors.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128182400/http://gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Collaboradors.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |title=Colaboradores de Gaud\u00ed |accessdate=3 August 2008 |work=Gaudiallgaudi.com |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\nAmong his collaborators were:\n* Architects: Francesc Berenguer, Josep Maria Jujol, Crist\u00f2for Cascante i Colom, Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols, C\u00e8sar Martinell, Joan Berg\u00f3s, Francesc Folguera, Josep Canaleta, Joan Rubi\u00f3, Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es, Francesc Quintana, Isidre Puig i Boada, Llu\u00eds Bonet i Gar\u00ed.\n* Sculptors: Carles Mani, Joan Flotats, Lloren\u00e7 Matamala, Joan Matamala, Josep Llimona.\n* Painters: Ricard Opisso, Aleix Clap\u00e9s, Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogu\u00e9s, Jaume Llongueras, Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda.\n* Builders and foremen: Agust\u00ed Massip, Josep Bay\u00f3 i Font, Claudi Alsina i Bonafont, Josep Pardo i Casanova and his nephew Juli\u00e0 Bardier i Pardo.\n* Craftsmen: Eudald Punt\u00ed (carpenter and forger), Joan O\u00f1\u00f3s (forger), Llu\u00eds y Josep Badia i Miarnau (forger), Joan Bertran (plasterer), Joan Munn\u00e9 (cabinet maker), Frederic Lab\u00f2ria (cabinet maker), Antoni Rigalt i Blanch (glazier), Josep Pelegr\u00ed (glazier), Mario Maragliano (mosaic artist), Jaume Pujol i Bausis and his son Pau Pujol i Vil\u00e0 (ceramicists).\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nGaud\u00ed was run down by a streetcar, and died in 1926. He is buried in the Sagrada Familia. After his death, Gaud\u00ed's works suffered a period of neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by ''[[Noucentisme]]'', the new movement which took the place of ''Modernisme''. In 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], Gaud\u00ed's workshop in the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia was ransacked, and a great number of his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.\n\nGaud\u00ed's reputation was beginning to recover by the 1950s, when his work was championed not only by [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] but also by architect [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]]. In 1952, the centenary year of the architect's birth, the Asociaci\u00f3n de Amigos de Gaud\u00ed (Friends of Gaud\u00ed Association) was founded with the aim of disseminating and conserving his legacy. Four years later, a retrospective was organised at the [[Palau Reial Major|Sal\u00f3 del Tinell]] in Barcelona, and the Gaud\u00ed Chair at the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]] was created with the purpose of deepening the study of the Gaud\u00ed's works and participating in their conservation. These events were followed in 1957 by Gaud\u00ed's first international exhibition, held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. In 1976, on the 50th anniversary of his death, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs organised an exhibition about Gaud\u00ed and his works that toured the globe.<ref name=\"Cerv\">{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/gaudi/bassegoda.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709074728/http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/gaudi/bassegoda.htm |archivedate=9 July 2012 |title=Antoni Gaud\u00ed Cornet (1852\u20131926) |accessdate=3 August 2008 |last=Bassegoda |first=Juan |work=Instituto Cervantes |language=Spanish |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1960, research and writings by international critics like George R. Collins, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] and Roberto Pane spread a renewed awareness of Gaud\u00ed's work, while in his homeland it was admired and promoted by Alexandre Cirici, [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]] and [[Oriol Bohigas]]. Gaud\u00ed's work has since gained widespread international appreciation, such as in Japan where notable studies have been published by [[Hiroya Tanka Architect|Dr. Hiroya Tanaka (Gaudi Prize winner)]], [[Kenji Imai (architect)|Kenji Imai]] and [[Tokutoshi Torii]]. International recognition of Gaud\u00ed's contributions to the field of architecture and design culminated in the 1984 listing of Gaud\u00ed's key works as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=9}} Gaud\u00ed's style have subsequently influenced contemporary architects such as [[Santiago Calatrava]]<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Gaud\u00ed effect |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jan/16/architecture.spain |newspaper=([[The Guardian]]) |date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> and [[Norman Foster]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Gaudi Mania |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,216477,00.html |work=Time Magazine |date=11 March 2002 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nGaud\u00ed was the subject of the 1984 documentary ''[[Antonio Gaudi (film)|Antonio Gaudi]]''.\n\nDue to Gaud\u00ed's profoundly religious and [[ascetic]] lifestyle, the archbishop of Barcelona, Ricard Maria Carles proposed Gaud\u00ed's [[beatification]] in 1998. In 1999, American composer [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]] wrote the guitar concerto ''[[Concert de Gaud\u00ed]]'', which was inspired by Gaud\u00ed's work; it went on to win the [[44th Annual Grammy Awards|2002]] [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition|Best Classical Contemporary Composition]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Sheridan |first=Molly |title=A Rousing Night at the Grammy Awards |work=[[NewMusicBox]] |date=28 February 2002 |url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/A-Rousing-Night-at-the-Grammy-Awards/ |accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Gaud\u00ed's birth, a number of official ceremonies, concerts, shows and conferences were held, and several books were published.

He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as ''[[trencad\u00eds]]'' which used waste ceramic pieces.\n\nUnder the influence of [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic art]] and Oriental techniques, Gaud\u00ed became part of the ''Modernista'' movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream ''Modernisme'', culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms.

Gaud\u00ed's family originated in the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne region]] in southern France. One of his ancestors, Joan Gaud\u00ed, a hawker, moved to Catalonia in the 17th century; possible origins of Gaud\u00ed's family name include Gaudy or Gaudin.{{sfn|Castellar-Gassol|1999|p=13}}\n[[File:Mas calderera.jpg|thumb|right|El Mas de la Calderera, home of the Gaud\u00ed family in [[Riudoms]]]]\nGaud\u00ed's exact birthplace is unknown because no supporting documents have been found, leading to a controversy about whether he was born in Reus or Riudoms, two neighbouring municipalities of the [[Baix Camp]] district.

Gaud\u00ed stated on various occasions that he was born in Riudoms, his paternal family's village.<ref>Throughout the early part of his life Gaud\u00ed named Reus as his birthplace in all his identity documents, but beginning in 1915 he declared himself Riudoms-born.

He believed Mediterranean people to be endowed with creativity, originality and an innate sense for art and design. Gaud\u00ed reportedly described this distinction by stating, \"We own the image.

[[Orestes]] knows his way, where [[Hamlet]] is torn apart by his doubts.\"{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=26}} Time spent outdoors, particularly during summer stays in the Gaud\u00ed family home Mas de la Calderera, afforded Gaud\u00ed the opportunity to study nature. Gaud\u00ed's enjoyment of the natural world led him to join the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya in 1879 at the age of 27. The organisation arranged expeditions to explore Catalonia and southern France, often riding on horseback or walking ten kilometres a day.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=31}}\n[[File:Gaud\u00ed en Montserrat (1904).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaud\u00ed (in the background) with his father (centre), his niece Rosa and doctor Santal\u00f3 during a visit to [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] (1904)]]\nYoung Gaud\u00ed suffered from poor health, including [[rheumatism]], which may have contributed to his reticent and reserved character.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=36}} These health concerns and the hygienist theories of Dr. [[Sebastian Kneipp|Kneipp]]{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=162}} contributed to Gaud\u00ed's decision to adopt [[vegetarianism]] early in his life.{{sfn|Stone|2011}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Metello |first=Nuno |title=History of Vegetarianism\u2014Antoni Gaud\u00ed (1852\u20131926) |work=International Vegetarian Union |year=2008 |url=http://www.ivu.org/history/europe20a/gaudi.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813021134/http://www.ivu.org/history/europe20a/gaudi.html |archivedate=13 August 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> His religious faith and strict vegetarianism led him to undertake several lengthy and severe [[fasting|fasts]].

He gained wider recognition for his first important commission, the [[Casa Vicens]], and subsequently received more significant proposals. At the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World's Fair of 1878]] Gaud\u00ed displayed a showcase he had produced for the glove manufacturer Comella. Its functional and aesthetic ''modernista'' design impressed Catalan industrialist Eusebi G\u00fcell, who then commissioned some of Gaud\u00ed's most outstanding work: the [[Bodegas G\u00fcell|G\u00fcell wine cellars]], the G\u00fcell pavilions, the [[Palau G\u00fcell]] (G\u00fcell palace), the [[Park G\u00fcell]] (G\u00fcell park) and the crypt of the church of the [[Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]]. Gaud\u00ed also became a friend of the marquis of Comillas, the father-in-law of Count G\u00fcell, for whom he designed \"[[El Capricho]]\" in [[Comillas]].\n\nIn 1883 Gaud\u00ed was put in charge of the recently initiated project to build a Barcelona church called [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia|Bas\u00edlica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] (Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family, or Sagrada Fam\u00edlia). Gaud\u00ed completely changed the initial design and imbued it with his own distinctive style. From 1915 until his death he devoted himself entirely to this project. Given the number of commissions he began receiving, he had to rely on his team to work on multiple projects simultaneously. His team consisted of professionals from all fields of construction. Several of the architects who worked under him became prominent in the field later on, such as [[Josep Maria Jujol]], [[Joan Rubi\u00f3]], [[C\u00e8sar Martinell]], Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols. In 1885, Gaud\u00ed moved to rural [[Sant Feliu de Codines]] to escape the [[cholera]] epidemic that was ravaging Barcelona. He lived in Francesc Ullar's house, for whom he designed a dinner table as a sign of his gratitude.{{sfn|Tarragona|1999|p=22}}\n\n[[File:Carnet Gaud\u00ed (1888).jpg|thumb|left|Gaud\u00ed's exposition licence at the [[Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona]], 1888]]\n\nThe [[Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona|1888 World Fair]] was one of the era's major events in Barcelona and represented a key point in the history of the ''Modernisme'' movement. Leading architects displayed their best works, including Gaud\u00ed, who showcased the building he had designed for the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Trasatl\u00e1ntica (Transatlantic Company). Consequently, he received a commission to restructure the Sal\u00f3 de Cent of the Barcelona City Council, but this project was ultimately not carried out. In the early 1890s Gaud\u00ed received two commissions from outside of Catalonia, namely the [[Episcopal Palace, Astorga]], and the [[Casa Botines]] in [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]]. These works contributed to Gaud\u00ed's growing renown across Spain.

They reflected his shift to a more personal style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his [[Casa Calvet]]. During the first decade of the century Gaud\u00ed dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as [[Bellesguard]]), the [[Park G\u00fcell]], an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] (Batll\u00f3 house) and the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]] (Mil\u00e1 house), two of his most emblematic works.\n\n[[File:Joan Llimona - San Felipe Neri en la consagraci\u00f3n de la Santa Misa.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Philip Neri celebrating the Holy Mass'' by Joan Llimona (church of Sant Felip Neri, Barcelona).

Finally, in 1906, he settled in a house in the G\u00fcell Park that he owned and which had been constructed by his assistant Francesc Berenguer as a showcase property for the estate. It has since been transformed into the Gaud\u00ed Museum. There he lived with his father (who died in 1906 at the age of 93) and his niece Rosa Egea Gaud\u00ed (who died in 1912 at the age of 36). He lived in the house until 1925, several months before his death, when he began residing inside the workshop of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.\n\nAn event that had a profound impact on Gaud\u00ed's personality was [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in 1909. Gaud\u00ed remained in his house in G\u00fcell Park during this turbulent period. The anticlerical atmosphere and attacks on churches and convents caused Gaud\u00ed to worry for the safety of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, but the building escaped damage.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=250}}\n\nIn 1910, an exhibition in the [[Grand Palais]] of Paris was devoted to his work, during the annual salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France. Gaud\u00ed participated on the invitation of count G\u00fcell, displaying a series of pictures, plans and plaster scale models of several of his works. Although he participated ''hors concours'', he received good reviews from the French press. A large part of this exposition could be seen the following year at the I Sal\u00f3n Nacional de Arquitectura that took place in the municipal exhibition hall of [[El Buen Retiro]] in Madrid.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=551}}\n\nDuring the Paris exposition in May 1910, Gaud\u00ed spent a holiday in [[Vic]], where he designed two [[basalt]] lampposts and wrought iron for the Pla\u00e7a Major of Vic in honor of [[Jaume Balmes]]'s centenary. The following year he resided as a convalescent in [[Puigcerd\u00e0]] while suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. During this time he conceived the idea for the facade of the Passion of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.{{sfn|Puig i Boada|1986|p=166}} Due to ill health he prepared a [[will (law)|will]] at the office of the notary Ramon Cant\u00f3 i Figueres on 9 June, but later completely recovered.{{sfn|Tarragona|1999|p=239}}\n\nThe decade from 1910 was a hard one for Gaud\u00ed. During this decade, the architect experienced the deaths of his niece Rosa in 1912 and his main collaborator Francesc Berenguer in 1914; a severe economic crisis which paralysed work on the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in 1915; the 1916 death of his friend Josep Torras i Bages, bishop of Vic; the 1917 disruption of work at the Colonia G\u00fcell; and the 1918 death of his friend and patron Eusebi G\u00fcell.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=291}} Perhaps because of these tragedies he devoted himself entirely to the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia from 1915, taking refuge in his work. Gaud\u00ed confessed to his collaborators:\n\n{{quote|My good friends are dead; I have no family and no clients, no fortune nor anything. Now I can dedicate myself entirely to the Church.{{sfn|Bonet i Armengol|2001|p=21}}}}\n\nGaud\u00ed dedicated the last years of his life entirely to the \"Cathedral of the Poor\", as it was commonly known, for which he took [[alms]] in order to continue. Apart from his dedication to this cause, he participated in few other activities, the majority of which were related to his Catholic faith: in 1916 he participated in a course about [[Gregorian chant]] at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]] taught by the [[Benedictine]] monk Gregori M. Sunyol.{{sfn|Tarragona|1999|p=164}}\n\nIn 1936, during the course of the [[Spanish Civil War]], Gaud\u00ed's workshop in the [[Sagrada Familia]] was assaulted, destroying a large number of documents, plans and models of the modernist architect.\n\n=== Personal life ===\nGaud\u00ed devoted his life entirely to his profession, remaining single.

As a young man, he dressed like a [[dandy]] in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging [[gourmet]] taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaud\u00ed ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a [[beggar]], such as after the accident that caused his death.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=13}}\n\nGaud\u00ed left hardly any written documents, apart from technical reports of his works required by official authorities, some letters to friends (particularly to Joan Maragall) and a few journal articles. Some quotes collected by his assistants and disciples have been preserved, above all by Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols, Joan Berg\u00f3s, [[C\u00e8sar Martinell]] and Isidre Puig i Boada. The only written document Gaud\u00ed left is known as the Manuscrito de Reus (Reus Manuscript) (1873\u20131878), a kind of student diary in which he collected diverse impressions of architecture and decorating, putting forward his ideas on the subject. Included are an analysis of the Christian church and of his ancestral home, as well as a text about ornamentation and comments on the design of a desk.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=29}}\n\nGaud\u00ed was always in favour of Catalan culture but was reluctant to become politically active to campaign for its autonomy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Jeremy|title=Antoni Gaud\u00ed|year=2012|publisher=Parkstone International|isbn=978-1-78042-967-0|page=25}}</ref> Politicians, such as [[Francesc Camb\u00f3]] and [[Enric Prat de la Riba]], suggested that he run for [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|deputy]] but he refused.

Eventually some passers-by transported him in a taxi to the [[Hospital de la Santa Creu|Santa Creu Hospital]], where he received rudimentary care.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=263}}\n\nBy the time that the chaplain of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Mos\u00e9n Gil Par\u00e9s, recognised him on the following day, Gaud\u00ed's condition had deteriorated too severely to benefit from additional treatment. Gaud\u00ed died on 10 June 1926 at the age of 73 and was buried two days later. A large crowd gathered to bid farewell to him in the chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the crypt of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. His gravestone bears this inscription:\n<blockquote>Antonius Gaud\u00ed Cornet. Reusensis. Annos natus LXXIV, vitae exemplaris vir, eximiusque artifex, mirabilis operis hujus, templi auctor, pie obiit Barcinone die X Junii MCMXXVI, hinc cineres tanti hominis, resurrectionem mortuorum expectant.

May he rest in peace.)</blockquote>\n\n== Style ==\n\n=== Gaud\u00ed and ''Modernisme'' ===\n[[File:Cruz cuatro brazos.jpg|thumb|Traditional Gothic ''cross flower'' reinterpreted, one of the most typical features of Gaud\u00ed's works]]\n\nGaud\u00ed's professional life was distinctive in that he never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaud\u00ed was inspired by oriental arts ([[India]], [[Persia]], [[Japan]]) through the study of the [[Historicism|historicist]] architectural theoreticians, such as [[Walter Pater]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[William Morris]]. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the G\u00fcell Palace, the G\u00fcell Pavilions and the [[Casa Vicens]]. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house as well as in the crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Eventually, Gaud\u00ed embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.\n\nDuring his time as a student, Gaud\u00ed was able to study a collection of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included [[Moorish]] monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book ''Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra'' by [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], which he borrowed from the School's library.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=114}} He took various structural and ornamental solutions from [[nazar\u00ed]] and [[mud\u00e9jar]] art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaud\u00ed observed of [[Islamic art]] its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the feeling of open space by enclosing it with barriers.{{sfn|Flores|2002|p=58}}\n\nUndoubtedly the style that most influenced him was the [[Gothic Revival]], promoted in the latter half of the 19th century by the theoretical works of [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. The French architect called for studying the styles of the past and adapting them in a rational manner, taking into account both structure and design.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Els anys d'aprenentatge de Gaud\u00ed|p=44}} Nonetheless, for Gaud\u00ed the Gothic style was \"imperfect\", because despite the effectiveness of some of its structural solutions it was an art that had yet to be \"perfected\". In his own words:\n\n{{quote|text=Gothic art is imperfect, only half resolved; it is a style created by the compasses, a formulaic industrial repetition. Its stability depends on constant propping up by the buttresses: it is a defective body held up on crutches. (...) The proof that Gothic works are of deficient plasticity is that they produce their greatest emotional effect when they are mutilated, covered in ivy and lit by the moon.{{sfn|Flores|2002|p=89}}}}\n\n[[File:Reptil Parc Guell Barcelona.jpg|thumb|The salamander in [[Park G\u00fcell]] has become a symbol of Gaud\u00ed's work.]]\n\nAfter these initial influences, Gaud\u00ed moved towards ''Modernisme'', then in its heyday. ''Modernisme'' in its earlier stages was inspired by historic architecture. Its practitioners saw its return to the past as a response to the industrial forms imposed by the [[Industrial Revolution]]'s technological advances. The use of these older styles represented a moral regeneration that allowed the [[bourgeoisie]] to identify with values they regarded as their cultural roots. The ''[[Renaixen\u00e7a]]'' (rebirth), the revival of Catalan culture that began in the second half of the 19th century, brought more Gothic forms into the Catalan \"national\" style that aimed to combine nationalism and cosmopolitanism while at the same time integrating into the European modernizing movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc42.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120103813/http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc42.htm |archivedate=20 January 2012 |title=El vanguardismo de un tradicionalista |accessdate=3 August 2008 |last=Fontbona |first=Francesc |work=Barcelona Metropolis Mediterranea |language=Spanish |date=July 2002 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nSome essential features of ''Modernisme'' were: an anticlassical language inherited from [[Romanticism]] with a tendency to lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; a strong sense of optimism and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.{{sfn|Flores|2002|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n=== Quest for a new architectural language ===\nGaud\u00ed is usually considered the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any one style or classification. They are imaginative works that find their main inspiration in nature. Gaud\u00ed studied organic and [[anarchy|anarchic]] geometric forms of nature thoroughly, searching for a way to give expression to these forms in architecture. Some of his greatest inspirations came from visits to the mountain of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], the caves of [[Mallorca]], the [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] caves in [[Collbat\u00f3]], the crag of Fra Guerau in the [[Prades Mountains]] behind Reus, the Pareis mountain in the north of Mallorca and [[Sant Miquel del Fai]] in Bigues i Riells.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=198}}\n\n==== Geometrical forms ====\n[[File:Sagrada Familia nave roof detail.jpg|thumb|The nave in the Sagrada Familia with a [[hyperboloid]] [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]. Inspiration from nature is taken from a tree, as the pillar and branches symbolise trees rising up to the roof.]]\nThis study of nature translated into his use of [[Ruled surface|ruled geometrical forms]] such as the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], the [[hyperboloid]], the [[helicoid]] and the [[cone (geometry)|cone]], which reflect the forms Gaud\u00ed found in nature.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=266}} Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the [[generatrix]], as it moves over one or several lines known as [[Directrix (conic section)|directrices]]. Gaud\u00ed found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[reed (plant)|reeds]] and [[bone]]s; he used to say that there is no better structure than the trunk of a tree or a [[human skeleton]]. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaud\u00ed discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture. He used to equate the [[helicoid]] form to movement and the [[hyperboloid]] to light. Concerning ruled surfaces, he said:\n\n{{quote|text=Paraboloids, hyperboloids and helicoids, constantly varying the incidence of the light, are rich in matrices themselves, which make ornamentation and even modelling unnecessary.{{sfn|Puig i Boada|2004|p=238}}}}\n\nAnother element widely used by Gaud\u00ed was the [[catenary arch]]. He had studied [[geometry]] thoroughly when he was young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised the virtues of the catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of [[suspension bridge]]s. Gaud\u00ed was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]], the Teresian College, the crypt of the [[Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]] and the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] allowed Gaud\u00ed to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling [[tangential]] forces.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Apunts sobre la intu\u00efci\u00f3 cient\u00edfica de Gaud\u00ed|p=168}}\n\nGaud\u00ed evolved from [[plane (geometry)|plane]] to [[spatial geometry]], to [[ruled surface|ruled geometry]]. These constructional forms are highly suited to the use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaud\u00ed frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional [[Catalan vault]], using the brick laid flat instead of on its side.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=12}} This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research and experience in his masterpiece, the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]]. Gaud\u00ed conceived the interior of the church as if it were a forest, with a set of tree-like [[columns]] divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid [[vault (architecture)|vaults]]. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn helicoidal shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created a structure that is now known as [[fractal]].{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Gaud\u00ed: geometria, estructura i construcci\u00f3|p=144}} Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for [[buttresses]], as required by the neo-Gothic style.{{sfn|Flores|2002|pp=91\u201392}} Gaud\u00ed thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.\n\n==== Surpassing the Gothic ====\nThis new constructional technique allowed Gaud\u00ed to achieve his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their center where Gothic vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between vaults, where Gothic vaults have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaud\u00ed employed to give the impression of a starry sky.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Tecnica%20arq.htm |work=Gaudiallgaudi.com |language=Spanish |archivedate=29 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929122133/http://gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Tecnica%20arq.htm |title=T\u00e9cnica arquitect\u00f3nica de Gaud\u00ed |accessdate=3 August 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nGaud\u00ed complemented this organic vision of architecture with a unique spatial vision that allowed him to conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=16}} Because of this spatial conception, Gaud\u00ed always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works\u2014in fact, only when required by authorities.\n\n[[File:Maqueta funicular.jpg|thumb|left|An upside-down force model of the [[Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]], Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Museum]]\n\nAnother of Gaud\u00ed's innovations in the technical realm was the use of a scale model to calculate structures: for the church of the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell, he built a 1:10 scale model with a height of {{convert|4|m}} in a shed next to the building. There, he set up a model that had strings with small bags full of [[birdshot]] hanging from them. On a drawing board that was attached to the ceiling he drew the floor of the church, and he hung the strings (for the catenaries) with the birdshot (for the weight) from the supporting points of the building\u2014columns, intersection of walls. These weights produced a catenary curve in both the arches and vaults. At that point, he took a picture that, when inverted, showed the structure for columns and arches that Gaud\u00ed was looking for. Gaud\u00ed then painted over these photographs with [[gouache]] or [[pastel]]. The outline of the church defined, he recorded every single detail of the building: architectural, stylistic and decorative.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nGaud\u00ed's position in the history of architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaud\u00ed's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from [[Dorian mode|Doric]] to [[Baroque]] via [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaud\u00ed passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the [[Bauhaus]] school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaud\u00ed, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the ''modernista'' architect.\n\nAmong other factors that led to the initial neglect of the Catalan architect's work was that despite having numerous assistants and helpers, Gaud\u00ed created no school of his own and never taught, nor did he leave written documents. Some of his subordinates adopted his innovations, above all Francesc Berenguer and [[Josep Maria Jujol]]; others, like [[C\u00e8sar Martinell]], Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols graduated towards [[Noucentisme]], leaving the master's trail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc65.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120181510/http://www.bcn.es/publicacions/b_mm/ebmm58/bmm58_qc65.htm |archivedate=20 January 2012 |title=Dise\u00f1o: entre el legado y la invenci\u00f3n de la tradici\u00f3n |accessdate=3 August 2008 |last=Pibernat |first=Oriol |language=Spanish |work=Barcelona Metropolis Mediterranea |date=July 2002 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Despite this, a degree of influence can be discerned in some architects that either formed part of the ''Modernista'' movement or departed from it and who had had no direct contact with him, such as Josep Maria Pericas (Casa Al\u00f2s, [[Ripoll]]), Bernard\u00ed Martorell ([[Olius]] cemetery) and Llu\u00eds Muncunill (Masia Freixa, [[Terrassa]]). Nonetheless, Gaud\u00ed left a deep mark on 20th-century architecture: masters like [[Le Corbusier]] declared themselves admirers, and the works of other architects like [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[F\u00e9lix Candela]], [[Eduardo Torroja]] and [[Santiago Calatrava]] were inspired by Gaud\u00ed. [[Frei Otto]] used Gaud\u00ed's forms in the construction of the [[Munich Olympic Stadium]]. In Japan, the work of [[Kenji Imai (architect)|Kenji Imai]] bears evidence of Gaud\u00ed's influence, as can be seen in the [[Twenty-Six Martyrs Museum and Monument|Memorial for the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan]] in [[Nagasaki]] (Japanese National Architecture Award in 1962), where the use of Gaud\u00ed's famous \"trencad\u00eds\" stands out.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001b|p=74}} <!--Art critics in research and teaching positions since 1950 have given the artist a well-deserved position within 20th-century architecture.-->\n\n=== Design and craftsmanship ===\n[[File:WLM14ES - Barcelona Finca G\u00fcell 58 02 de julio de 2011 - .jpg|thumb|Entrance gate of the [[G\u00fcell Pavilions]]]]\n\nDuring his student days, Gaud\u00ed attended craft workshops, such as those taught by Eudald Punt\u00ed, Lloren\u00e7 Matamala and Joan O\u00f1\u00f3s, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, [[carpentry]], [[wrought ironwork]], [[stained glass]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[plaster]] modelling, etc.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=12}} He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaud\u00ed took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including all the elements of his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.\n\nGaud\u00ed was also an innovator in the realm of craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces (\"[[trencad\u00eds]]\") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented a new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of [[primary colours]], and sometimes a neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Gaud\u00ed-Orfe\u00f3 (1922).jpg|thumb|left|Dedicatory object for [[Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0]] (1922), designed by Gaud\u00ed, drawn by Francesc Quintana and coloured by [[Josep Maria Jujol]]]]\nThis was how he personally designed many of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the [[anatomy]] of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure he was about to sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.{{sfn|Giordano|2011|pp=76\u201377}}\n\n==== Urban spaces and landscaping ====\nGaud\u00ed also practiced landscaping, often in urban settings. He aimed to place his works in the most appropriate natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the [[slate]] of Bellesguard and the grey [[Bierzo]] [[granite]] in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the G\u00fcell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the G\u00fcell Pavilions. Gaud\u00ed's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself\u2014here the Montserrat rock\u2014nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned the path to the Holy Cave.\n\n==== Interiors ====\n[[File:Interior Casa Vicens.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Casa Vicens]]]]\nEqually, Gaud\u00ed stood out as [[interior decorator]], decorating most of his buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case he knew how to apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings\u2014whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to [[liturgical]] furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office at the beginning of his career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of [[Comillas]], he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batll\u00f3 and Mil\u00e0 houses, of the G\u00fcell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. It is noteworthy that Gaud\u00ed studied some [[ergonomy]] in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at [[Gaudi House Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaudiclub.com/esp/e_vida/mobiliario.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926212803/http://www.gaudiclub.com/esp/e_vida/mobiliario.asp |archivedate=26 September 2011 |title=El mobiliario de Gaud\u00ed |accessdate=3 August 2008 |language=Spanish |work=Gaudiclub.com |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n[[File:Gaudi-prie-dieu.jpg|left|thumb|[[Prie-dieu|Prie Dieu]], or prayer desk, designed by Gaud\u00ed for [[Casa Batll\u00f3]]]]\nAnother aspect is the intelligent distribution of space, always with the aim of creating a comfortable, intimate, interior atmosphere. For this purpose, Gaud\u00ed would divide the space into sections, adapted to their specific use, by means of low walls, dropped ceilings, sliding doors and wall closets. Apart from taking care of every detail of all structural and ornamental elements, he made sure his constructions had good lighting and ventilation. For this purpose, he studied each project's orientation with respect to the cardinal points, as well as the local climate and its place in its surroundings. At that time, there was an increasing demand for more domestic comfort, with piped water and gas and the use of electric light, all of which Gaud\u00ed expertly incorporated. For the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, for example, he carried out thorough studies on [[acoustics]] and illumination, in order to optimise them. With regard to light, he stated:\n\n{{quote|text=Light achieves maximum harmony at an inclination of 45\u00b0, since it resides on objects in a way that is neither horizontal nor vertical. This can be considered medium light, and it offers the most perfect vision of objects and their most exquisite nuances. It is the Mediterranean light.{{sfn|Puig i Boada|2004|p=96}}}}\n\nLighting also served Gaud\u00ed for the organisation of space, which required a careful study of the gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Art, oficis i disseny en Gaud\u00ed|p=250}}\n\n== Works ==\n{{Main|List of Gaud\u00ed buildings}}\nGaud\u00ed's work is normally classed as ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'', and it belongs to this movement because of its eagerness to renovate without breaking with tradition, its quest for modernity, the ornamental sense applied to works, and the multidisciplinary character of its undertakings, where craftsmanship plays a central role. To this, Gaud\u00ed adds a dose of the baroque, adopts technical advances and continues to use traditional architectural language. Together with his inspiration from nature and the original touch of his works, this amalgam gives his works their personal and unique character in the history of architecture.\n\nChronologically, it is difficult to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaud\u00ed's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to immerse himself completely in the ''modernista'' movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaud\u00ed's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Berg\u00f3s, according to plastic and structural criteria. Berg\u00f3s establishes five periods in Gaud\u00ed's productions: preliminary period, mud\u00e9jar-morisco (Moorish/mud\u00e9jar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and organic synthesis.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|pp=51\u201368}}\n\n=== Early works ===\nGaud\u00ed's first works both from his student days and the time just after his graduation stand out for the precision of their details, the use of geometry and the prevalence of mechanical considerations in the structural calculations.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=51}}\n\n==== University years ====\nDuring his studies, Gaud\u00ed designed various projects, among which the following stand out: a cemetery gate (1875), a Spanish pavilion for the Philadelphia World Fair of 1876, a quay-side building (1876), a courtyard for the [[Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona]] (1876), a monumental fountain for the [[Pla\u00e7a Catalunya]] in Barcelona (1877) and a university [[assembly hall]] (1877).{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|pp=24\u201329}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Student works\n|-\n| [[File:Puerta cementerio (1875).jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Embarcadero.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Fuente Plaza Catalu\u00f1a.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Paraninfo.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Cemetery gate (1875)\n| Quay-side building (1876)\n| Fountain in Pla\u00e7a Catalunya (1877)\n| University assembly hall (1877)\n|}\n\nAntoni Gaud\u00ed started his professional career while still at university. To pay for his studies, he worked as a draughtsman for some of the most outstanding Barcelona architects of the time, such as [[Joan Martorell]], [[Josep Fontser\u00e8]], [[Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano]], Leandre Serrallach and Emili Sala Cort\u00e9s.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=36}} Gaud\u00ed had a long-standing relationship with Josep Fontser\u00e8, since his family was also from Riudoms and they had known each other for some time. Despite not having an architecture degree, Fontser\u00e8 received the commission from the city council for the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]] development, carried out between 1873 and 1882. For this project, Gaud\u00ed was in charge of the design of the Park's entrance gate, the bandstand's balustrade and the water project for the monumental fountain, where he designed an artificial cave that showed his liking for nature and the organic touch he would give his architecture.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=111}}\n\nGaud\u00ed worked for [[Francisco de Paula del Villar]] on the apse of the Montserrat monastery, designing the niche for the image of the [[Virgin of Montserrat|Black Virgin of Montserrat]] in 1876. He would later substitute Villar in the works of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. With Leandre Serrallach, he worked on a tram line project to Villa Arcadia in Montju\u00efc. Eventually, he collaborated with Joan Martorell on the Jesuit church on Carrer Casp and the Salesian convent in Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as the Villaricos church (Almer\u00eda). He also carried out a project for Martorell for the competition for a new facade for [[Cathedral of Santa Eulalia|Barcelona cathedral]], which was never accepted. His relationship with Martorell, whom he always considered one of his main and most influential masters, brought him unexpected luck; he later recommended Gaud\u00ed for the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.\n\n==== Early post-graduation projects ====\nAfter his graduation as an architect in 1878, Gaud\u00ed's first work was a set of lampposts for the [[Pla\u00e7a Reial]], the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Matar\u00f3 cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=129}} For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Pla\u00e7a Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the [[La Merc\u00e8|Merc\u00e8]] festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a [[marble]] base, they have a decoration in which the [[caduceus]] of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Early post-graduate works\n|-\n| [[File:Pla\u00e7a Reial02.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Kiosco Girossi.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Vitrina Comella.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Farmacia Gibert.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Lampposts\n| Girossi newsstands\n| Esteban Comella display\n| Gibert Pharmacy\n|}\n\nThe Girossi newsstands project, which was never carried out, was a commission from the tradesman Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 [[newsstands]], spread throughout Barcelona. Each would have included a public lavatory, a flower stand and glass panels for advertisements as well as a clock, a calendar, a [[barometer]] and a [[thermometer]]. Gaud\u00ed conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble and glass slabs, crowned by a large iron and glass roof, with a gas illumination system.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=119}}\n\nThe Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Matar\u00f3 Workers' Cooperative) was Gaud\u00ed's first big project, on which he worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pag\u00e8s i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative's head office in Matar\u00f3, comprised a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaud\u00ed used the catenary arch for the first time, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme.{{sfn|Flores|2002|p=26}} He also used ceramic tile decoration for the first time in the services building. Gaud\u00ed laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative's banner, with the figure of a [[bee]], symbol of industriousness.\n\nIn May 1878 Gaud\u00ed designed a display cabinet for the Esteban Comella glove factory, which was exhibited in the Spanish pavilion at the Paris World Exhibition that year.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=139}} It was this work that attracted the attention of the entrepreneur [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]], visiting the French capital; he was so impressed that he wanted to meet Gaud\u00ed on his return, beginning a long friendship and professional collaboration. G\u00fcell became Gaud\u00ed's main patron and sponsor of many of his large projects.\n\n==== First G\u00fcell projects ====\nG\u00fcell's first task for Gaud\u00ed, that same year, was the design of the furniture for the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas, which was then being constructed by Joan Martorell, Gaud\u00ed's teacher, at the request of the Marquis of Comillas, G\u00fcell's father in law. Gaud\u00ed designed a chair, a bench and a prayer stool: the chair was upholstered with velvet, finished with two eagles and the Marquis's coat of arms; the bench stands out with the motif of a dragon, designed by Lloren\u00e7 Matamala; the prayer stool is decorated with plants.\n\nAlso in 1878 he drew up the plans for a theatre in the former town of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona); Gaud\u00ed did not take part in the construction of the theatre, which no longer exists. The following year he designed the furniture and counter for the Gibert Pharmacy, with [[marquetry]] of Arab influence. The same year he made five drawings for a procession in honour of the poet Francesc Vicent Garcia i Torres in [[Vallfogona de Riucorb]], where this celebrated 17th-century writer and friend of [[Lope de Vega]] was the parish priest. Gaud\u00ed's project was centred on the poet and on several aspects of agricultural work, such as reaping and harvesting grapes and olives; however, as a result of organisational problems Gaud\u00ed's ideas were not carried out.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=57}}\n\nBetween 1879 and 1881 he drew up a proposal for the decoration of the church of Sant Paci\u00e0, belonging to the Colegio de Jes\u00fas-Mar\u00eda in Sant Andreu del Palomar: he created the [[altar]] in a Gothic style, the [[monstrance]] with [[Byzantine]] influence, the [[mosaic]]s and the lighting, as well as the school's furniture. The church caught fire during the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] of 1909, and now only the mosaics remain, of \"opus tesselatum\", probably the work of the Italian mosaicist Luigi Pellerin.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=156}} He was given the task of decorating the church of the Colegio de Jes\u00fas-Mar\u00eda in Tarragona (1880\u20131882): he created the altar in white Italian marble, and its front part, or [[antependium]], with four columns bearing medallions of polychrome [[alabaster]], with figures of angels; the [[ostensory]] with gilt wood, the work of Eudald Punt\u00ed, decorated with rosaries, angels, [[tetramorph]] symbols and the dove of the Holy Ghost; and the choir stalls, which were destroyed in 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=161}}\n\nIn 1880 he designed an electric lighting project for Barcelona's Muralla de Mar, or [[seawall]], which was not carried out. It consisted of eight large iron streetlamps, profusely decorated with plant [[motif (music)|motifs]], [[frieze]]s, shields and names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition for the construction of the San Sebasti\u00e1n social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladr\u00e9n Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los R\u00edos; Gaud\u00ed submitted a project that synthesised several of his earlier studies, such as the fountain for the Pla\u00e7a Catalunya and the courtyard of the Provincial Council.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=181}}\n\n==== Collaboration with Martorell ====\n[[File:Gaud\u00ed- Martorell- Catedral BCN (1887).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaud\u00ed's drawing for the facade of the [[Barcelona Cathedral]]]]\nA new task of the G\u00fcell-L\u00f3pez's for [[Comillas]] was the [[gazebo]] for [[Alfonso XII]]'s visit to the [[Cantabria]]n town in 1881. Gaud\u00ed designed a small pavilion in the shape of a [[Hindu]] [[turban]], covered in mosaics and decorated with an abundance of small bells which jingled constantly. It was subsequently moved into the G\u00fcell Pavilions.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=93}}\n\nIn 1882 he designed a Benedictine monastery and a church dedicated to the Holy Spirit in [[Villaricos]] ([[Cuevas de Vera]], [[Almer\u00eda]]) for his former teacher, Joan Martorell. It was of neo-Gothic design, similar to the Convent of the Salesians that Gaud\u00ed also planned with Martorell. Ultimately it was not carried out, and the project plans were destroyed in the looting of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=183}} The same year he was tasked with constructing a [[hunting lodge]] and [[wine cellar]]s at a country residence known as La Cuadra, in Garraf (Sitges), property of baron Eusebi G\u00fcell. Ultimately the wine cellars, but not the lodge, were built some years later. With Martorell he also collaborated on three other projects: the church of the Jesuit School in Carrer Caspe; the Convent of the Salesians in Passeig de Sant Joan, a neo-Gothic project with an altar in the centre of the crossing; and the facade project for Barcelona cathedral, for the competition convened by the cathedral chapter in 1882, ultimately won by Josep Oriol Mestres and August Font i Carreras.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|pp=187\u2013194}}\n\nGaud\u00ed's collaboration with Martorell was a determining factor in Gaud\u00ed's recommendation for the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. The church was the idea of Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of the Devotees of Saint Joseph Association, which acquired a complete block of Barcelona's [[Eixample]] district.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=113}} The project was originally entrusted to Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, who planned the construction of a neo-Gothic church, on which work began in 1882. However, the following year Villar resigned due to disagreements with the construction board, and the task went to Gaud\u00ed, who completely redesigned the project, apart from the part of the crypt that had already been built.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=117}} Gaud\u00ed devoted the rest of his life to the construction of the church, which was to be the synthesis of all of his architectural discoveries.\n\n=== Orientalist period ===\nDuring these years Gaud\u00ed completed a series of works with a distinctly oriental flavour, inspired by the art of the Middle and Far East (India, Persia, Japan), as well as Islamic-Hispanic art, mainly [[Mudejar]] and [[Nazari]]. Gaud\u00ed used ceramic tile decoration abundantly, as well as Moorish arches, columns of exposed brick and pinnacles in the shape of pavilions or domes.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=52}}\n\nBetween 1883 and 1888 he constructed the [[Casa Vicens]], commissioned by stockbroker Manuel Vicens i Montaner. It was constructed with four floors, with facades on three sides and an extensive garden, including a monumental brick fountain. The house was surrounded by a wall with iron gates, decorated with [[Sabal|palmetto]] leaves, work of Lloren\u00e7 Matamala. The walls of the house are of stone alternated with lines of tile, which imitate yellow flowers typical of this area; the house is topped with chimneys and turrets. In the interior the polychrome wooden roof beams stand out, adorned with floral themes of [[papier mach\u00e9]]; the walls are decorated with vegetable motifs, as well as paintings by Josep Torrescasana; finally, the floor consists of Roman-style mosaics of \"opus tesselatum\". Among the most original rooms is the smoking room, notable the ceiling, decorated with Moorish honeycomb-work, reminiscent of the [[Generalife]] in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=107}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Orientalist works\n|-\n| [[File:Vicens03.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Capricho gaudi 201108.jpg|120px]]\n| [[File:Pavellons G\u00fcell01.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Palau G\u00fcell, Antoni Gaudi, Barcelona 1.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Trasatl\u00e1ntica (1888).jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Casa Vicens (1883\u201388)\n| [[El Capricho]] (1883\u201385)\n| G\u00fcell Pavilions (1884\u201387)\n| Palau G\u00fcell (1886\u201388)\n| Compa\u00f1\u00eda Trasatl\u00e1ntica (1888)\n|}\nIn the same year, 1883, Gaud\u00ed designed the [[Altarpiece of Alella|Sant\u00edsimo Sacramento chapel for the parish church of San F\u00e9lix de Alella]], as well as some topographical plans for the Can Rosell de la Llena country residence in Gelida. He also received a commission to build a small annex to the Palacio de Sobrellano, for the Baron of Comillas, in the [[Cantabria]]n town of the same name. Known as El Capricho, it was commissioned by M\u00e1ximo D\u00edaz de Quijano and constructed between 1883 and 1885. Crist\u00f2for Cascante i Colom, Gaud\u00ed's fellow student, directed the construction. In an oriental style, it has an elongated shape, on three levels and a cylindrical tower in the shape of a Persian minaret, faced completely in ceramics. The entrance is set behind four columns supporting depressed arches, with capitals decorated with birds and leaves, similar to those that can be seen at the Casa Vicens. Notable are the main lounge, with its large [[sash window]], and the smoking room with a ceiling consisting of a false Arab-style stucco vault.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=15}}\n\nGaud\u00ed carried out a second commission from Eusebi G\u00fcell between 1884 and 1887, the G\u00fcell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now on the outskirts of Barcelona. G\u00fcell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarri\u00e0, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuy\u00e0s de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 to make way for the [[Palau Reial de Pedralbes|Royal Palace of Pedralbes]]. Gaud\u00ed undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with [[symbology]] allusive to the myths of [[Hercules]] and the [[Garden of the Hesperides]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|pp=125\u2013126}} The buildings consist of a stable, covered [[longeing]] ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows<!-- , and covered in a variety of colours-->; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real C\u00e1tedra Gaud\u00ed, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.\n\nIn 1885 Gaud\u00ed accepted a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promoter of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, for an [[altar]] in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained permission from the Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished [[mahogany]], with a slab of [[white marble]] in the centre for [[relics]]. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of [[Saint Francis of Paola]], [[Saint Teresa of Avila]] and the [[Holy Family]] and closed with a curtain of crimson embroidery. It was made by the cabinet maker Frederic Lab\u00f2ria, who also collaborated with Gaud\u00ed on the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=281}}\n\nShortly after, Gaud\u00ed received an important new commission from G\u00fcell: the construction of his family house, in the [[Carrer Nou de la Rambla]] in Barcelona. The [[Palau G\u00fcell]] (1886\u20131888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions such as those in Carrer Montcada. Gaud\u00ed designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent [[parabolic arch]] above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan O\u00f1\u00f3s. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaud\u00ed used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=128}} He designed the interior of the palace with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire in the form of a [[Lantern (architecture)|lantern tower]], which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron [[weather vane]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=290}}\n\nOn the occasion of the World Expo held in Barcelona in 1888, Gaud\u00ed constructed the pavilion for the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Trasatl\u00e1ntica, property of the Marquis of Comillas, in the Maritime Section of the event. He created it in a Granadinian Nazari style, with horseshoe arches and stucco decoration; the building survived until the Passeig Mar\u00edtim was opened up in 1960. In the wake of the event he received a commission from Barcelona Council to restore the Sal\u00f3 de Cent and the grand stairs in Barcelona City Hall, as well as a chair for the queen Maria Cristina; only the chair was made, and Mayor [[Francesc de Paula Rius i Taulet|Francesc Rius i Taulet]] presented it to the Queen.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=313}}\n\n=== Neo-Gothic period ===\nDuring this period Gaud\u00ed was inspired above all by mediaeval [[Gothic art]], but wanted to improve on its structural solutions. [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-gothic]] was one of the most successful historicist styles at that time, above all as a result of the theoretical studies of Viollet-le-Duc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/history392.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015110704/http://all-art.org/history392.html |archivedate=15 October 2011 |title=The 18th and 19th Centuries: Neoclassicism and Romanticism: Gothic Revival |accessdate=18 October 2011 |work=All-art.org |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Gaud\u00ed studied examples in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in depth, as well as Leonese and Castillian buildings during his stays in Le\u00f3n and Burgos, and became convinced that it was an imperfect style, leaving major structural issues only partly resolved. In his works he eliminated the need of buttresses through the use of [[ruled surface]]s, and abolished crenellations and excessive openwork.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=56}}\n\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Neo-gothic works\n|-\n| [[File:Teresianas01.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Palacio episcopal de Astorga.JPG|150px]]\n| [[File:Casabotines1.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Celler G\u00fcell01.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Bellesguard04.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Teresian College\n| [[Episcopal Palace, Astorga|Episcopal Palace]]\n| [[Casa Botines]]\n| Bodegues G\u00fcell\n| Torre Bellesguard\n|}\nThe first example was the Teresian College (''Col\u00b7legi de les Teresianes'') (1888\u20131889), in Barcelona's Carrer Ganduxer, commissioned by San Enrique de Oss\u00f3. Gaud\u00ed fulfilled the wish of the order that the building should be austere, in keeping with their vows of poverty. He designed a simple building, using bricks for the exterior and some brick elements for the interior. Wrought ironwork, one of Gaud\u00ed's favourite materials, appeared on the facades. The building is crowned by a row of [[merlon]]s which suggest a castle, a possible reference to [[Saint Teresa of Avila|Saint Teresa]]'s ''Interior Castle''.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=33}} The corners have brick pinnacles topped by helicoidal columns and culminate in a four-armed cross, typical of Gaud\u00ed's works, and with ceramic shields bearing various symbols of the order. The interior includes a corridor which is famous for the series of catenary arches that it contains. These elegant arches are decorative and support the ceiling and the floor above. For Gaud\u00ed, the catenary arch was an ideal constructional element, capable of supporting great loads with slender masonry.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=94}}\n\nGaud\u00ed received his next commission from a clergyman who had been a boyhood friend in his native Reus. When he was appointed bishop of Astorga, Joan Baptista Grau i Vallespin\u00f3s asked Gaud\u00ed to design a new episcopal palace for the city, as the previous building had caught fire. Constructed between 1889 and 1915, in a neo-Gothic style with four cylindrical towers, it was surrounded by a [[moat]]. The stone with which it was built (grey granite from the El Bierzo area) is in harmony with its surroundings, particularly with the cathedral in its immediate vicinity, as well as with the natural landscape, which in late 19th-century Astorga was more visible than today. The porch has three large flared arches, built of [[ashlar]] and separated by sloping [[buttress]]es. The structure is supported by columns with decorated capitals and by ribbed vaults on pointed arches, and topped with Mudejar-style merlons. Gaud\u00ed resigned from the project in 1893, at the death of Bishop Grau, due to disagreements with the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]], and it was finished in 1915 by Ricardo Garc\u00eda Guereta. It currently houses a museum about the [[Way of Saint James]], which passes through Astorga.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=150}}\n\nAnother of Gaud\u00ed's projects outside of Catalonia was the [[Casa Botines|Casa de los Botines]], in [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] (1891\u20131894), commissioned by Sim\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez Fern\u00e1ndez and Mariano Andr\u00e9s Luna, textile merchants from Le\u00f3n, who were recommended Gaud\u00ed by Eusebi G\u00fcell, with whom they did business. Gaud\u00ed's project was an impressive neo-Gothic style building, which bears his unmistakable ''modernista'' imprint. The building was used to accommodate offices and textile shops on the lower floors, as well as apartments on the upper floors. It was constructed with walls of solid [[limestone]].{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=37}} The building is flanked by four cylindrical turrets surmounted by slate [[spire]]s, and surrounded by an [[Area (architecture)|area]] with an iron grille. <!--The windows are of guillotine style, with sloped ledges to hold the snow, very common in Leon's winter.--> The Gothic facade style, with its cusped arches, has a clock and a sculpture of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], the work of Lloren\u00e7 Matamala.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=155}} As of 2010 it was the headquarters of the Caja Espa\u00f1a.\n\nIn 1892 Gaud\u00ed was commissioned by Claudio L\u00f3pez Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions for the city of [[Tangier]], in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaud\u00ed conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaud\u00ed deeply regretted the project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, in particular the design of the towers, with their paraboloid shape like those of the Missions.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=333}}\n[[File:Misiones Franciscanas (T\u00e1nger).jpg|thumb|right|Franciscan Mission of Tangiers]]\nIn 1895 he designed a funerary chapel for the G\u00fcell family at the abbey of [[Montserrat Abbey|Montserrat]], but little is known about this work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the [[Bodegas G\u00fcell]], the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi G\u00fcell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 under the direction of Francesc Berenguer, Gaud\u00ed's aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join them to an older building. It has three floors: the bottom one for a garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter's lodge, notable for the iron gate in the shape of a fishing net.\n\nIn the township of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona), the widow of Jaume Figueras commissioned Gaud\u00ed to renovate the Torre Bellesguard (1900\u20131909), former summer palace of [[Martin of Aragon|King Martin I the Humane]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=165}} Gaud\u00ed designed it in a neo-Gothic style, respecting the former building as much as possible, and tried as always to integrate the architecture into the natural surroundings. This influenced his choice of local slate for the construction. The building's ground-plan measures 15 x 15 meters, with the corners oriented to the four cardinal points. Constructed in stone and brick, it is taller than it is wide, with a spire topped with the four-armed cross, the Catalan flag and the royal crown. The house has a basement, ground floor, first floor and an attic, with a gable roof.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=49}}\n\n=== Naturalist period ===\nDuring this period Gaud\u00ed perfected his personal style, inspired by the organic shapes of nature, putting into practise a whole series of new structural solutions originating from his deep analysis of [[Ruled surface|ruled geometry]]. To this he added a great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=60}}\n\n==== 1898\u20131900 ====\nCommissioned by the company Hijos de Pedro M\u00e1rtir Calvet, Gaud\u00ed built the [[Casa Calvet]] (1898\u20131899), in Barcelona's Carrer Casp. The facade is built of Montju\u00efc stone, adorned with wrought iron balconies and topped with two pediments with wrought iron crosses. Another notable feature of the facade is the gallery on the main floor, decorated with plant and mythological motifs. For this project, Gaud\u00ed used a Baroque style, visible in the use of Solomonic columns, decoration with floral themes and the design of the terraced roof <!--with cascades and Rococo flowerpot holders-->. In 1900, he won the award for the best building of the year from Barcelona City Council.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001a|p=241}}\n\nA virtually unknown work by Gaud\u00ed is the Casa Clap\u00e9s (1899\u20131900), at 125 Carrer Escorial, commissioned by the painter Aleix Clap\u00e9s, who collaborated on occasion with Gaud\u00ed, such as in decorating the [[Palau G\u00fcell]] and the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]]. It has a ground floor and three apartments, with stuccoed walls and cast-iron balconies. Due to its lack of decoration or original structural solutions its authorship was unknown until 1976, when the architect's signed plans by Gaud\u00ed were discovered.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=375}} In 1900, he renovated the house of Dr. Pere Santal\u00f3, at 32 [[Carrer Nou de la Rambla]], a work of equally low importance. Santal\u00f3 was a friend of Gaud\u00ed's, whom he accompanied during his stay in Puigcerd\u00e0 in 1911.It was he who recommended him to do manual work for his rheumatism.{{sfn|Van Hensbergen|2004|p=272}}\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; padding:2px; border: 1px solid #BBB; text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#EEE\" |Naturalist works (1898\u20131900)\n|-\n| [[File:Casa Calvet.jpg|120px]]\n| [[File:Porta Miralles.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Park G\u00fcell 02.jpg|150px]]\n| [[File:Gaud\u00ed-Rosario Monumental de Montserrat.jpg|150px]]\n|- style=\"background:#EEE\"\n| Casa Calvet\n| Finca Miralles\n| Park G\u00fcell\n| Rosary of Montserrat\n|}\n\nAlso in 1900, he designed two banners: for the Orfe\u00f3 Feliu\u00e0 (of Sant Feliu de Codines), made of brass, leather, cork and silk, with ornamental motifs based on the martyrdom of San F\u00e9lix (a millstone), music (a staff and clef) and the inscription \"Orfe\u00f3 Feliu\u00e0\"; and [[Banner of Misericordia|Our Lady of Mercy]] of Reus, for the pilgrimage of the Reus residents of Barcelona, with an image of Isabel Besora, the shepherdess to whom the Virgin appeared in 1592, work of Aleix Clap\u00e9s and, on the back, a rose and the Catalan flag. In the same year, for the shrine of Our Lady of Mercy in Reus, Gaud\u00ed outlined a project for the renovation of the church's main facade, which ultimately was not undertaken, as the board considered it too expensive. Gaud\u00ed took this rejection quite badly, leaving some bitterness towards Reus, possibly the source of his subsequent claim that Riudoms was his place of birth.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=425}} Between 1900 and 1902 Gaud\u00ed worked on the Casa Miralles, commissioned by the industrialist Hermenegild Miralles i Angl\u00e8s; Gaud\u00ed designed only the wall near the gateway, of undulating masonry, with an iron gate topped with the four-armed cross. Subsequently, the house for Se\u00f1or Miralles was designed by Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es, associate architect of Gaud\u00ed.\n\nGaud\u00ed's main new project at the beginning of the 20th century was the [[Park G\u00fcell]] (1900\u20131914), commissioned by Eusebi G\u00fcell. It was intended to be a residential estate in the style of an English [[garden city movement|garden city]]. The project was unsuccessful: of the 60 plots into which the site was divided only one was sold. Despite this, the park entrances and service areas were built, displaying Gaud\u00ed's genius and putting into practice many of his innovative structural solutions. The Park G\u00fcell is situated in Barcelona's C\u00e0rmel district, a rugged area, with steep slopes that Gaud\u00ed negotiated with a system of viaducts integrated into the terrain. The main entrance to the park has a building on each side, intended as a porter's lodge and an office, and the site is surrounded by a stone and glazed-ceramic wall. These entrance buildings are an example of Gaud\u00ed at the height of his powers, with Catalan vaults that form a parabolic hyperboloid.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=176}} After passing through the gate, steps lead to higher levels, decorated with sculpted fountains, notably the dragon fountain, which has become a symbol of the park and one of Gaud\u00ed's most recognised emblems. These steps lead to the [[Hypostyle]] Hall, which was to have been the residents' market, constructed with large [[Dorian mode|Doric]] columns. Above this chamber is a large plaza in the form of a Greek theatre, with the famous undulating bench covered in broken ceramics (\"[[trencad\u00eds]]\"), the work of [[Josep Maria Jujol]].{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=150}} The park's show home, the work of Francesc Berenguer, was Gaud\u00ed's residence from 1906 to 1926, and currently houses the [[Gaudi House Museum|Casa-Museu Gaud\u00ed]].\n\nDuring this period Gaud\u00ed contributed to a group project, the Rosary of Montserrat (1900\u20131916). Located on the way to the Holy Cave of Montserrat, it was a series of groups of sculptures that evoked the mysteries of the Virgin, who tells the rosary. This project involved the best architects and sculptors of the era, and is a curious example of Catalan Modernism. Gaud\u00ed designed the First Mystery of Glory, which represents the Holy Sepulcher. The series include a statue of Christ Risen, the work of [[Josep Llimona]], and the Three Marys sculpted by [[Dion\u00eds Renart]]. Another monumental project designed by Gaud\u00ed for Montserrat was never carried out: it would have included crowning the summit of El Cavall Bernat (one of the mountain peaks) with a viewpoint in the shape of a royal crown, incorporating a {{convert|20|m|ft}} high Catalan coat of arms into the wall.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=79}}\n\n==== 1901\u201303 ====\nIn 1901 Gaud\u00ed decorated the house of Isabel G\u00fcell L\u00f3pez, Marchioness of Castelldosrius, and daughter of Eusebi G\u00fcell. Situated at 19 Carrer Junta de Comer\u00e7, the house had been built in 1885 and renovated between 1901 and 1904; it was destroyed by a bomb during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=435}} The following year Gaud\u00ed took part in the decoration of the Bar Torino, property of Flaminio Mezzalana, located at 18 Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia; Gaud\u00ed designed the ornamentation of el Sal\u00f3n \u00c1rabe of that establishment, made with varnished Arabian-style cardboard tiles (which no longer exist).\n\nA project of great interest to Gaud\u00ed was the restoration of the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Palma de Mallorca (1903\u20131914), commissioned by the city's bishop, Pere Campins i Barcel\u00f3. Gaud\u00ed planned a series of works including removing the baroque altarpiece, revealing the bishop's throne, moving the choir-stalls from the centre of the nave and placing them in the presbytery, clearing the way through chapel of the Holy Trinity, placing new pulpits, fitting the cathedral with electrical lighting, uncovering the Gothic windows of the Royal Chapel and filling them with stained glass, placing a large canopy above the main altar and completing the decoration with paintings. This was coordinated by Joan Rubi\u00f3 i Bellver, Gaud\u00ed's assistant. Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda, Iu Pascual and Jaume Llongueras were also involved. Gaud\u00ed abandoned the project in 1914 due to disagreements with the Cathedral chapter.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=221}}\n\n==== 1904 ====\n[[File:Casabatllo2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Casa Batll\u00f3]]]]\nAmong Gaud\u00ed's largest and most striking works is the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]] (1904\u20131906). Commissioned by Josep Batll\u00f3 i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cort\u00e9s,{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=184}} Gaud\u00ed focused on the fa\u00e7ade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es, Joan Rubi\u00f3 and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montju\u00efc sandstone cut to create warped [[ruled surface]]s; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaud\u00ed kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies\u2014with iron railings in the shape of masks\u2014giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours (\"trencad\u00eds\"), which Gaud\u00ed obtained from the waste material of the Pelegr\u00ed glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure in the shape of a double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaud\u00ed's four-armed cross.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=187}}\n\nIn 1904, commissioned by the painter [[Llu\u00eds Graner]], he designed the decoration of the Sala Merc\u00e8, in the [[Rambla dels Estudis]], one of the first cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and the main gate were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to the Casa Batll\u00f3 or the porter's lodge of the Park G\u00fcell.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=471}}\n\n[[File:Chalet Catllar\u00e0s (1905)B2.jpg|thumb|left|El chalet de Catllar\u00e0s (1905), in [[La Pobla de Lillet]]]]\nThe same year he built a workshop, the Taller Badia, for Josep and Llu\u00eds Badia Miarnau,\nblacksmiths who worked for Gaud\u00ed on several of his works, such as the Batll\u00f3 and Mil\u00e0 houses, the Park G\u00fcell and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Located at 278 Carrer N\u00e0pols, it was a simple stone building. Around that time he also designed hexagonal [[Cement tile|hydraulic floor tiles]] for the Casa Batll\u00f3, they were eventually used instead for the Casa Mil\u00e0; they were a green colour and were decorated with seaweed, shells and starfish. These tiles were subsequently chosen to pave Barcelona's Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia.{{sfn|Saudi|2002|loc=Chapter: Gaud\u00ed i els seus co\u0140laboradors: artistes i industrials a l'entorn del 1900|p=271}}\n\nAlso in 1904 he built the Chalet de Catllar\u00e0s, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi G\u00fcell. It has a simple structure though very original, in the shape of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one.<!--<ref>http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AA020%20Catllaras%20Villa.htm</ref> --> In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park G\u00fcell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=469}}\n\n==== 1906 ====\n[[File:Lillet21.jpg|thumb|[[Artigas Gardens]], in [[La Pobla de Lillet]]]]\nIn 1906 he designed a bridge over the Torrent de Pomeret, between Sarri\u00e0 and Sant Gervasi. This river flowed directly between two of Gaud\u00ed's works, Bellesguard and the Chalet Graner, and so he was asked to bridge the divide. Gaud\u00ed designed an interesting structure composed of juxtaposed triangles that would support the bridge's framework, following the style of the viaducts that he made for the Park G\u00fcell. It would have been built with cement, and would have had a length of {{convert|154|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|15|m|ft}}; the balustrade would have been covered with glazed tiles, with an inscription dedicated to Santa Eul\u00e0lia. The project was not approved by the Town Council of Sarri\u00e0.{{sfn|Bassegoda|2002|p=214}}\n\nThe same year Gaud\u00ed apparently took part in the construction of the {{interlanguage link|Torre Mateu|es|lt=Torre Dami\u00e0 Mateu, in Llinars del Vall\u00e8s}}, in collaboration with his disciple Francesc Berenguer, though the project's authorship is not clear or to what extent they each contributed to it. The style of the building evokes Gaud\u00ed's early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the G\u00fcell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate in the shape of a fishing net, currently installed in the Park G\u00fcell. The building was demolished in 1939.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=507}} Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of metalworkers and blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona's coat of arms in the upper left corner, and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical tools of the trade. The banner was burned in July 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=509}}\n\n[[File:Casa Mil\u00e0, general view.jpg|thumb|[[Casa Mil\u00e0 (La Pedrera)]]]]\n\nAnother of Gaud\u00ed's major projects and among his most admired works is the [[Casa Mil\u00e0]], better known as La Pedrera (1906\u20131910), commissioned by Pere Mil\u00e0 i Camps. Gaud\u00ed designed the house around two large, curved courtyards, with a structure of stone, brick and cast-iron columns and steel beams. The facade is built of limestone from Vilafranca del Pened\u00e8s, apart from the upper level, which is covered in white tiles, evoking a snowy mountain. It has a total of five floors, plus a loft made entirely of catenary arches, as well as two large interior courtyards, one circular and one oval. Notable features are the staircases to the roof, topped with the four-armed cross, and the chimneys, covered in ceramics and with shapes that suggest mediaeval helmets. The interior decoration was carried out by Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogu\u00e9s and Aleix Clap\u00e9s. The facade was to have been completed with a stone, metal and glass sculpture with Our lady of the Rosary accompanied by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, 4&nbsp;m in height. A sketch was made by the sculptor Carles Mani, but due to the events of the Tragic Week in 1909 the project was abandoned.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001a|p=296}}\n\n==== 1907\u201308 ====\nIn 1907, to mark the seventh centenary of the birth of [[James I of Aragon|King James I]], Gaud\u00ed designed a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Pla\u00e7a del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa \u00c0gada, dedicated to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next to the walls (now the Pla\u00e7a Ramon Berenguer el Grand). The project was not executed because the city council disliked it.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=529}}\n\nIn 1908 Gaud\u00ed devised a project for a skyscraper hotel in New York City, the [[Hotel Attraction]], commissioned by two American entrepreneurs whose names are unknown. It would have been {{convert|360|m|ft}} high (taller than the [[Empire State Building]]), with a taller parabolic central section, topped with a star, and flanked by four volumes containing museums, art galleries and concert halls, with shapes similar to the Casa Mil\u00e0. Inside it would have had five large rooms, one dedicated to every continent.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=531}}\n\n[[File:Proyecto original Colonia G\u00fcell.jpg|thumb|upright|Original design of the church for the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]]\n\nThe final project for his great patron Eusebi G\u00fcell was the church for the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell, an industrial village in Santa Coloma de Cervell\u00f3 (1890\u20131918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What would have been the colony's church was designed by Gaud\u00ed in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the crypt (known today as Crypt of the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell) was built, as G\u00fcell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaud\u00ed designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults precedes the crypt, the first time that Gaud\u00ed used this structure and notably the first use of paraboloid vaults in the history of architecture.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=370}} In the crypt the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.\n\n=== Final period ===\n[[File:SF - Escuelas.jpg|thumb|Sagrada Familia schools]]\nDuring the last years of his career, dedicated almost exclusively to the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]], Gaud\u00ed reached the culmination of this naturalistic style, creating a synthesis of all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then. Gaud\u00ed achieved perfect harmony between structural and ornamental elements, between plastic and aesthetic, between function and form, between container and content, achieving the integration of all arts in one structured, logical work.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=68}}\n\nThe first example of his final stage can be seen in a simple but very ingenious building, the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia schools]], a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a rectangular ground plan of {{convert|10|x|20|m|ft}}, and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Fam\u00edlia schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as a source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.{{sfn|Crippa|2003|p=79}}\n\nIn May 1910 Gaud\u00ed paid a short visit to Vic, where he was tasked to design the lampposts for the city's Pla\u00e7a Major, in commemoration of the first centenary of the birth of [[Jaume Balmes]]. They were obelisk-shaped lamps, with basalt rock bases from Castellfollit de la Roca and wrought iron arms, topped with the four-armed cross; they were decorated with vegetable themes and included the birth and death dates of Balmes. They were demolished in 1924 due to poor maintenance.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=555}}\n\nThe same year, on the occasion of Eusebi G\u00fcell's obtaining the title of count, Gaud\u00ed designed a coat of arms for his patron. He devised a shield with the lower part in a catenary shape typical of Gaud\u00ed. He divided it into two parts: the lantern of Palau G\u00fcell features a dove and a gear-wheel on the right in allusion to the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell in Santa Coloma de Cervell\u00f3 (''coloma'' is Catalan for dove), with the phrase ''ahir pastor'' (yesterday Shepherd). On the left is an owl perched on a half-moon\u2014symbol of prudence and wisdom\u2014with the words ''avuy senyor'' (today Lord). The shield is surmounted by a helmet with the count's coronet and the dove symbol of the Holy Spirit.{{sfn|Mass\u00f3|1974|p=49}}\n\nIn 1912 he built two [[pulpit]]s for the church of Santa Maria in [[Blanes]]: the pulpit on the [[Gospel side]] had a hexagonal base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the [[Epistle side]] had the names of the apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=495}}<!-- For the restoration of the Cathedral of Manresa, Gaud\u00ed was asked in 1915 to conduct a preliminary assessment by the architect Alexandre Soler i March, in charge of the works. Gaud\u00ed suggested some corrections, such as placing a hall next to the baptistery, a gabled roof over the main hall and a room above the hall for a museum and archive.-->\n\n==== Sagrada Fam\u00edlia ====\n[[File:SF - lago.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia|Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]]]]\n{{Main|Sagrada Fam\u00edlia}}\nFrom 1915 Gaud\u00ed devoted himself almost exclusively to his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the [[crypt]] and the [[apse]], still in Gothic style, the rest of the church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of [[ruled surface]]s. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaud\u00ed applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park G\u00fcell and the crypt of the Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.\n\nThe Sagrada Fam\u00edlia has a cruciform plan, with a five-aisled nave, a transept of three aisles, and an apse with seven chapels. It has three facades dedicated to the birth, passion and glory of Jesus, and when completed it will have eighteen towers: four at each side making a total of twelve for the apostles, four on the transept invoking the evangelists and one on the apse dedicated to the Virgin, plus the central tower in honour of Jesus, which will reach {{convert|172.5|m|ft}} in height.{{sfn|Zerbst|2002|p=198}} The church will have two [[sacristy|sacristies]] adjacent to the apse, and three large chapels: one for the Assumption in the apse, and the Baptism and Penitence chapels at the west end; also, it will be surrounded by a cloister designed for processions and to isolate the building from the exterior. Gaud\u00ed used highly symbolic content in the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, both in architecture and sculpture, dedicating each part of the church to a religious theme.\n\nDuring Gaud\u00ed's life only the crypt, apse and part of the Nativity facade were completed. Upon his death his assistant Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es took over the construction; thereafter it was directed by various architects. Jordi Bonet i Armengol assumed responsibility in 1987 and continued as of 2011. Artists such as Lloren\u00e7 and Joan Matamala, Carles Mani, Jaume Busquets, Joaquim Ros i Bofarull, Etsuro Sotoo and Josep Maria Subirachs (creator of the Passion facade) have worked on the sculptural decoration. Completion is not expected until at least 2026.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sagrada Fam\u00edlia gets final completion date&nbsp;\u2013 2026 or 2028 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/22/sagrada-familia-final-completion-date |first= Giles |last=Tremlett |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Minor, late projects ====\nDuring the last years of his life, apart from his devotion to the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Gaud\u00ed participated only in minor projects, which were not completed: in 1916, on the death of his friend bishop Josep Torras i Bages, he designed a monument in his honour, which he wanted to place in front of the Passion facade of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. He made a sketch of the project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaud\u00ed. It was put in the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=563}} Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellter\u00e7ol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped with an iron structure flying the Catalan flag. The sketch of the project was done by Llu\u00eds Bonet i Gar\u00ed, Gaud\u00ed's assistant.{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=565}}\n\nIn 1922 Gaud\u00ed was commissioned, by the Franciscan Padre Ang\u00e9lico Aranda, to construct a church dedicated to the Assumption in the Chilean city of [[Rancagua]].{{sfn|Bassegoda|1989|p=581}} Gaud\u00ed apologised and said that he was occupied exclusively with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, but sent some sketches of the Assumption chapel which he had designed for the apse of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which more or less coincided with what Padre Aranda had asked for. Unfortunately this project was not carried out, though there are currently plans by the Chilean architect [[Christian Matzner]] to take up the project. The [[President of Chile]], [[Michelle Bachelet]], has announced that building will begin in 2015, with an expected completion in 2017 and at a cost of [[US dollar|$]]7&nbsp;million. Once completed it will become the first of Gaud\u00ed's works to be constructed in the Americas.{{sfn|F\u00e9rrin|2001b|p=47}}<ref>{{cite news | first = Ashifa | last = Kassam | title = Chile's Gaudi plan gets off the drawing board | work = The Guardian | date = 17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe same year Gaud\u00ed was consulted about the construction of a monumental train station for Barcelona (the future [[Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a]]). Gaud\u00ed suggested an iron structure in the form of a large suspended awning, a solution quite ahead of its time; perhaps for this reason, it put the head engineers off, and they declined Gaud\u00ed's offer. The last known projects by the architect are the chapel for the Col\u00f3nia Calvet in Torell\u00f3, of 1923, and a pulpit for Valencia (the exact location is unknown), of 1924. From then on, Gaud\u00ed worked exclusively on the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia until his death.\n\n== Collaborators ==\nThe enormous task which Gaud\u00ed faced, not in terms of the number of works, but in terms of their complexity, required the collaboration of a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen. Gaud\u00ed always led the way, but allowed expression of the individual abilities of all of his collaborators. A test of his expertise both in his field and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Collaboradors.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128182400/http://gaudiallgaudi.com/EA002%20G%20Collaboradors.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |title=Colaboradores de Gaud\u00ed |accessdate=3 August 2008 |work=Gaudiallgaudi.com |language=Spanish |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\nAmong his collaborators were:\n* Architects: Francesc Berenguer, Josep Maria Jujol, Crist\u00f2for Cascante i Colom, Josep Francesc R\u00e0fols, C\u00e8sar Martinell, Joan Berg\u00f3s, Francesc Folguera, Josep Canaleta, Joan Rubi\u00f3, Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es, Francesc Quintana, Isidre Puig i Boada, Llu\u00eds Bonet i Gar\u00ed.\n* Sculptors: Carles Mani, Joan Flotats, Lloren\u00e7 Matamala, Joan Matamala, Josep Llimona.\n* Painters: Ricard Opisso, Aleix Clap\u00e9s, Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogu\u00e9s, Jaume Llongueras, Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda.\n* Builders and foremen: Agust\u00ed Massip, Josep Bay\u00f3 i Font, Claudi Alsina i Bonafont, Josep Pardo i Casanova and his nephew Juli\u00e0 Bardier i Pardo.\n* Craftsmen: Eudald Punt\u00ed (carpenter and forger), Joan O\u00f1\u00f3s (forger), Llu\u00eds y Josep Badia i Miarnau (forger), Joan Bertran (plasterer), Joan Munn\u00e9 (cabinet maker), Frederic Lab\u00f2ria (cabinet maker), Antoni Rigalt i Blanch (glazier), Josep Pelegr\u00ed (glazier), Mario Maragliano (mosaic artist), Jaume Pujol i Bausis and his son Pau Pujol i Vil\u00e0 (ceramicists).\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nGaud\u00ed was run down by a streetcar, and died in 1926. He is buried in the Sagrada Familia. After his death, Gaud\u00ed's works suffered a period of neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by ''[[Noucentisme]]'', the new movement which took the place of ''Modernisme''. In 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], Gaud\u00ed's workshop in the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia was ransacked, and a great number of his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.\n\nGaud\u00ed's reputation was beginning to recover by the 1950s, when his work was championed not only by [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] but also by architect [[Josep Llu\u00eds Sert]]. In 1952, the centenary year of the architect's birth, the Asociaci\u00f3n de Amigos de Gaud\u00ed (Friends of Gaud\u00ed Association) was founded with the aim of disseminating and conserving his legacy. Four years later, a retrospective was organised at the [[Palau Reial Major|Sal\u00f3 del Tinell]] in Barcelona, and the Gaud\u00ed Chair at the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]] was created with the purpose of deepening the study of the Gaud\u00ed's works and participating in their conservation. These events were followed in 1957 by Gaud\u00ed's first international exhibition, held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. In 1976, on the 50th anniversary of his death, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs organised an exhibition about Gaud\u00ed and his works that toured the globe.<ref name=\"Cerv\">{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/gaudi/bassegoda.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709074728/http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/gaudi/bassegoda.htm |archivedate=9 July 2012 |title=Antoni Gaud\u00ed Cornet (1852\u20131926) |accessdate=3 August 2008 |last=Bassegoda |first=Juan |work=Instituto Cervantes |language=Spanish |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1960, research and writings by international critics like George R. Collins, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] and Roberto Pane spread a renewed awareness of Gaud\u00ed's work, while in his homeland it was admired and promoted by Alexandre Cirici, [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]] and [[Oriol Bohigas]]. Gaud\u00ed's work has since gained widespread international appreciation, such as in Japan where notable studies have been published by [[Hiroya Tanka Architect|Dr. Hiroya Tanaka (Gaudi Prize winner)]], [[Kenji Imai (architect)|Kenji Imai]] and [[Tokutoshi Torii]].
