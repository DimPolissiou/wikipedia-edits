A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation]]s on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> A binary operation on {{mvar|F}} is a mapping {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}}, that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of ''F'' a uniquely determined element of {{mvar|F}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=16}}</ref> The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].</ref> One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation (the multiplicative inverse), and two constants {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (\u22121)}} and {{math|1=&minus;''a'' = (&minus;1)''a''}}.<ref group=nb>The a priori twofold use of the symbol \"\u2212\" for denoting one part of a constant and for the additive inverses is justified by this latter condition.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{main|Rational number}}\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, the field of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that \n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>}},\nsince all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}.

Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}.

Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below.

For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are in {{math|''R''}}, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;{{math|\u2265}}. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ... = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction.

The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields.

In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F'' \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem.

Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]].

For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}.

This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical.

A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation]]s on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> A binary operation on {{mvar|F}} is a mapping {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}}, that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of ''F'' a uniquely determined element of {{mvar|F}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=16}}</ref> The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called ''the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}'', and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called ''the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}'', and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms,  {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}},  and  {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}.

The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b  = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of  {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, the field of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that \n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>}},\nsince all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}.

Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}.

Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to {{math|'''Q'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=p. 12}}</ref>\n\n==Finite fields==\n{{main|Finite field}}\n''Finite fields'' (also called ''Galois fields'') are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} is a field with four elements.

However, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field because 12 is not a prime number.]]\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible).

Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}  are in {{math|''R''}}, and  {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and  {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in  {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;{{math|\u2265}}. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ... = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\u221e}}) is zero.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Field !! Metric !! Completion !! zero sequence\n|-\n| {{math|'''Q'''}} || {{math|<nowiki>|</nowiki> ''x'' \u2013 ''y'' <nowiki>|</nowiki>}} (usual [[absolute value]]) || '''R''' || {{math|1/''n''}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''Q'''}} \n|| obtained using the [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuation]], for a prime number {{math|''p''}}\n|| {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} ([[p-adic number|{{math|''p''}}-adic numbers]])\n|| {{math|''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|-\n| {{math|''F''(''t'')}}<br/> ({{math|''F''}} any field)\n|| obtained using the {{math|''t''}}-adic valuation\n|| {{math|''F''((''t''))}}\n|| {{math|''t''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|}\n\nThe field {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used in number theory and [[p-adic analysis|{{math|''p''}}-adic analysis]]. The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that {{harvtxt|Cassels|1986|loc=p. vi}} calls them \"completely anomalous\".</ref>\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic zero)\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, the field of Laurent series over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic {{math|''p''}}).\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F''  \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem. For the same reason, they both have characteristic zero. Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function  {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}</ref> For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H<sup>2</sup>(''F'', '''G'''<sub>m</sub>)}}.\n\n===K-theory===\n[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as\n:<math>K_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.</math>\nThe [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\n:<math>K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).</math>\n[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}. They are used in computer graphics.]]\nIf {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}, then the [[equation]] \n:{{math|1=''ax'' = ''b''}}\nhas a unique solution {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}}, namely {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''/''a''}}. This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of  [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical.

Several systems for classifying the individual diatom [[species]] exist. [[Fossil]] evidence suggests that diatoms originated during or before the early [[Jurassic period]], which was about 150 to 200 million years ago.\n\nDiatoms are used to monitor past and present environmental conditions, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.  [[Diatomaceous earth]] (diatomite) is a collection of diatom shells found in the earth's crust.

This material is then extruded to the cell exterior and added to the wall. In most species, when a diatom divides to produce two daughter cells, each cell keeps one of the two-halves and grows a smaller half within it. As a result, after each division cycle, the average size of diatom cells in the population gets smaller. Once such cells reach a certain minimum size, rather than simply divide, they reverse this decline by forming an [[auxospore]]. This expands in size to give rise to a much larger cell, which then returns to size-diminishing divisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Auxospore production is almost always linked to [[meiosis]] and sexual reproduction.\n\nThe exact mechanism of transferring [[silica]] absorbed by the diatom to the [[cell wall]] is unknown. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from the search for the mechanism of silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the [[frustule]]. The most success in this area has come from two species, ''[[Thalassiosira pseudonana]]'', which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and ''Cylindrotheca fusiformis'', in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered.<ref name=\"hildebrand06\">{{cite journal|last1=Thamatrakoln|first1=K.|title=Comparative Sequence Analysis of Diatom Silicon Transporters: Toward a Mechanistic Model of Silicon Transport|last2=Alverson|first2=A.J.|last3=Hildebrand|first3=M.|journal=Journal of Phycology|date=2006|volume=42|issue=4|pages=822\u2013834|doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00233.x}}</ref> Silaffins, sets of polycationic [[peptides]], were found in ''C. fusiformis'' cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures. These structures demonstrated pores of sizes characteristic to diatom patterns. When ''T. pseudonana'' underwent genome analysis it was found that it encoded a [[urea cycle]], including a higher number of [[polyamines]] than most genomes, as well as three distinct silica transport genes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kr\u00f6ger|first1=Nils|last2=Deutzmann|first2=Rainer|last3=Manfred|first3=Sumper|title=Polycationic Peptides from Diatom Biosilica That Direct Silica Nanosphere Formation.|journal=Science|date=November 1999|volume=286|issue=5442|pages=1129\u20131132|doi=10.1126/science.286.5442.1129|pmid=10550045|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0565467cf2b587d58c3f8be10d4c0452dcf7f42d}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In a [[phylogenetic]] study on silica transport genes from 8 diverse groups of diatoms, silica transport was found to generally group with species.<ref name=\"hildebrand06\" /> This study also found structural differences between the silica transporters of pennate (bilateral symmetry) and centric (radial symmetry) diatoms. The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.\n\nThese silica transport proteins are unique to diatoms, with no [[homologs]] found in other species, such as sponges or rice. The divergence of these silica transport genes is also indicative of the structure of the protein evolving from two repeated units composed of five membrane bound segments, which indicates either gene duplication or [[Protein dimer|dimerization]].<ref name=\"hildebrand06\" /> The silica deposition that takes place from the membrane bound vesicle in diatoms has been hypothesized to be a result of the activity of silaffins and long chain polyamines.  This Silica Deposition Vesicle (SDV) has been characterized as an acidic compartment fused with Golgi-derived vesicles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kroger|first1=Nils|title=Handbook of Biomineralization: Biological Aspects and Structure Formation|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH|location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=chapter 3}}</ref> These two protein structures have been shown to create sheets of patterned silica [[in-vivo]] with irregular pores on the scale of diatom [[frustules]]. One hypothesis as to how these proteins work to create complex structure is that residues are conserved within the SDV's, which is unfortunately difficult to identify or observe due to the limited number of diverse sequences available. Though the exact mechanism of the highly uniform deposition of silica is as yet unknown, the ''Thalassiosira pseudonana'' genes linked to silaffins are being looked to as targets for genetic control of nanoscale silica deposition.\n\n===Urea cycle===\nA feature of diatoms is the [[urea cycle]], which links them evolutionarily to animals. This was discovered in research carried out by Andrew Allen, Chris Bowler and colleagues. Their findings, published in 2011, that diatoms have a functioning urea cycle was highly significant, since prior to this, the urea cycle was thought to have originated with the [[metazoans]] which appeared several hundreds of millions of years after the diatoms. Their study showed that while diatoms and animals use the urea cycle for different ends, they are seen to be evolutionarily linked in such a way that animals and plants are not.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature10074 |pmid=21562560 |laysource=Science Daily |laydate=12 May 2011 |lay-url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110511133553.htm |title=Evolution and metabolic significance of the urea cycle in photosynthetic diatoms |journal=Nature |volume=473 |issue=7346 |pages=203\u20137 |year=2011 |last1=Allen |first1=Andrew E. |last2=Dupont |first2=Christopher L. |last3=Oborn\u00edk |first3=Miroslav |last4=Hor\u00e1k |first4=Ale\u0161 |last5=Nunes-Nesi |first5=Adriano |last6=McCrow |first6=John P. |last7=Zheng |first7=Hong |last8=Johnson |first8=Daniel A. |last9=Hu |first9=Hanhua |last10=Fernie |first10=Alisdair R. |last11=Bowler |first11=Chris |bibcode=2011Natur.473..203A }}</ref>\n\n===Pigments===\nMajor [[pigment]]s of diatoms are [[chlorophylls]] a and c, [[beta-carotene]], [[fucoxanthin]], diatoxanthin and diadinoxanthin.<ref name=\"HasleSyvertsen1996\" />\n\n===Storage products===\nStorage products are [[chrysolaminarin]] and [[lipids]].<ref name=\"Horner2002\" />\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Centric diatom life-cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a centric diatom ([[oogamy]])]]\n[[File:Diatom pennate life cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a pinnate diatom (morphological [[isogamy]], physiological [[anisogamy]])]]\n\n===Reproduction and cell size===\nReproduction among these organisms is asexual by [[binary fission]], during which the diatom divides into two parts, producing two \"new\" diatoms with identical genes.

Each one of their valves have openings that are slits along the [[raphe]]s and their shells are typically elongated parallel to these raphes. They generate cell movement through cytoplasm that streams along the raphes, always moving along solid surfaces.\n\nCentric diatoms are radially symmetric. They are composed of upper and lower valves \u2013 ''epitheca'' and ''hypotheca'' \u2013 each consisting of a valve and a girdle band that can easily slide underneath each other and expand to increase cell content over the diatoms progression. The cytoplasm of the centric diatom is located along the inner surface of the shell and provides a hollow lining around the large vacuole located in the center of the cell. This large, central vacuole is filled by a fluid known as \"cell sap\" which is similar to seawater but varies with specific ion content. The cytoplasmic layer is home to several organelles, like the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Before the centric diatom begins to expand, its nucleus is at the center of one of the valves and begins to move towards the center of the cytoplasmic layer before division is complete. Centric diatoms have a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on from which axis the shell extends, and if spines are present.\n\n[[File:Shape classification of diatom frustules.png|thumb|400px|left| {{center|Shape classification of diatom frustules.

Comparison of the ''T. pseudonana'' proteins with homologs in other organisms suggested that hundreds have their closest homologs in the Plantae lineage. EGT towards diatom genomes can be illustrated by the fact that the ''T. pseudonana'' genome encodes six proteins which are most closely related to genes encoded by the ''[[Guillardia theta]]'' ([[cryptomonad]]) [[nucleomorph]] genome. Four of these genes are also found in red algal plastid genomes, thus demonstrating successive EGT from red algal plastid to red algal nucleus (nucleomorph) to heterokont host nucleus.<ref name=\"armbrust04\" /> More recent [[phylogenomics|phylogenomic analyses]] of diatom proteomes provided evidence for a [[prasinophyte]]-like endosymbiont in the common ancestor of [[chromalveolates]] as supported by the fact the 70% of diatom genes of Plantae origin are of green lineage provenance and that such genes are also found in the genome of other [[stramenopile]]s. Therefore, it was proposed that chromalveolates are the product of serial secondary [[endosymbiosis]] first with a [[green algae]], followed by a second one with a [[red algae]] that conserved the genomic footprints of the previous but displaced the green plastid.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1172983 |pmid=19556510 |title=Genomic Footprints of a Cryptic Plastid Endosymbiosis in Diatoms |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5935 |pages=1724\u20136 |year=2009 |last1=Moustafa |first1=A. |last2=Beszteri |first2=B. |last3=Maier |first3=U.

The publication of the ''P. tricornutum'' genome reported that at least 587 ''P. tricornutum'' genes appear to be most closely related to bacterial genes, accounting for more than 5% of the ''P. tricornutum'' proteome.

This sinking is induced by either a loss of buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy ''resting spores''. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell [[metabolism]]). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the [[thermocline]].\n\nUltimately, diatom cells in these resting populations re-enter the upper mixed layer when vertical mixing entrains them. In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients in the upper mixed layer, setting the scene for the next round of diatom blooms. In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous [[upwelling]]<ref name=dugdale98>{{cite journal | last1 = Dugdale | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Wilkerson | first2 = F.

In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.\n\nIn the open ocean, the diatom (spring) bloom is typically ended by a shortage of silicon. Unlike other minerals, the requirement for silicon is unique to diatoms and it is not regenerated in the plankton ecosystem as efficiently as, for instance, [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]] nutrients. This can be seen in maps of surface nutrient concentrations \u2013 as nutrients decline along gradients, silicon is usually the first to be exhausted (followed normally by nitrogen then phosphorus).\n\nBecause of this bloom-and-bust cycle, diatoms are believed to play a disproportionately important role in the export of carbon from oceanic surface waters<ref name=dugdale98 /><ref name=smetacek85>{{cite journal | last1 = Smetacek | first1 = V.

Several systems for classifying the individual diatom [[species]] exist. [[Fossil]] evidence suggests that diatoms originated during or before the early [[Jurassic period]], which was about 150 to 200 million years ago.\n\nDiatoms are used to monitor past and present environmental conditions, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.  [[Diatomaceous earth]] (diatomite) is a collection of diatom shells found in the earth's crust. They are soft, silica-containing sedimentary rocks which are easily crumbled into a fine powder and typically have a particle size of 10 to 200 \u03bcm.

This material is then extruded to the cell exterior and added to the wall. In most species, when a diatom divides to produce two daughter cells, each cell keeps one of the two-halves and grows a smaller half within it. As a result, after each division cycle, the average size of diatom cells in the population gets smaller. Once such cells reach a certain minimum size, rather than simply divide, they reverse this decline by forming an [[auxospore]]. This expands in size to give rise to a much larger cell, which then returns to size-diminishing divisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Auxospore production is almost always linked to [[meiosis]] and sexual reproduction.\n\nThe exact mechanism of transferring [[silica]] absorbed by the diatom to the [[cell wall]] is unknown. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from the search for the mechanism of silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the [[frustule]]. The most success in this area has come from two species, ''[[Thalassiosira pseudonana]]'', which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and ''Cylindrotheca fusiformis'', in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered.<ref name=\"hildebrand06\">{{cite journal|last1=Thamatrakoln|first1=K.|title=Comparative Sequence Analysis of Diatom Silicon Transporters: Toward a Mechanistic Model of Silicon Transport|last2=Alverson|first2=A.J.|last3=Hildebrand|first3=M.|journal=Journal of Phycology|date=2006|volume=42|issue=4|pages=822\u2013834|doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00233.x}}</ref> Silaffins, sets of polycationic [[peptides]], were found in ''C. fusiformis'' cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures.

The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.\n\nThese silica transport proteins are unique to diatoms, with no [[homologs]] found in other species, such as sponges or rice. The divergence of these silica transport genes is also indicative of the structure of the protein evolving from two repeated units composed of five membrane bound segments, which indicates either gene duplication or [[Protein dimer|dimerization]].<ref name=\"hildebrand06\" /> The silica deposition that takes place from the membrane bound vesicle in diatoms has been hypothesized to be a result of the activity of silaffins and long chain polyamines.  This Silica Deposition Vesicle (SDV) has been characterized as an acidic compartment fused with Golgi-derived vesicles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kroger|first1=Nils|title=Handbook of Biomineralization: Biological Aspects and Structure Formation|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH|location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=chapter 3}}</ref> These two protein structures have been shown to create sheets of patterned silica [[in-vivo]] with irregular pores on the scale of diatom [[frustules]]. One hypothesis as to how these proteins work to create complex structure is that residues are conserved within the SDV's, which is unfortunately difficult to identify or observe due to the limited number of diverse sequences available. Though the exact mechanism of the highly uniform deposition of silica is as yet unknown, the ''Thalassiosira pseudonana'' genes linked to silaffins are being looked to as targets for genetic control of nanoscale silica deposition.\n\n===Urea cycle===\nA feature of diatoms is the [[urea cycle]], which links them evolutionarily to animals. This was discovered in research carried out by Andrew Allen, Chris Bowler and colleagues. Their findings, published in 2011, that diatoms have a functioning urea cycle was highly significant, since prior to this, the urea cycle was thought to have originated with the [[metazoans]] which appeared several hundreds of millions of years after the diatoms. Their study showed that while diatoms and animals use the urea cycle for different ends, they are seen to be evolutionarily linked in such a way that animals and plants are not.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature10074 |pmid=21562560 |laysource=Science Daily |laydate=12 May 2011 |lay-url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110511133553.htm |title=Evolution and metabolic significance of the urea cycle in photosynthetic diatoms |journal=Nature |volume=473 |issue=7346 |pages=203\u20137 |year=2011 |last1=Allen |first1=Andrew E. |last2=Dupont |first2=Christopher L. |last3=Oborn\u00edk |first3=Miroslav |last4=Hor\u00e1k |first4=Ale\u0161 |last5=Nunes-Nesi |first5=Adriano |last6=McCrow |first6=John P. |last7=Zheng |first7=Hong |last8=Johnson |first8=Daniel A. |last9=Hu |first9=Hanhua |last10=Fernie |first10=Alisdair R. |last11=Bowler |first11=Chris |bibcode=2011Natur.473..203A }}</ref>\n\n===Pigments===\nMajor [[pigment]]s of diatoms are [[chlorophylls]] a and c, [[beta-carotene]], [[fucoxanthin]], diatoxanthin and diadinoxanthin.<ref name=\"HasleSyvertsen1996\" />\n\n===Storage products===\nStorage products are [[chrysolaminarin]] and [[lipids]].<ref name=\"Horner2002\" />\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Centric diatom life-cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a centric diatom ([[oogamy]])]]\n[[File:Diatom pennate life cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a pinnate diatom (morphological [[isogamy]], physiological [[anisogamy]])]]\n\n===Reproduction and cell size===\nReproduction among these organisms is asexual by [[binary fission]], during which the diatom divides into two parts, producing two \"new\" diatoms with identical genes.

The zygote sheds its silica theca and grows into a large sphere covered by an organic membrane, the auxospore.

Each one of their valves have openings that are slits along the [[raphe]]s and their shells are typically elongated parallel to these raphes. They generate cell movement through cytoplasm that streams along the raphes, always moving along solid surfaces.\n\nCentric diatoms are radially symmetric. They are composed of upper and lower valves \u2013 ''epitheca'' and ''hypotheca'' \u2013 each consisting of a valve and a girdle band that can easily slide underneath each other and expand to increase cell content over the diatoms progression. The cytoplasm of the centric diatom is located along the inner surface of the shell and provides a hollow lining around the large vacuole located in the center of the cell. This large, central vacuole is filled by a fluid known as \"cell sap\" which is similar to seawater but varies with specific ion content. The cytoplasmic layer is home to several organelles, like the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Before the centric diatom begins to expand, its nucleus is at the center of one of the valves and begins to move towards the center of the cytoplasmic layer before division is complete. Centric diatoms have a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on from which axis the shell extends, and if spines are present.\n\n[[File:Shape classification of diatom frustules.png|thumb|400px|left| {{center|Shape classification of diatom frustules.

Comparison of the ''T. pseudonana'' proteins with homologs in other organisms suggested that hundreds have their closest homologs in the Plantae lineage. EGT towards diatom genomes can be illustrated by the fact that the ''T. pseudonana'' genome encodes six proteins which are most closely related to genes encoded by the ''[[Guillardia theta]]'' ([[cryptomonad]]) [[nucleomorph]] genome.

This sinking is induced by either a loss of buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy ''resting spores''. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell [[metabolism]]). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the [[thermocline]].\n\nUltimately, diatom cells in these resting populations re-enter the upper mixed layer when vertical mixing entrains them. In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients in the upper mixed layer, setting the scene for the next round of diatom blooms. In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous [[upwelling]]<ref name=dugdale98>{{cite journal | last1 = Dugdale | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Wilkerson | first2 = F. P. | year = 1998 | title = Silicate regulation of new production in the equatorial Pacific upwelling | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6664| pages = 270\u2013273 | doi=10.1038/34630|bibcode = 1998Natur.391..270D }}</ref>), this cycle of bloom, bust, then return to pre-bloom conditions typically occurs over an annual cycle, with diatoms only being prevalent during the spring and early summer. In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.\n\nIn the open ocean, the diatom (spring) bloom is typically ended by a shortage of silicon. Unlike other minerals, the requirement for silicon is unique to diatoms and it is not regenerated in the plankton ecosystem as efficiently as, for instance, [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]] nutrients. This can be seen in maps of surface nutrient concentrations \u2013 as nutrients decline along gradients, silicon is usually the first to be exhausted (followed normally by nitrogen then phosphorus).\n\nBecause of this bloom-and-bust cycle, diatoms are believed to play a disproportionately important role in the export of carbon from oceanic surface waters<ref name=dugdale98 /><ref name=smetacek85>{{cite journal | last1 = Smetacek | first1 = V.

More generally, notwithstanding these possible advantages conferred by their use of silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of the same corresponding size.<ref name=furnas90 />\n\n===Sources for collection===\nDiatoms may be obtained from multiple sources.<ref name=chamberlain1901>Chamberlain, C.

The surface mud of a pond, ditch, or lagoon will almost always yield some diatoms.\n\n====Algae and plants====\nLiving diatoms are often found clinging in great numbers to filamentous algae, or forming gelatinous masses on various submerged plants. ''[[Cladophora]]'' is frequently covered with ''[[Cocconeis]]'', an elliptically shaped diatom; ''[[Vaucheria]]'' is often covered with small forms.\n\n====Animal alimentary tracts====\nSince diatoms form an important part of the food of [[mollusc]]s, [[tunicate]]s, and [[fish]]es, the [[alimentary tract]]s of these animals often yield forms that are not easily secured in other ways.\n\n====Cultivation====\nDiatoms can be made to emerge by filling a jar with water and mud, wrapping it in black paper and letting direct sunlight fall on the surface of the water. Within a day, the diatoms will come to the top in a scum and can be isolated.\n\n==Human uses==\n===Paleontology===\nDecomposition and decay of diatoms leads to [[organic matter|organic]] and [[inorganic]] (in the form of [[silicate]]s) sediment, the inorganic component of which can lead to a method of analyzing past marine environments by corings of ocean floors or [[bay mud]]s, since the inorganic matter is embedded in deposition of [[clay]]s and [[silt]]s and forms a permanent geological record of such marine strata.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{USD}}80 million.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[Japanese role-playing game]]s worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an upcoming [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[Fixed width font|fixed-width font]] and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old comic book '@#$%!'-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans. Square subsequently stated that it would never allow Sony to localize the game in any way.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Colin|last=Campbell|title=Final Fantasy Mania |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1997|page=30}}</ref> In addition to translating the text, the North American localization team made tweaks to the gameplay, including reducing the enemy encounter rate, simplifying the Materia menu, and adding new boss fights.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Bro Buzz|title=Final Fantasy VII Update! |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=107|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=August 1997|page=86}}</ref>\n\n===Later releases===\nThe ''International'' version of ''Final Fantasy VII'' was released on [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN) as a PSOne Classic in Japan on April 10, 2009.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{USD}}80 million.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[Japanese role-playing game]]s worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English [[Language localisation|localization]]. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', and an upcoming [[Final Fantasy VII Remake|high-definition remake]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Gameplay}}\nThe gameplay of ''Final Fantasy VII'' is mostly comparable to earlier ''Final Fantasy'' titles and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing games]].<ref name=\"gamespotps1\">{{cite web|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |title=Final Fantasy VII Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2017 |language=en |date=September 29, 1997 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021090337/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-review/1900-2547583/ |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref> The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen.<ref name=\"All Game\"/><ref name=ps1manual>{{Cite book| year=1997 | author=Square Co.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable.

Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair.

While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''.

This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project.<ref name=\"FFVIIhistory\"/> The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and ''[[True Lies]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=April 1994 |title=You Should Know This Game: Final Fantasy VII |magazine=Computer and Video Games |issue=185 |page=88 |publisher=[[Future plc]] |url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n87/mode/2up |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317043635/https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_185_1997-04_EMAP_Images_GB |archivedate=March 17, 2016 }}</ref> The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending.

Square accepted Sony's offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game's success, as other JRPGs including ''Final Fantasy VI'' had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> It was first exhibited to the Western public at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996]] (E3).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|title=PlayStation at E3: 1996|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|publisher=[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928230514/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/06/03/playstation-at-e3-1996/|archivedate=September 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[Fixed width font|fixed-width font]] and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old comic book '@#$%!'-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]<ref>FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111033236/http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf |date=11 January 2014 }}</ref> and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s.

Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | website = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crop diversity ===\n\nOrganic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]].

This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]], allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change .\n\n[[Plant nutrition|Plants need]] a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough [[nitrogen]] and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the when plants need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers.<ref name=SoilFertility>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239\u2013247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x | url = http://orgprints.org/8060/2/Watson_orgprints_8060.pdf }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].</ref> [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] (\"[[cover crop]]s\") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the family [[Fabaceae]]), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.<ref name=SoilFertility/> Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.<ref name=Gillman2008/>{{Rp|43}}\n\nMixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\"stockless\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.<ref name=SoilFertility/>\n\nBiological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming.

Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526|title=Agricultural Marketing Service|website=www.ams.usda.gov|access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref> These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic.\n\nOrganic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.<ref>FAO [http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/230124/CXg_032e.pdf Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing of Organically Produced Foods (Gl 32 \u2013 1999, Rev. 1 \u2013 2001)]</ref>{{rp|19ff}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateN&navID=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&rightNav1=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&topNav=&leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&page=NOPOrganicStandards&resultType=&acct=nopgeninfo|title=Organic Standards - Agricultural Marketing Service|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAlso, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labor, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}\n\nA key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.\n\nAlthough opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256\u2013258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}</ref> Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist [[Pamela Ronald]] write that many agricultural applications of [[biotechnology]] are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2018 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Adamchak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=978-0199342082 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].\n\n=== Tools ===\n\nOrganic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Organic certification}}\nStandards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}</ref> which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).<ref>USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.</ref> As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.<ref>IFOAM. (2005). [http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html The IFOAM Norms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210095156/http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html |date=10 February 2006 }}</ref> Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms.\n\nProduction materials used for the creation of USDA Organic certified foods require the approval of a NOP accredited certifier.\n\n=== Composting ===\nUsing manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including pathogenic strains of E. coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food.<ref name=newdaily>{{cite web|url=https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/eat-drink/2014/08/29/hidden-dangers-organic-food/|title=Organic food: the hidden dangers that might surprise you|date=29 August 2014|website=The New Daily}}</ref> To combat this risk, [[USDA]] organic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperature [[Composting#Approaches|thermophilic composting]]. If raw animal manure is used, 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products that don't directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|title=National Organic Program Regulations|access-date=27 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211185453/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|archive-date=11 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA,) as amended, specifies that a farm can not be certified as organic if the compost being used  contains any synthetic ingredients.

Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.<ref name=Misconcept/>\n\nTraditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.<ref name=Halberg>{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}</ref>\n\nOrganic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.<ref>Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.

First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.\n\nThe price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits.

Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.<ref name=\":1\" /> Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.<ref name=\"Agricultural Marketing Service 2016\">\"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation\"(PDF).

Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]<ref>FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111033236/http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf |date=11 January 2014 }}</ref> and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s.

This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]], allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change .\n\n[[Plant nutrition|Plants need]] a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough [[nitrogen]] and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the when plants need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers.<ref name=SoilFertility>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239\u2013247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x | url = http://orgprints.org/8060/2/Watson_orgprints_8060.pdf }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].</ref> [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] (\"[[cover crop]]s\") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the family [[Fabaceae]]), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.<ref name=SoilFertility/> Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.<ref name=Gillman2008/>{{Rp|43}}\n\nMixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\"stockless\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested.

While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}\n\nA key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.\n\nAlthough opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256\u2013258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}</ref> Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist [[Pamela Ronald]] write that many agricultural applications of [[biotechnology]] are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2018 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Adamchak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=978-0199342082 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].\n\n=== Tools ===\n\nOrganic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Organic certification}}\nStandards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}</ref> which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).<ref>USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.</ref> As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.<ref>IFOAM. (2005).

Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.<ref name=Misconcept/>\n\nTraditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.<ref name=Halberg>{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}</ref>\n\nOrganic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.<ref>Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.

First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.\n\nThe price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Prices|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants.

These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.<ref name=\"E&S\">[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture-and-post-2015-development-goals.]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Setboonsarng, S. \"Organic Agriculture, Poverty Reduction, Climate Change, and the Millennium Development Goals\".

The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">World Bank. 2008.

Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.<ref name=\":1\" /> Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.<ref name=\"Agricultural Marketing Service 2016\">\"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation\"(PDF).

The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labor practices.
