However deep difference between the princely states and the Congress, as well as between the Muslim League and Congress, had delayed progress. Instead, only the provincial portion of the Act was carried out.\n\nFollowing Britain's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, the Viceroy, [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Linlithgow]], responded by declaring India a belligerent state on the side of Britain without consulting Indian political leaders or the elected provincial representatives, sharply underlining the failure of progress to self-rule.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63KMRN1SJ8C&pg=PA47|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=47|isbn=9780521458504}}</ref>  This caused considerable resentment in the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], producing demands for an immediate transfer of power. The resulting standoff led to the en masse resignation of Congress Provincial Governments, giving rise to the prospect of public revolt and political disorder in India. The [[All-India Muslim League|All India Muslim League]], the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] as well as regional parties, gave their support to Britain and the war effort in exchange for various concessions. Negotiations continued between the Viceroy, Congress and Muslim League but their failure led to a political stalemate.\n\nThe Japanese declaration of war on the Dutch and British empires as well as the United States in December 1941 altered the political situation.  Confidence in Britain was particularly low after the [[fall of Singapore]] on 15 February 1942, Britain's greatest single defeat in the war, as fell as the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|retreat from Rangoon]], with large numbers of [[British Indian Army during World War II|Indian Army]] troops captured. The threat of an invasion of India was real, and there was anxiety about 'fifth columnists,' particularly Congress radicals working with Japan.\n\nThe British war cabinet, a coalition government of national unity, was divided on the question of compromise with the Congress. The Labour Party ministers and moderate Conservatives were keen to advance Indian progress to self-government in a way that would not endanger the war effort. Churchill was deeply opposed to any dismantling of the British Empire, regarding its non-white subjects as incapable of self-rule; in fact the stridency of his views, and his opposition to Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s agreement to work with parties such as the [[Indian National Congress]] towards self-rule had contributed to his isolation within the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for a decade. He was supported in his views by the Conservative [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Leo Amery]].\n\nHowever, the United States, as Britain's principal ally saw things in even more urgent terms. The chief American strategic objective was aiding [[Chiang Kai Shek]]'s physically isolated [[Republic of China|Nationalist China]] against the expanding [[Japanese Empire]]. The Japanese [[Second Sino-Japanese War|conquest of China's coastal areas]] meant that the US needed India to serve as a major logistical hub to funnel aid to China, and needed Indian military manpower to secure routes for supplies through [[Burma]]. American as well as Chinese leadership was convinced that this would not be possible without the full support of a mobilised Indian population, requiring a breakthrough with the Indian National Congress. In addition the Roosevelt administration which was busy formulating its vision for the post-war world order saw the [[decolonisation of Asia]] as a matter of US national interest for both ideological as well as commercial reasons.\n\nDespite these conflicts of interests, Britain's reliance on the United States for [[Lend-Lease]] supplies for the war effort meant that President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s pressure had to at least appear to be taken seriously, especially in light of the military disasters in South East Asia. As a result, the British cabinet by 9 March 1942 agreed to despatch a mission to India to discuss its offer, and Cripps' plane landed in Delhi on 22 March.

Others, such as [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]], advocated offering an olive branch to the British, supporting them in this crucial time in the hope that the gesture would be reciprocated with independence after the war. The major leader, [[Mahatma Gandhi]], was opposed to Indian involvement in the war as he would not morally endorse a war and also suspected British intentions, believing that the British were not sincere about Indian aspirations for independence.

But the level of suspicion was simply too high, and too many influential figures did not want the negotiations to succeed.}}</ref> There is some confusion over what Cripps had been authorised to offer India's nationalist politicians by Churchill and [[Leo Amery]] (His Majesty's [[Secretary of State for India]]), and he also faced hostility from the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow. He began by offering India full [[dominion]] status at the end of the war, with the chance to secede from the [[Commonwealth]] and go for total independence. Privately, Cripps also promised to get rid of Linlithgow and grant India Dominion Status with immediate effect, insisting only that the Indian Defence Ministry be reserved for the British.\n\nHowever, in public, he failed to present any concrete proposals for greater self-government in the short term, other than a vague commitment to increase the number of Indian members of the [[Viceroy's Executive Council]]. Cripps spent much of his time in encouraging Congress leaders and Jinnah to come to a common, public arrangement in support of the war and government.\n\nThere was little trust between the British and Congress by this stage, and both sides felt that the other was concealing its true plans. The Congress stopped talks with Cripps and, guided by Gandhi, the national leadership demanded immediate self-government in return for war support. Gandhi said that Cripps' offer of Dominion Status after the war was a \"post-dated cheque drawn on a failing bank By pihal\n\n==Muslim League reception==\nThe Muslim League rejected the Cripps proposal. Jinnah argued that the proposals were merely a draft declaration and did not meet the demand for Pakistan sufficiently and preferred a scheme of United India. At a press conference on April he argued that there was no clear concession for Pakistan in the proposals and he further expressed concern that the Muslim right to self-determination had been ignored. He also expressed criticism for the exclusion of the Muslim League from the later stage of negotiations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Akhtar Hussain|title=Cripps Mission Proposals And Muslim-Sikh Relations on the British Punjab|journal=Journal of the Resarch Society of Pakistan|volume=48|issue=1|page=12|quote=The Congress on 2 April 1942 signalled its opposition to the Cripps Proposals. The Congress and Sikhs rejected these proposals due to the possibility of the India's partition with the provision that provinces could opt out of a future Indian Constituent Assembly while the League rejected it finding no clear-cut acceptance of Pakistan. Quaid-i-Azam expressed his dismay at the refusal to recognise the right of Muslim self determination while addressing the annual session of the All India Muslim League at Allahabad: '...the Musalmans feel deeply disappointed that the entity ad integrity of the Muslim nation has not been expressly recognised...Muslim India will not be satisfied unless the right of national self determination is unequivocally recognised. It must be realised that India was never a country or a nation....It has roused our deepest anxieties and grave apprehensions, especially with reference to the Pakistan scheme, which is a matter of life and death for Muslim India...'}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abid|first1=Massarrat|title=Partition Demand: From Cripps Mission to Gandhi-Jinnah Talks|journal=Journal of Pakistan Vision|date=31 December 2010|volume=11|issue=2|quote=On 29 March, Cripps released his documents and held a press conference. On 4 April, in his presidential address to the Muslim League, Jinnah pointed out that Cripps proposals were only a draft declaration. He also said that creation of Pakistan was a remote possibility and there was a definite preference for a new Indian Union which was the main objective and suggestion and the draft declaration interviews and explanations of Sir Stafford were going against Muslim interests and the League was called upon to play the game with a loaded dice. He asked Cripps to make adjustments in order to give real effect to the Pakistan demand. On 13 April 1942, at a press conference, he pointed out that Pakistan demand was not conceded clearly and the right of Muslims to self determination was also denied. These proposals were therefore rejected by the Muslim League. Jinnah criticized the British Government and Congress party for another round of negotiations, ignoring the Muslim League at a later stage.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_0LBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT81|date=28 April 1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-93570-8|pages=81\u2013|quote=Provincial option, he argued, was clearly an insufficient security. An explicit acceptance of the principle of Pakistan offered the only safeguard for Muslim interests throughout India and had to be the precondition for any advance at the centre. So he exhorted all Indian Muslims to unite under his leadership to force the British and the Congress to concede 'Pakistan'. If the real reasons for Jinnah's rejection of the offer were rather different, it was not Jinnah but his rivals who had failed to make the point publicly.}}</ref>\n\n==Quit India Movement==\nWhen the British remained unresponsive, Gandhi and the Indian National Congress began planning a major public revolt, the [[Quit India movement]], which demanded immediate British withdrawal from India. As the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] advanced closer to India with the conquest of [[Burma]], Indians perceived an inability upon the part of the British to defend Indian soil. The invasion force contained elements of the [[Indian National Army]], founded and led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] to end British control of India. It was composed of Indians, most being prisoners captured with the fall of Singapore in early 1942. The British response to the Quit India movement was to jail most of the Congress leadership.\n\nJinnah's Muslim League condemned the Quit India movement and participated in provincial governments as well as the legislative councils of the Raj. It encouraged Muslims to participate in the war. With this cooperation, the British were able to continue administering India for the duration of the war using officials and military personnel where Indian politicians could not be found. This would not prove to be feasible in the long term, however.\n\n==Causes of failure==\nThere are three main reasons behind the causes of the failure of the Cripps' mission. They are listed as follows:\n* Gandhi's opposition led the Indian National Congress to reject the British offer.\n* Cripps' modification of the original British offer, which provided for no real transfer of power.\n* the behind-the-scenes efforts of the Viceroy and Secretary of State for India to sabotage the mission.\nGupta<ref>Shyam Ratna Gupta, \"New Light on the Cripps Mission,\" ''India Quarterly,'' (Jan 1972), 28#1 pp 69-74</ref> concludes that documents released in 1970 support the third interpretation. Messages between Viceroy Lord Linlithgow and Secretary of State L. S. S. Amery reveal that both opposed the Cripps Mission and that they deliberately undercut Cripps. While the British government used the Cripps Mission as evidence of its liberal colonial policy, personal and private correspondence reveals contempt for the mission and elation over its failure.<ref>Shyam Ratna Gupta, \"New Light on the Cripps Mission,\" ''India Quarterly,'' (Jan 1972), 28#1 pp 69-74.</ref>\n\n==Long-term impact==\nThe long-term significance of the Cripps Mission really became apparent only in the aftermath of the war, as troops were demobilised and sent back home. Even Churchill recognised that there could be no retraction of the offer of independence which Cripps had made, but by the end of the war, Churchill was out of power and could do nothing but watch as the new Labour government gave India independence. This confidence that the British would soon leave was reflected in the readiness with which Congress politicians stood in the elections of 1945\u20131946 and formed provincial governments.<ref>Judith Brown ''Modern India.

The mission was headed by a senior minister [[Sir Stafford Cripps]]. Cripps belonged to the left-wing [[British Labour party|Labour Party]], traditionally sympathetic to Indian self-rule, but was also a member of the coalition War Cabinet led by the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who had long been the leader of the movement to block Indian independence.\n\nCripps was sent to negotiate an agreement with the nationalist [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] leaders, who spoke for the majority Indians and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], who spoke for the minority Muslim population comprising 35% of the total population. Cripps worked to keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for a promise of elections and full self-government ([[Dominion status]]) once the war was over. Cripps discussed the proposals, which he had drafted himself with the Indian leaders, and published them. Both the major parties rejected his proposals, and they were also unacceptable to Churchill; no middle way was found and the mission failed. Congress moved towards the [[Quit India]] movement whereby it refused to cooperate in the war effort; in response, the British imprisoned practically the entire Congress leadership for the duration of the war.

But the level of suspicion was simply too high, and too many influential figures did not want the negotiations to succeed.}}</ref> There is some confusion over what Cripps had been authorised to offer India's nationalist politicians by Churchill and [[Leo Amery]] (His Majesty's [[Secretary of State for India]]), and he also faced hostility from the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow. He began by offering India full [[dominion]] status at the end of the war, with the chance to secede from the [[Commonwealth]] and go for total independence. Privately, Cripps also promised to get rid of Linlithgow and grant India Dominion Status with immediate effect, insisting only that the Indian Defence Ministry be reserved for the British.\n\nHowever, in public, he failed to present any concrete proposals for greater self-government in the short term, other than a vague commitment to increase the number of Indian members of the [[Viceroy's Executive Council]]. Cripps spent much of his time in encouraging Congress leaders and Jinnah to come to a common, public arrangement in support of the war and government.\n\nThere was little trust between the British and Congress by this stage, and both sides felt that the other was concealing its true plans. The Congress stopped talks with Cripps and, guided by Gandhi, the national leadership demanded immediate self-government in return for war support. Gandhi said that Cripps' offer of Dominion Status after the war was a \"post-dated cheque drawn on a failing bank By pihal\n\n==Muslim League reception==\nThe Muslim League rejected the Cripps proposal. Jinnah argued that the proposals were merely a draft declaration and did not meet the demand for Pakistan sufficiently and preferred a scheme of United India. At a press conference on April he argued that there was no clear concession for Pakistan in the proposals and he further expressed concern that the Muslim right to self-determination had been ignored. He also expressed criticism for the exclusion of the Muslim League from the later stage of negotiations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Akhtar Hussain|title=Cripps Mission Proposals And Muslim-Sikh Relations on the British Punjab|journal=Journal of the Resarch Society of Pakistan|volume=48|issue=1|page=12|quote=The Congress on 2 April 1942 signalled its opposition to the Cripps Proposals. The Congress and Sikhs rejected these proposals due to the possibility of the India's partition with the provision that provinces could opt out of a future Indian Constituent Assembly while the League rejected it finding no clear-cut acceptance of Pakistan. Quaid-i-Azam expressed his dismay at the refusal to recognise the right of Muslim self determination while addressing the annual session of the All India Muslim League at Allahabad: '...the Musalmans feel deeply disappointed that the entity ad integrity of the Muslim nation has not been expressly recognised...Muslim India will not be satisfied unless the right of national self determination is unequivocally recognised. It must be realised that India was never a country or a nation....It has roused our deepest anxieties and grave apprehensions, especially with reference to the Pakistan scheme, which is a matter of life and death for Muslim India...'}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abid|first1=Massarrat|title=Partition Demand: From Cripps Mission to Gandhi-Jinnah Talks|journal=Journal of Pakistan Vision|date=31 December 2010|volume=11|issue=2|quote=On 29 March, Cripps released his documents and held a press conference. On 4 April, in his presidential address to the Muslim League, Jinnah pointed out that Cripps proposals were only a draft declaration. He also said that creation of Pakistan was a remote possibility and there was a definite preference for a new Indian Union which was the main objective and suggestion and the draft declaration interviews and explanations of Sir Stafford were going against Muslim interests and the League was called upon to play the game with a loaded dice. He asked Cripps to make adjustments in order to give real effect to the Pakistan demand. On 13 April 1942, at a press conference, he pointed out that Pakistan demand was not conceded clearly and the right of Muslims to self determination was also denied. These proposals were therefore rejected by the Muslim League. Jinnah criticized the British Government and Congress party for another round of negotiations, ignoring the Muslim League at a later stage.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_0LBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT81|date=28 April 1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-93570-8|pages=81\u2013|quote=Provincial option, he argued, was clearly an insufficient security. An explicit acceptance of the principle of Pakistan offered the only safeguard for Muslim interests throughout India and had to be the precondition for any advance at the centre. So he exhorted all Indian Muslims to unite under his leadership to force the British and the Congress to concede 'Pakistan'. If the real reasons for Jinnah's rejection of the offer were rather different, it was not Jinnah but his rivals who had failed to make the point publicly.}}</ref>\n\n==Quit India Movement==\nWhen the British remained unresponsive, Gandhi and the Indian National Congress began planning a major public revolt, the [[Quit India movement]], which demanded immediate British withdrawal from India. As the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] advanced closer to India with the conquest of [[Burma]], Indians perceived an inability upon the part of the British to defend Indian soil. The invasion force contained elements of the [[Indian National Army]], founded and led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] to end British control of India. It was composed of Indians, most being prisoners captured with the fall of Singapore in early 1942. The British response to the Quit India movement was to jail most of the Congress leadership.\n\nJinnah's Muslim League condemned the Quit India movement and participated in provincial governments as well as the legislative councils of the Raj. It encouraged Muslims to participate in the war. With this cooperation, the British were able to continue administering India for the duration of the war using officials and military personnel where Indian politicians could not be found. This would not prove to be feasible in the long term, however.\n\n==Causes of failure==\nThere are three main reasons behind the causes of the failure of the Cripps' mission. They are listed as follows:\n* Gandhi's opposition led the Indian National Congress to reject the British offer.\n* Cripps' modification of the original British offer, which provided for no real transfer of power.\n* the behind-the-scenes efforts of the Viceroy and Secretary of State for India to sabotage the mission.\nGupta<ref>Shyam Ratna Gupta, \"New Light on the Cripps Mission,\" ''India Quarterly,'' (Jan 1972), 28#1 pp 69-74</ref> concludes that documents released in 1970 support the third interpretation. Messages between Viceroy Lord Linlithgow and Secretary of State L. S. S. Amery reveal that both opposed the Cripps Mission and that they deliberately undercut Cripps. While the British government used the Cripps Mission as evidence of its liberal colonial policy, personal and private correspondence reveals contempt for the mission and elation over its failure.<ref>Shyam Ratna Gupta, \"New Light on the Cripps Mission,\" ''India Quarterly,'' (Jan 1972), 28#1 pp 69-74.</ref>\n\n==Long-term impact==\nThe long-term significance of the Cripps Mission really became apparent only in the aftermath of the war, as troops were demobilised and sent back home. Even Churchill recognised that there could be no retraction of the offer of independence which Cripps had made, but by the end of the war, Churchill was out of power and could do nothing but watch as the new Labour government gave India independence. This confidence that the British would soon leave was reflected in the readiness with which Congress politicians stood in the elections of 1945\u20131946 and formed provincial governments.<ref>Judith Brown ''Modern India.

See Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> With the Confederates continuing to advance, Wallace led a second brigade to the right and engaged the Confederates with infantry and artillery. Wallace's decision stopped their forward movement and was key in stabilizing a defensive line for the Union troops. After the Confederate assault had been checked, Wallace led a counterattack that regained the lost ground on the Union right.<ref>Stephens, p. 62; Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> On March 21, 1862, Wallace, McClernand, and C.

Gen. Grant.\n\nWhat was to become a long-standing controversy developed around the contents of Wallace's written orders on April 6, the 3rd Division's movements on the first day of battle, and their late arrival on the field.<ref>Ferraro, p. 129; Stephens, p. 84.</ref> On the second day of battle, Wallace's division joined reinforcements from Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army to play an important role in the Union victory.<ref>Boomhower, p. 7.</ref> Prior to the battle, Wallace's division had been left in reserve and was encamped near Crump's Landing. Their orders were to guard the Union's right flank and cover the road to Bethel Station, Tennessee, where railroad lines led to [[Corinth, Mississippi]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the south.<ref>Stephens, pp. 65, 72; Ferraro, p. 128.</ref> To protect the road from Crump's Landing and Bethel Station, Wallace sent Col. [[John Milton Thayer|John M. Thayer]]'s 2nd Brigade to Stoney Lonesome, {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing, and the 3rd Brigade, commanded by Col. Charles Whittlesey to [[Adamsville, Tennessee|Adamsville]], {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing. Col. [[Morgan Lewis Smith|Morgan L. Smith]]'s 1st Brigade remained with Wallace at Crump's Landing, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].<ref>Stephens, p. 76.</ref>\n\nBetween 5 and 6 a.m. on April 6, 1862, Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing was surprised and nearly routed by a sudden attack from the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Gen. [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat from his headquarters at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], to Crump's Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 8:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 83; Ferraro, p. 129.</ref> Grant's new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30&nbsp;a.m., were given verbally to an aide, who transcribed them before they were delivered.<ref>Stephens, pp. 83\u201384; Boomhower, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> The written orders were lost during the battle, so their exact wording cannot be confirmed; however, eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join the right side of the Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s 5th Division, who were encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.<ref>Stephens, pp. 71, 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nKnowledge of the area's roads played a critical role in Wallace's journey to the battlefield on April 6. In late March, after heavy rains made transportation difficult between Crump's Landing and Pittsburg Landing, Wallace's men had opened a route to Pittsburg Landing along Shunpike road, which connected to a road near Sherman's camp. Brig. Gen. [[W. H. L. Wallace]]'s men at Pittsburg Landing opened the River Road (also known as the Hamburg-Savannah Road), a route farther east.<ref>Stephens, pp. 72, 74.</ref>\n\nOf the two main routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the [[shunpiking|Shunpike]] road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's division near Shiloh Church.<ref>Stephens, p. 86; Boomhower, p. 60.</ref> The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter to a fellow officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so.<ref>Stephens, p. 75.</ref> Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination, and it did not specify which route the 3rd Division was ordered to take. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, p. 85; Boomhower, pp. 59\u201360.</ref><ref>Grant, v. I, pp. 336\u201337.</ref> Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nAfter a second messenger from Grant arrived around noon with word to move out, Wallace's division of approximately 5,800 men began their march toward the battlefield.<ref>Stephens, pp. 82, 87.</ref> Between 2 and 2:30&nbsp;p.m., a third messenger from Grant found Wallace along the Shunpike road, where he informed Wallace that Sherman had been forced back from Shiloh Church and was fighting closer to the river, near Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, pp. 87\u201388; Boomhower, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> The Union army had been pushed back so far that Wallace was to the rear of the advancing Southern troops.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nWallace considered attacking the Confederates, but abandoned the idea. Instead he made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops along the Shunpike road, follow a crossroads to the River Road, and then move south to Pittsburg Landing. Rather than realigning his troops, so that the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace countermarched his column to maintain their original order, keeping his artillery in the lead position to support the Union infantry on the field<ref>Boomhower, p. 61.</ref> After the time-consuming maneuver was completed, Wallace's troops returned to the midpoint on the Shunpike road, crossed east over a path to the River Road, and followed it south to join Grant's army on the field. Progress was slow due to the road conditions and countermarch. Wallace's division arrived at Pittsburg Landing about 6:30&nbsp;p.m., after having marched about {{convert|14|mi|km}} in nearly seven hours over roads that had been left in terrible conditions by recent rainstorms and previous Union marches. They gathered at the battlefield at dusk, about 7 p.m., with the fighting nearly over for the day, and took up a position on the right of the Union line.<ref>Stephens, pp. 80, 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shiloh Battle Apr7.png|thumb|200px|Map of the Battle of Shiloh, April 7, 1862]]\nThe next day, April 7, Wallace's division held the extreme right of the Union line.

Gen. Lew Wallace]]\nAt first, the battle was viewed by the [[Northern United States|North]] as a victory; however, on April 23, after civilians began hearing news of the high number of casualties, the Lincoln administration asked the Union army for further explanation.<ref>Stephens, pp. 105\u20136, and Boomhower, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Grant, who was accused of poor leadership at Shiloh, and his superior, Halleck, placed the blame on Wallace by asserting that his failure to follow orders and the delay in moving up the reserves on April 6 had nearly cost them the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8>Stephens, pp. 107\u201308.</ref>\n\nGrant had placed much of the blame on General Wallace, to whom he had sent verbal orders to bring his troops forward, accusing Wallace of failure in following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay in moving up reserves, nearly costing the Union the loss of the battle. After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders\", and first sent Colonel [[William R. Rowley]],<ref>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243</ref> ordering him to \"tell him to come up at once\" and that \"if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once\". When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, \"Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.\" Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.<ref>[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305</ref><ref>[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1862, Halleck reorganized his army and removed Wallace and John McClernand from active duty, placing both of them in reserve.<ref>Stephens, p. 112; Morrow, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWallace's reputation and career as a military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh.<ref name=Morrow9/> He spent the remainder of his life trying to resolve the accusations and change public opinion about his role in the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8/> On March 14, 1863, Wallace wrote a letter to Halleck that provided an official explanation of his actions. He also wrote Grant several letters and met with him in person more than once in an attempt to vindicate himself. On August 16, 1863, Wallace wrote Sherman for advice on the issue. Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace's concerns to Grant's attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.<ref>Ferraro, p. 131\u201334, 138, and 145.</ref>\n\nFor many years Grant stood by his original version of the orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road on the first day of battle.<ref>Ferraro, p. 146.</ref> After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind.<ref name=Stephens232>Stephens, p. 232.</ref><ref name=Ferraro147>Ferraro, p. 147.</ref> Grant wrote a letter to the editors at ''Century'', which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter \"modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh.\"<ref name=Ferraro147 /> While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.<ref name=\"Stephens232\" /><ref name=Grant>Grant, v. I, pp. 351\u201352.</ref>\n\nGrant's article in the February 1885 issue of ''Century'' became the basis of his chapter on Shiloh in his memoirs, which were published in 1886, and influenced many later accounts of Wallace's actions on the first day of battle.<ref name=Ferraro147 /> Grant acknowledged in his memoirs: \"If the position of our front had not changed, the road which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right than the River road.\"<ref name=Grant /> Wallace's account of the events appeared in his autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1906.<ref>Ferraro, p. 148.</ref> Despite his later fame and fortune as the writer of ''Ben-Hur'', Wallace continued to lament, \"Shiloh and its slanders! Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly.\"{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\n===Other military assignments===\nOn August 17, 1862, Wallace accepted a regiment command in the [[Department of the Ohio]] to help with the successful [[defense of Cincinnati]] during [[Braxton Bragg]]'s incursion into [[Kentucky]]. Next, Wallace took command of [[Camp Chase]], a prisoner-of-war camp at [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he remained until October 30, 1862. A month later Wallace was placed in charge of a five-member commission to investigate Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s conduct in response to the Confederate invasion of [[Kentucky]]. The commission criticized Buell for his retreat, but it did not find him disloyal to the Union. When the commission's work was completed on May 6, 1863, Wallace returned to Indiana to wait for a new command.<ref>Stephens, pp. 127, 137\u201346.</ref> In mid-July 1863, while Wallace was home, he helped protect the railroad junction at [[North Vernon, Indiana]], from Confederate general [[Morgan's Raid|John Hunt Morgan's raid]] into southern Indiana.<ref>Stephens, pp. 153\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Monocacy===\n{{Main|Battle of Monocacy}}\nWallace's most notable service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864 at the [[Battle of Monocacy]] part of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Although Confederate General [[Jubal A. Early]] and an estimated 15,000 troops defeated Wallace's troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Boomhower, p. 8.</ref> Wallace's men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived in Washington at around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war,<ref>Kennedy, p. 308.</ref> but Union reinforcements had already arrived at [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.<ref>Kennedy, p. 305; Stephens, p. 204.</ref>\n\nWallace, who had returned to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]], which was headquartered in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 161\u201362, 164, 175; Boomhower, pp. 8, 69.</ref> On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under [[James B. Ricketts]] from [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 192.</ref> Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C., was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived.<ref>Stephens, pp. 185\u201386.</ref> Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks for more than six hours before retreating to Baltimore.<ref>Boomhower, p. 73; Stephens, pp. 196, 200.</ref><ref>Kennedy, p. 305.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle Wallace informed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate troops, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them. When Grant learned of the defeat, he named Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|E. O. C. Ord]] as Wallace's replacement in command of VIII Corps. On July 28, after officials learned how Wallace's efforts at Monocacy helped save Washington D.C. from capture, he was reinstated as commander of VIII Corps.<ref>Stephens, pp. 201, 203, 205; Boomhower, p. 74.</ref> In [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's memoirs]], he praised Wallace's delaying tactics at Monocacy:\n\n<blockquote>If Early had been but one day earlier, he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.&nbsp;... General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory.<ref>Grant, [http://www.bartleby.com/1011/57.html Chapter LVII, p. 13.]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Later military service===\nOn January 22, 1865, Grant ordered Wallace to the [[Rio Grande]] in southern [[Texas]] to investigate Confederate military operations in the area. Although Wallace was not officially authorized to offer terms, he did discuss proposals for the surrender of the Confederate troops in the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. Wallace provided Grant with copies of his proposals and reported on the negotiations, but no agreement was made. Before returning to Baltimore, Wallace also met with Mexican military leaders to discuss the U.S. government's unofficial efforts to aid in expelling [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian's]] French occupation forces from Mexico.<ref>Stephens, pp. 212\u201317.</ref>\n\nFollowing President Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865, Wallace was appointed to the military commission that investigated the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination conspirators]]. The commission, which began in May, was dissolved on June 30, 1865, after all eight conspirators were found guilty.<ref>Stephens, pp. 219, 221\u201322; Morrow, p. 11.</ref> In mid-August 1865, Wallace was appointed head of an eight-member military commission that investigated the conduct of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant in charge of the South's [[Andersonville prison camp]]. The [[court-martial]] which took nearly two months, opened on August 21, 1865. At its conclusion Wirz was found guilty and sentenced to death.<ref name=Eicher551/><ref>Stephens, pp. 223, 226;  Boomhower, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1865, Wallace had accepted an offer to become a major general in the Mexican army, but the agreement, which was contingent upon his resignation from the U.S. Army, was delayed by Wallace's service on the two military commissions. Wallace tendered his resignation from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1865, effective November 30,<ref name=Eicher773 /><ref>Stephens, p. 227.</ref> and returned to Mexico to assist the Mexican army. Although the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez|Ju\u00e1rez]] government promised Wallace $100,000 for his services, he returned to the United States in 1867 in deep financial debt.<ref>Morrow, p. 12.</ref><ref>Wallace received $15,000 from the Mexican government in 1882. See Stephens, pp. 215\u201317, 229.</ref>\n\n==Political and diplomatic career==\nWallace returned to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, and he turned to politics.<ref>Morrow, p. 11.</ref> Wallace made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the 1876 election.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]], where he served from August 1878 to March 1881.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 98, 101; Ferraro, p. 142; Morrow, p. 15.</ref> His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican [[President of the United States|president]] [[James A. Garfield]] appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]], as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Minister]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.<ref>Stephens, pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\n===Territorial governor of New Mexico===\nWallace arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on September 29, 1878, to begin his service as governor of the New Mexico Territory during a time of lawless violence and political corruption.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 97, 101.</ref> Wallace was involved in efforts to resolve New Mexico's [[Lincoln County War]], a contentious and violent disagreement among the county's residents, and tried to end a series of Apache raids on territorial settlers.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 107; Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> In 1880, while living at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe, Wallace also completed the manuscript for ''Ben Hur''.<ref>Boomhower, p. 108; Morrow, pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1879, after previous efforts to restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings.<ref name=Boom102>Boomhower, p. 102.</ref> One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as [[Billy the Kid]].<ref>Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with Bonney, who had witnessed the murder of a Lincoln County lawyer named Huston Chapman. Wallace wanted him to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but Bonney wanted Wallace's protection from his enemies and amnesty for his earlier crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for Bonney to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be \"scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds.\"<ref>Utley, p. 118.</ref> On March 20 Bonney agreed to provide grand jury testimony against those involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for a \"fake\" arrest and Bonney's detention in a local jail to assure his safety.<ref>Boomhower, p. 103.</ref> Bonney testified in court on April 14, as agreed. However, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free.<ref name=Humanities/> After spending several weeks in jail, Bonney escaped and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. He was shot and killed on July 14, 1881, by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 106\u201307, 111.</ref>\n\nOn December 31, 2010, on his last day in office, then-Governor [[Bill Richardson]] of New Mexico declined a pardon request from Bonney's supporters, citing a \"lack of conclusiveness and the historical ambiguity\" over Wallace's promise of amnesty. Descendants of Wallace and Garrett were among those who opposed the pardon.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Lacey|title=No Pardon for Billy the Kid|work=New York Times|date=December 31, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/us/01billy.html|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. diplomat in the Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:Wallace Az indus herceg.png|thumb|200px|''The Prince of India'' (Hungarian edition, 1930s)]]\n\nOn May 19, 1881, Wallace was appointed U.S. Minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]], Turkey). Wallace remained at the diplomatic post until 1885, and became a trusted friend of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. When a crisis developed between the Turkish and British governments over control of Egypt, Wallace served as an intermediary between the sultan and [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the British ambassador. Although Wallace's efforts were unsuccessful, he earned respect for his efforts and a promotion in the U.S. diplomatic service.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 112, 118, 122.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, an editorial aimed at Wallace appeared in the newspaper ''[[Havatzelet]]'' (xiii. No. 6) titled \"An American and yet a Despot\". The editorial caused the ''Havatzelet'' to be suspended and its editor [[Israel Dov Frumkin]] to be imprisoned for forty-five days by order from Constantinople, directed to the pasha of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]]. The incident that led to the editorial was the dismissal, made at Wallace's request, of Joseph Kriger, the Jewish secretary and interpreter to the pasha of Jerusalem. Wallace complained that Kriger had failed to receive him with the honor due to his rank, and refused to issue any apology for the alleged shortcoming. ''Havatzelet'' claimed that the proceeding was instigated by missionaries, whom Wallace strongly supported.<ref>Sokolow, Sefer Zikkaron, pp. 175\u201380, Warsaw, 1890.</ref>\n\nIn addition to Wallace's diplomatic duties, which included protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. trade rights in the area, Wallace found time to travel and do historical research. Wallace visited [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area, the site for his novel, ''Ben-Hur'', and did research in Constantinople, the locale for ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'', which he began writing in 1887.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 119, 125.</ref>\n\nThe election of [[Grover Cleveland]], the Democratic candidate for president, ended Wallace's political appointment. He resigned from the U.S. diplomatic service on March 4, 1885.<ref name=Boom122>Boomhower, p. 122.</ref> The sultan wanted Wallace to continue to work in the Ottoman Empire, and even made a proposal to have him represent Ottoman interests in England or France, but Wallace declined and returned home to Crawfordsville.<ref name=Boom122/><ref>Stephens, pp. 230\u201331; Morrow, p. 21.</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nWallace confessed in his autobiography that he took up writing as a diversion from studying law. Although he wrote several books, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), which established his fame as an author.<ref>Morrow, p. 11; Forbes, p. 387.</ref>\n\nIn 1843, Wallace began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.<ref>Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> The popular historical novel, with Cortez's conquest of Mexico as its central theme, was based on [[William H. Prescott]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''.<ref>Forbes, p. 387; McKee, \"The Early Life of Lew Wallace\", p. 215.</ref> Wallace's book sold seven thousand copies in its first year.

Wallace considered ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'' (1893) as his best novel.<ref>Boomhower, p. 126.</ref> He also wrote a biography of President [[Benjamin Harrison]], a fellow Hoosier and Civil War general, and ''The Wooing of Malkatoon'' (1898), a narrative poem. Wallace was writing his autobiography when he died in 1905. His wife Susan completed it with the assistance of [[Mary Hannah Krout]], another author from Crawfordsville. It was published posthumously in 1906.<ref>Stephens, pp. 234, 236.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nWallace continued to write after his return from Turkey. He also patented several of his own inventions, built a seven-story apartment building in Indianapolis, [[The Blacherne]], and drew up plans for a private study at his home in Crawfordsville.<ref>Boomhower, p. 126; Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 415.</ref> Wallace remained active in veterans groups, including writing a speech for the dedication of the battlefield at the [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 232\u201333.</ref>\n\nWallace's elaborate writing study, which he described as \"a pleasure-house for my soul\",<ref>Morrow, p. 35.</ref> served as his private retreat.<ref name=Humanities/> Now called the [[General Lew Wallace Study|General Lew Wallace Study and Museum]], it was built between 1895 and 1898, adjacent to his residence in Crawfordsville, and set in an enclosed park.

In winter, he would fire up the coal furnace in the Study basement and fish from the windows. He loved fishing so much he invented and patented a special traveler's fishing pole. After just a few years he had the moat drained as it was negatively affecting the Study foundation and he worried about his grandchildren and neighborhood children falling into the water.\n\nOn April 5, 1898, at the outbreak of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Wallace, at age seventy-one, offered to raise and lead a force of soldiers, but the war office refused. Undeterred, he went to a local recruiting office and attempted to enlist as a private, but was rejected again, presumably because of his age.<ref>Stephens, p. 236; Boomhower, p. 129; Morrow, p. 22.</ref>\n\nWallace's service at the battle of Shiloh continued to haunt him in later life. The debate persisted in book publications, magazine articles, pamphlets, speeches, and in private correspondence.<ref>Stephens, p. 231; Ferraro, pp. 143\u201344.</ref> Wallace attended a reunion at Shiloh in 1894, his first return since 1862, and retraced his journey to the battlefield with veterans from the 3rd Division. He returned to Shiloh for a final time in 1901 to walk the battlefield with David W. Reed, the Shiloh Battlefield Commission's historian, and others. Wallace died before the manuscript of his memoirs was fully completed, and it is unknown whether he would have revised his final account of the battle.<ref>Stephens, pp. 233\u201334, 236.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWallace died at home in Crawfordsville, on February 15, 1905,{{r|swansburg20130326}} of [[atrophic gastritis]].<ref>The physician's cause of death on his death certificate is \"atrophy of stomach\", which is consistent with documented reports of his health beginning in Fall 1904.

Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and a flotilla of Union ironclads and [[timberclad warship|timberclad]] gunboats under the command of Flag Officer [[Andrew Hull Foote]] made their way toward the Confederate fort along the [[Tennessee River]] in western [[Tennessee]]. Wallace's brigade, which was attached to Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]]'s division, was ordered to occupy Fort Heiman, an uncompleted Confederate fort across the river from Fort Henry. Wallace's troops secured the deserted fort and watched the Union attack on Fort Henry from their hilltop position. On February 6, after more than an hour of bombardment from the Union gunboats, Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]], surrendered Fort Henry to Grant.<ref name=Stephens45-47>Stephens, pp. 45\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Donelson Feb15pm.png|thumb|left|200px|Map showing Wallace's counterattack at [[Fort Donelson]] (1862)]]\nGrant's superior, Maj.

Many of the men in the division were untested reinforcements.<ref>Stephens, p. 48.</ref> Wallace's three brigades took up position in the center of the Union line, facing Fort Donelson.<ref name=Boom50/>\n\nDuring the fierce Confederate assault on February 15, and in Grant's absence from the battlefield, Wallace acted on his own initiative to send Cruft's brigade to reinforce the beleaguered division of Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], despite orders from Grant to hold his position and prevent the enemy from escaping and without Grant's authority to take the offensive.<ref>Boomhower, p. 51.</ref><ref>Grant later approved of Wallace's actions. See Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> With the Confederates continuing to advance, Wallace led a second brigade to the right and engaged the Confederates with infantry and artillery. Wallace's decision stopped their forward movement and was key in stabilizing a defensive line for the Union troops. After the Confederate assault had been checked, Wallace led a counterattack that regained the lost ground on the Union right.<ref>Stephens, p. 62; Ferraro, p. 127.</ref> On March 21, 1862, Wallace, McClernand, and C.

Gen. Grant.\n\nWhat was to become a long-standing controversy developed around the contents of Wallace's written orders on April 6, the 3rd Division's movements on the first day of battle, and their late arrival on the field.<ref>Ferraro, p. 129; Stephens, p. 84.</ref> On the second day of battle, Wallace's division joined reinforcements from Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army to play an important role in the Union victory.<ref>Boomhower, p. 7.</ref> Prior to the battle, Wallace's division had been left in reserve and was encamped near Crump's Landing. Their orders were to guard the Union's right flank and cover the road to Bethel Station, Tennessee, where railroad lines led to [[Corinth, Mississippi]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the south.<ref>Stephens, pp. 65, 72; Ferraro, p. 128.</ref> To protect the road from Crump's Landing and Bethel Station, Wallace sent Col. [[John Milton Thayer|John M. Thayer]]'s 2nd Brigade to Stoney Lonesome, {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing, and the 3rd Brigade, commanded by Col. Charles Whittlesey to [[Adamsville, Tennessee|Adamsville]], {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} west of Crump's Landing. Col. [[Morgan Lewis Smith|Morgan L. Smith]]'s 1st Brigade remained with Wallace at Crump's Landing, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee]].<ref>Stephens, p. 76.</ref>\n\nBetween 5 and 6 a.m. on April 6, 1862, Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing was surprised and nearly routed by a sudden attack from the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] under Gen. [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat from his headquarters at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], to Crump's Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait in reserve and be ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 8:30&nbsp;a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 83; Ferraro, p. 129.</ref> Grant's new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30&nbsp;a.m., were given verbally to an aide, who transcribed them before they were delivered.<ref>Stephens, pp. 83\u201384; Boomhower, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> The written orders were lost during the battle, so their exact wording cannot be confirmed; however, eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join the right side of the Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s 5th Division, who were encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.<ref>Stephens, pp. 71, 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nKnowledge of the area's roads played a critical role in Wallace's journey to the battlefield on April 6. In late March, after heavy rains made transportation difficult between Crump's Landing and Pittsburg Landing, Wallace's men had opened a route to Pittsburg Landing along Shunpike road, which connected to a road near Sherman's camp. Brig. Gen. [[W. H. L. Wallace]]'s men at Pittsburg Landing opened the River Road (also known as the Hamburg-Savannah Road), a route farther east.<ref>Stephens, pp. 72, 74.</ref>\n\nOf the two main routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the [[shunpiking|Shunpike]] road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's division near Shiloh Church.<ref>Stephens, p. 86; Boomhower, p. 60.</ref> The day before the battle, Wallace wrote a letter to a fellow officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so.<ref>Stephens, p. 75.</ref> Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination, and it did not specify which route the 3rd Division was ordered to take. However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, p. 85; Boomhower, pp. 59\u201360.</ref><ref>Grant, v. I, pp. 336\u201337.</ref> Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nAfter a second messenger from Grant arrived around noon with word to move out, Wallace's division of approximately 5,800 men began their march toward the battlefield.<ref>Stephens, pp. 82, 87.</ref> Between 2 and 2:30&nbsp;p.m., a third messenger from Grant found Wallace along the Shunpike road, where he informed Wallace that Sherman had been forced back from Shiloh Church and was fighting closer to the river, near Pittsburg Landing.<ref>Stephens, pp. 87\u201388; Boomhower, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> The Union army had been pushed back so far that Wallace was to the rear of the advancing Southern troops.{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\nWallace considered attacking the Confederates, but abandoned the idea. Instead he made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops along the Shunpike road, follow a crossroads to the River Road, and then move south to Pittsburg Landing. Rather than realigning his troops, so that the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace countermarched his column to maintain their original order, keeping his artillery in the lead position to support the Union infantry on the field<ref>Boomhower, p. 61.</ref> After the time-consuming maneuver was completed, Wallace's troops returned to the midpoint on the Shunpike road, crossed east over a path to the River Road, and followed it south to join Grant's army on the field. Progress was slow due to the road conditions and countermarch. Wallace's division arrived at Pittsburg Landing about 6:30&nbsp;p.m., after having marched about {{convert|14|mi|km}} in nearly seven hours over roads that had been left in terrible conditions by recent rainstorms and previous Union marches. They gathered at the battlefield at dusk, about 7 p.m., with the fighting nearly over for the day, and took up a position on the right of the Union line.<ref>Stephens, pp. 80, 90\u201391.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shiloh Battle Apr7.png|thumb|200px|Map of the Battle of Shiloh, April 7, 1862]]\nThe next day, April 7, Wallace's division held the extreme right of the Union line.

Gen. Lew Wallace]]\nAt first, the battle was viewed by the [[Northern United States|North]] as a victory; however, on April 23, after civilians began hearing news of the high number of casualties, the Lincoln administration asked the Union army for further explanation.<ref>Stephens, pp. 105\u20136, and Boomhower, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Grant, who was accused of poor leadership at Shiloh, and his superior, Halleck, placed the blame on Wallace by asserting that his failure to follow orders and the delay in moving up the reserves on April 6 had nearly cost them the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8>Stephens, pp. 107\u201308.</ref>\n\nGrant had placed much of the blame on General Wallace, to whom he had sent verbal orders to bring his troops forward, accusing Wallace of failure in following those orders, which he believed resulted in the delay in moving up reserves, nearly costing the Union the loss of the battle. After hearing reports that Wallace refused to obey anything but ''written'' orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders\", and first sent Colonel [[William R. Rowley]],<ref>[[#richardson|Richardson, 1885]] p. 243</ref> ordering him to \"tell him to come up at once\" and that \"if he should require a written order of you, you will give it to him at once\". When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lay just ahead, exclaiming, \"Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it.\" Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.<ref>[[#groom|Groom, 2012]], p. 305</ref><ref>[[#timothy|Smith, Timothy, 2013]] pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1862, Halleck reorganized his army and removed Wallace and John McClernand from active duty, placing both of them in reserve.<ref>Stephens, p. 112; Morrow, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWallace's reputation and career as a military leader suffered a significant setback from controversy over Shiloh.<ref name=Morrow9/> He spent the remainder of his life trying to resolve the accusations and change public opinion about his role in the battle.<ref name=Stephens107-8/> On March 14, 1863, Wallace wrote a letter to Halleck that provided an official explanation of his actions. He also wrote Grant several letters and met with him in person more than once in an attempt to vindicate himself. On August 16, 1863, Wallace wrote Sherman for advice on the issue. Sherman urged Wallace to be patient and not to request a formal inquiry. Although Sherman brought Wallace's concerns to Grant's attention, Wallace was not given another active duty command until March 1864.<ref>Ferraro, p. 131\u201334, 138, and 145.</ref>\n\nFor many years Grant stood by his original version of the orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road on the first day of battle.<ref>Ferraro, p. 146.</ref> After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind.<ref name=Stephens232>Stephens, p. 232.</ref><ref name=Ferraro147>Ferraro, p. 147.</ref> Grant wrote a letter to the editors at ''Century'', which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter \"modifies very materially what I have said, and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh.\"<ref name=Ferraro147 /> While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.<ref name=\"Stephens232\" /><ref name=Grant>Grant, v.

Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not feel them as keenly.\"{{r|swansburg20130326}}\n\n===Other military assignments===\nOn August 17, 1862, Wallace accepted a regiment command in the [[Department of the Ohio]] to help with the successful [[defense of Cincinnati]] during [[Braxton Bragg]]'s incursion into [[Kentucky]]. Next, Wallace took command of [[Camp Chase]], a prisoner-of-war camp at [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he remained until October 30, 1862. A month later Wallace was placed in charge of a five-member commission to investigate Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s conduct in response to the Confederate invasion of [[Kentucky]]. The commission criticized Buell for his retreat, but it did not find him disloyal to the Union. When the commission's work was completed on May 6, 1863, Wallace returned to Indiana to wait for a new command.<ref>Stephens, pp. 127, 137\u201346.</ref> In mid-July 1863, while Wallace was home, he helped protect the railroad junction at [[North Vernon, Indiana]], from Confederate general [[Morgan's Raid|John Hunt Morgan's raid]] into southern Indiana.<ref>Stephens, pp. 153\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Monocacy===\n{{Main|Battle of Monocacy}}\nWallace's most notable service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864 at the [[Battle of Monocacy]] part of the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Although Confederate General [[Jubal A. Early]] and an estimated 15,000 troops defeated Wallace's troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>Boomhower, p. 8.</ref> Wallace's men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived in Washington at around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war,<ref>Kennedy, p. 308.</ref> but Union reinforcements had already arrived at [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]] to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.<ref>Kennedy, p. 305; Stephens, p. 204.</ref>\n\nWallace, who had returned to active duty on March 12, 1864, assumed command of [[VIII Corps (Union Army)|VIII Corps]], which was headquartered in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].<ref>Stephens, pp. 161\u201362, 164, 175; Boomhower, pp. 8, 69.</ref> On July 9, a combined Union force of approximately 5,800 men under Wallace's command (mostly hundred-days' men from VIII Corps) and a division under [[James B. Ricketts]] from [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] encountered Confederate troops at Monocacy Junction between 9 and 10 a.m.<ref>Stephens, p. 192.</ref> Although Wallace was uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington, D.C., was the Confederate objective, he knew his troops would have to delay the advance until Union reinforcements arrived.<ref>Stephens, pp. 185\u201386.</ref> Wallace's men repelled the Confederate attacks for more than six hours before retreating to Baltimore.<ref>Boomhower, p. 73; Stephens, pp. 196, 200.</ref><ref>Kennedy, p. 305.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle Wallace informed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate troops, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them. When Grant learned of the defeat, he named Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord|E. O. C. Ord]] as Wallace's replacement in command of VIII Corps. On July 28, after officials learned how Wallace's efforts at Monocacy helped save Washington D.C. from capture, he was reinstated as commander of VIII Corps.<ref>Stephens, pp. 201, 203, 205; Boomhower, p. 74.</ref> In [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's memoirs]], he praised Wallace's delaying tactics at Monocacy:\n\n<blockquote>If Early had been but one day earlier, he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.&nbsp;... General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him, a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory.<ref>Grant, [http://www.bartleby.com/1011/57.html Chapter LVII, p. 13.]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Later military service===\nOn January 22, 1865, Grant ordered Wallace to the [[Rio Grande]] in southern [[Texas]] to investigate Confederate military operations in the area. Although Wallace was not officially authorized to offer terms, he did discuss proposals for the surrender of the Confederate troops in the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. Wallace provided Grant with copies of his proposals and reported on the negotiations, but no agreement was made. Before returning to Baltimore, Wallace also met with Mexican military leaders to discuss the U.S. government's unofficial efforts to aid in expelling [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian's]] French occupation forces from Mexico.<ref>Stephens, pp. 212\u201317.</ref>\n\nFollowing President Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865, Wallace was appointed to the military commission that investigated the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination conspirators]]. The commission, which began in May, was dissolved on June 30, 1865, after all eight conspirators were found guilty.<ref>Stephens, pp. 219, 221\u201322; Morrow, p. 11.</ref> In mid-August 1865, Wallace was appointed head of an eight-member military commission that investigated the conduct of [[Henry Wirz]], the Confederate commandant in charge of the South's [[Andersonville prison camp]]. The [[court-martial]] which took nearly two months, opened on August 21, 1865. At its conclusion Wirz was found guilty and sentenced to death.<ref name=Eicher551/><ref>Stephens, pp. 223, 226;  Boomhower, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 1865, Wallace had accepted an offer to become a major general in the Mexican army, but the agreement, which was contingent upon his resignation from the U.S. Army, was delayed by Wallace's service on the two military commissions. Wallace tendered his resignation from the U.S. Army on November 4, 1865, effective November 30,<ref name=Eicher773 /><ref>Stephens, p. 227.</ref> and returned to Mexico to assist the Mexican army. Although the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez|Ju\u00e1rez]] government promised Wallace $100,000 for his services, he returned to the United States in 1867 in deep financial debt.<ref>Morrow, p. 12.</ref><ref>Wallace received $15,000 from the Mexican government in 1882. See Stephens, pp. 215\u201317, 229.</ref>\n\n==Political and diplomatic career==\nWallace returned to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, and he turned to politics.<ref>Morrow, p. 11.</ref> Wallace made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the 1876 election.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]], where he served from August 1878 to March 1881.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 98, 101; Ferraro, p. 142; Morrow, p. 15.</ref> His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican [[President of the United States|president]] [[James A. Garfield]] appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]], as [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|U.S. Minister]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.<ref>Stephens, pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\n===Territorial governor of New Mexico===\nWallace arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on September 29, 1878, to begin his service as governor of the New Mexico Territory during a time of lawless violence and political corruption.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 97, 101.</ref> Wallace was involved in efforts to resolve New Mexico's [[Lincoln County War]], a contentious and violent disagreement among the county's residents, and tried to end a series of Apache raids on territorial settlers.<ref>Stephens, p. 229; Boomhower, p. 107; Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> In 1880, while living at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe, Wallace also completed the manuscript for ''Ben Hur''.<ref>Boomhower, p. 108; Morrow, pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1879, after previous efforts to restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings.<ref name=Boom102>Boomhower, p. 102.</ref> One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as [[Billy the Kid]].<ref>Ferraro, p. 142.</ref> On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with Bonney, who had witnessed the murder of a Lincoln County lawyer named Huston Chapman. Wallace wanted him to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but Bonney wanted Wallace's protection from his enemies and amnesty for his earlier crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for Bonney to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be \"scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds.\"<ref>Utley, p. 118.</ref> On March 20 Bonney agreed to provide grand jury testimony against those involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for a \"fake\" arrest and Bonney's detention in a local jail to assure his safety.<ref>Boomhower, p. 103.</ref> Bonney testified in court on April 14, as agreed. However, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free.<ref name=Humanities/> After spending several weeks in jail, Bonney escaped and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. He was shot and killed on July 14, 1881, by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 106\u201307, 111.</ref>\n\nOn December 31, 2010, on his last day in office, then-Governor [[Bill Richardson]] of New Mexico declined a pardon request from Bonney's supporters, citing a \"lack of conclusiveness and the historical ambiguity\" over Wallace's promise of amnesty. Descendants of Wallace and Garrett were among those who opposed the pardon.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Lacey|title=No Pardon for Billy the Kid|work=New York Times|date=2010-12-31|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/01/us/01billy.html|accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. diplomat in the Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:Wallace Az indus herceg.png|thumb|200px|''The Prince of India'' (Hungarian edition, 1930s)]]\n\nOn May 19, 1881, Wallace was appointed U.S. Minister to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]], Turkey). Wallace remained at the diplomatic post until 1885, and became a trusted friend of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. When a crisis developed between the Turkish and British governments over control of Egypt, Wallace served as an intermediary between the sultan and [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], the British ambassador. Although Wallace's efforts were unsuccessful, he earned respect for his efforts and a promotion in the U.S. diplomatic service.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 112, 118, 122.</ref>\n\nIn 1883, an editorial aimed at Wallace appeared in the newspaper ''[[Havatzelet]]'' (xiii. No. 6) titled \"An American and yet a Despot\". The editorial caused the ''Havatzelet'' to be suspended and its editor [[Israel Dov Frumkin]] to be imprisoned for forty-five days by order from Constantinople, directed to the pasha of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]]. The incident that led to the editorial was the dismissal, made at Wallace's request, of Joseph Kriger, the Jewish secretary and interpreter to the pasha of Jerusalem. Wallace complained that Kriger had failed to receive him with the honor due to his rank, and refused to issue any apology for the alleged shortcoming. ''Havatzelet'' claimed that the proceeding was instigated by missionaries, whom Wallace strongly supported.<ref>Sokolow, Sefer Zikkaron, pp. 175\u201380, Warsaw, 1890.</ref>\n\nIn addition to Wallace's diplomatic duties, which included protection of U.S. citizens and U.S. trade rights in the area, Wallace found time to travel and do historical research. Wallace visited [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area, the site for his novel, ''Ben-Hur'', and did research in Constantinople, the locale for ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell'', which he began writing in 1887.<ref>Boomhower, pp. 119, 125.</ref>\n\nThe election of [[Grover Cleveland]], the Democratic candidate for president, ended Wallace's political appointment. He resigned from the U.S. diplomatic service on March 4, 1885.<ref name=Boom122>Boomhower, p. 122.</ref> The sultan wanted Wallace to continue to work in the Ottoman Empire, and even made a proposal to have him represent Ottoman interests in England or France, but Wallace declined and returned home to Crawfordsville.<ref name=Boom122/><ref>Stephens, pp. 230\u201331; Morrow, p. 21.</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nWallace confessed in his autobiography that he took up writing as a diversion from studying law. Although he wrote several books, Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1880), which established his fame as an author.<ref>Morrow, p. 11; Forbes, p. 387.</ref>\n\nIn 1843, Wallace began writing his first novel, ''The Fair God'', but it was not published until 1873.<ref>Boomhower, p. 89.</ref> The popular historical novel, with Cortez's conquest of Mexico as its central theme, was based on [[William H. Prescott]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''.<ref>Forbes, p. 387; McKee, \"The Early Life of Lew Wallace\", p. 215.</ref> Wallace's book sold seven thousand copies in its first year.

[[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963\u20131995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:\n{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful.

Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.

[[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963\u20131995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:\n{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful. Parents should exercise their judgment in bringing their children to the exhibition.

Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.\n\nHowever, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].<ref name=\"Dalry\">Dalrymple, Theodore.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves. This was meant to provide convenient access to the prison for the Warden while normalizing life for the Warden's wife and children; recognizing his duel role as Warden, and as father/husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmurrayarchitect.ca/fort-saskatchewan-historic-buildings/|title=Fort Saskatchewan Historic Buildings|date=2016-03-02|website=David Murray Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion and development ===\nIn 1952, [[Sherritt Gordon Mines]] started construction on a $25-million nickel refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, which started production in 1954.<ref name=\"peterream4\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=459}}</ref> Following Sherritt Gordon's locating in Fort Saskatchewan, more industries constructed plants in the town.

Created in 1542, it elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), traditionally known as the [[knight of the shire]], by the [[first-past-the-post]] system of election.\n\nThe [[Montgomeryshire (Assembly constituency)|Montgomeryshire Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe seat is based on the ancient county of [[Montgomeryshire]], in the [[Subdivisions of Wales|principal area]] of [[Powys]]. One of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s most rural and isolated constituencies, Montgomeryshire elected Liberal or Liberal-affiliated candidates from 1880, until a Conservative victory in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. In the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] it was only seat in England and Wales where a sitting Conservative MP was unseated, while nationally his party's seat majority increased. However, in 2010, the Conservatives won and held the seat in 2015 and 2017, with an increased majority. The seat is believed to be marginal, but the figures show that this is not the case. The seat was officially known as Montgomery before 1997. It is the only seat in Wales never to have elected a Labour MP. \n\nUntil 1918 this seat, in common with many others, contained an [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|enclaved seat]] which was comprised the boroughs of Montgomery, Llanfyllin, Llanidloes, Newtown and Welshpool. This seat survived the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] which abolished many similar seats. The seat was finally abolished in 1918 and absorbed into the wider Montgomery seat where it remains today.\n\n===Proposed constituency changes===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat was to be partitioned, the northern half including Welshpool to be merged with [[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]] to form a new seat of South Clwyd and North Montgomeryshire; most of the southern including Newtown will be merged with the [[Brecon and Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor seat]] to form a seat renamed as Brecon, Radnor and Montgomery,<ref>{{cite news|title=It's All Change For MPs, Political map to be transformed|work=Shropshire Star|date=13 September 2016|page=1}}Report by Mark Andrews.</ref> and the wards of Llanidloes and Blaen Hafren merged into the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion constituency]] which would form part of a new seat called Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former MP urges re-think on move|work=Shropshire Star|date=17 September 2016|page=16}}Report based on criticism of proposals by former Montgomeryshire MP Delwyn Williams.</ref> However, the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2019|2019]] were fought on existing boundaries.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\n===1542\u20131604===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1542|| [[James Leche]]<ref name = HoP>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/montgomeryshire | title= History of Parliament| accessdate= 2011-08-30}}</ref>\n|-\n|1545|| [[Humphrey Lloyd (by 1498-1562 or later)|Humphrey Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1547|| [[Humphrey Lloyd (by 1498-1562 or later)|Humphrey Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1555||''Not known''\n|-\n|1558|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1559 (Jan)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/montgomeryshire | title= History of Parliament| accessdate= 2011-08-30}}</ref>\n|-\n|1562\u20131563|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1571|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Price (died 1602)|John Price]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1584 (Oct)|| [[Richard Herbert (c.1557-1596)|Richard Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1586 (Oct)|| [[Oliver Lloyd (MP)|Oliver Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1588 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1593|| [[Reginald Williams (MP)|Reginald WIlliams]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1597 (Sep)|| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1601 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|}\n\n===1604\u2013present===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|m|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|\n|1604\u20131611\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1614\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1621\u20131622\n| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1624\n| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1624\u20131629\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Short Parliament|1640]]\n|[[Richard Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Richard Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Long Parliament|1640]]\u20131642\n|[[Sir John Pryce, 1st Baronet|John Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|''1642''\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Seat vacant from 12 September 1642, when Pryce was disabled from sitting''\n|-\n|\n|1647\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1648\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Seat vacant after Vaughan was excluded in [[Pride's Purge]]''\n|-\n|\n|1653\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Not separately represented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1654\u20131655<br/>''(two members)''\n|[[Sir Charles Lloyd, 1st Baronet (of Garth)|Charles Lloyd]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Sir John Pryce, 1st Baronet|John Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1656\u20131658<br/>''(two members)''\n|[[Sir Charles Lloyd, 1st Baronet (of Garth)|Charles Lloyd]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Hugh Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1659\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]] \n||\n|-\n|\n|1660\n|[[John Purcell (MP)|John Purcell]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1661\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]]\n||\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Tories (British political party)/meta/color}}\" |\n|1661\n|[[Andrew Newport|Hon.

[[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] represented in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Created in 1542, it elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), traditionally known as the [[knight of the shire]], by the [[first-past-the-post]] system of election.\n\nThe [[Montgomeryshire (Assembly constituency)|Montgomeryshire Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe seat is based on the ancient county of [[Montgomeryshire]], in the [[Subdivisions of Wales|principal area]] of [[Powys]]. One of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s most rural and isolated constituencies, Montgomeryshire elected Liberal or Liberal-affiliated candidates from 1880, until a Conservative victory in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. In the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] it was only seat in England and Wales where a sitting Conservative MP was unseated, while nationally his party's seat majority increased. However, in 2010, the Conservatives won and held the seat in 2015 and 2017, with an increased majority. The seat is believed to be marginal, but the figures show that this is not the case. The seat was officially known as Montgomery before 1997. It is the only seat in Wales never to have elected a Labour MP. \n\nUntil 1918 this seat, in common with many others, contained an [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|enclaved seat]] which was comprised the boroughs of Montgomery, Llanfyllin, Llanidloes, Newtown and Welshpool. This seat survived the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] which abolished many similar seats. The seat was finally abolished in 1918 and absorbed into the wider Montgomery seat where it remains today.\n\n===Proposed constituency changes===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat was to be partitioned, the northern half including Welshpool to be merged with [[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]] to form a new seat of South Clwyd and North Montgomeryshire; most of the southern including Newtown will be merged with the [[Brecon and Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor seat]] to form a seat renamed as Brecon, Radnor and Montgomery,<ref>{{cite news|title=It's All Change For MPs, Political map to be transformed|work=Shropshire Star|date=13 September 2016|page=1}}Report by Mark Andrews.</ref> and the wards of Llanidloes and Blaen Hafren merged into the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion constituency]] which would form part of a new seat called Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former MP urges re-think on move|work=Shropshire Star|date=17 September 2016|page=16}}Report based on criticism of proposals by former Montgomeryshire MP Delwyn Williams.</ref> However, the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2019|2019]] were fought on existing boundaries.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\n===1542\u20131604===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1542|| [[James Leche]]<ref name = HoP>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/montgomeryshire | title= History of Parliament| accessdate= 2011-08-30}}</ref>\n|-\n|1545|| [[Humphrey Lloyd (by 1498-1562 or later)|Humphrey Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1547|| [[Humphrey Lloyd (by 1498-1562 or later)|Humphrey Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1555||''Not known''\n|-\n|1558|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1559 (Jan)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/montgomeryshire | title= History of Parliament| accessdate= 2011-08-30}}</ref>\n|-\n|1562\u20131563|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1571|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Price (died 1602)|John Price]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1584 (Oct)|| [[Richard Herbert (c.1557-1596)|Richard Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1586 (Oct)|| [[Oliver Lloyd (MP)|Oliver Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1588 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1593|| [[Reginald Williams (MP)|Reginald WIlliams]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1597 (Sep)|| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1601 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|}\n\n===1604\u2013present===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|m|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|\n|1604\u20131611\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1614\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1621\u20131622\n| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1624\n| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1624\u20131629\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Short Parliament|1640]]\n|[[Richard Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Richard Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Long Parliament|1640]]\u20131642\n|[[Sir John Pryce, 1st Baronet|John Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|''1642''\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Seat vacant from 12 September 1642, when Pryce was disabled from sitting''\n|-\n|\n|1647\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1648\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Seat vacant after Vaughan was excluded in [[Pride's Purge]]''\n|-\n|\n|1653\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Not separately represented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1654\u20131655<br/>''(two members)''\n|[[Sir Charles Lloyd, 1st Baronet (of Garth)|Charles Lloyd]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Sir John Pryce, 1st Baronet|John Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1656\u20131658<br/>''(two members)''\n|[[Sir Charles Lloyd, 1st Baronet (of Garth)|Charles Lloyd]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Hugh Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1659\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]] \n||\n|-\n|\n|1660\n|[[John Purcell (MP)|John Purcell]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1661\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]]\n||\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Tories (British political party)/meta/color}}\" |\n|1661\n|[[Andrew Newport|Hon.

As a student there he formed his first quartet, featuring vibraphonist [[Peter Shade]]. Recordings of this are on HEP (''Chronos'' and ''Silhouette'', released on Gearbox vinyl). Aside from some lessons at the Ivor Mairants School of Dance Music, Garrick was \"an entirely self-taught musician\" (he had been expelled from Eleanor B. Franklin-Pike's piano lessons for quoting from \"[[In the Mood]]\" at a pupils' concert), though he attended [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]], [[Boston]], as a mature student in the 1970s.\n\nSoon after graduating, Garrick became the musical director of \"Poetry & Jazz in Concert\", a roadshow devised by poet and publisher [[Jeremy Robson]], and involving writers as diverse as [[Laurie Lee]], [[Adrian Mitchell]], [[Vernon Scannell]], [[Spike Milligan]], [[Dannie Abse]], and John Smith. Garrick's quintet at this time included [[Joe Harriott]] and [[Shake Keane]]. Garrick came to special prominence in the British contemporary jazz world initially as the pianist with the [[Don Rendell]]\u2013[[Ian Carr]] quintet from 1965 to 1969, and led his own sextet from 1966.\n\nGarrick is perhaps best known for his jazz-choral works, the first of which he started in 1967. ''Jazz Praises'', an extended religious work for his sextet and a large choir, was performed at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London, and elsewhere. With poet John Smith he produced a series of such works, starting in 1969 with ''Mr Smith's Apocalypse'' for sextet, speakers, and chorus, which had its premiere at the [[Farnham Festival]]. The culmination of this partnership was ''A Zodiac of Angels'', a choral jazz ballet performed opposite [[Carmina Burana]] under the innovative baton of Victor Fox in the Opera Theatre Manchester in January 1988 and using symphony orchestra, seven jazz soloists including [[Norma Winstone]], full choir and a dance company. Indian classical music has influenced many of his compositions.\n\nAside from his performing, recording, and composing, Garrick was heavily involved in jazz education, and held teaching posts at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and at [[Trinity College of Music]], London; he continued to teach at summer schools, both for the [[Guildhall School of Music]] and on his own Jazz Academy Vacation Courses, from 1989 at Beechwood in [[Tunbridge Wells]]. For many years he took his trio into schools presenting interactive events to introduce children to jazz.\n\nHis own record label, Jazz Academy Records, features many albums by his Michael Garrick Jazz Orchestra and has trio, solo, quartet and other small groupings, some including singers [[Norma Winstone]], Anita Wardell and [[Jacqui Dankworth]]. In 2010 Garrick began a collaboration with vocalist Nette Robinson. At the time of his death he had also begun to develop work with a quartet including vibraphonist Jim Hart, which would have reworked some of the music of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] and would have provided an echo of his own first quartet, half a century earlier. That year, he also participated in the release of a 1964 recording, ''The Girl with Brown Hair'', featuring his trio (with [[Colin Barnes (musician)|Colin Barnes]] on drums and [[Dave Green (musician)|Dave Green]] on bass) backing [[Dick Morrissey]].<ref>[http://www.jazzjournal.co.uk/magazine/269 \"Review\",] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011081023/http://www.jazzjournal.co.uk/magazine/269 |date=11 October 2014 }} ''[[Jazz Journal]]''.

As a student there he formed his first quartet, featuring vibraphonist [[Peter Shade]]. Recordings of this are on HEP (''Chronos'' and ''Silhouette'', released on Gearbox vinyl). Aside from some lessons at the Ivor Mairants School of Dance Music, Garrick was \"an entirely self-taught musician\" (he had been expelled from Eleanor B. Franklin-Pike's piano lessons for quoting from \"[[In the Mood]]\" at a pupils' concert), though he attended [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]], [[Boston]], as a mature student in the 1970s.\n\nSoon after graduating, Garrick became the musical director of \"Poetry & Jazz in Concert\", a roadshow devised by poet and publisher [[Jeremy Robson]], and involving writers as diverse as [[Laurie Lee]], [[Adrian Mitchell]], [[Vernon Scannell]], [[Spike Milligan]], [[Dannie Abse]], and John Smith. Garrick's quintet at this time included [[Joe Harriott]] and [[Shake Keane]]. Garrick came to special prominence in the British contemporary jazz world initially as the pianist with the [[Don Rendell]]\u2013[[Ian Carr]] quintet from 1965 to 1969, and led his own sextet from 1966.\n\nGarrick is perhaps best known for his jazz-choral works, the first of which he started in 1967. ''Jazz Praises'', an extended religious work for his sextet and a large choir, was performed at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London, and elsewhere. With poet John Smith he produced a series of such works, starting in 1969 with ''Mr Smith's Apocalypse'' for sextet, speakers, and chorus, which had its premiere at the [[Farnham Festival]]. The culmination of this partnership was ''A Zodiac of Angels'', a choral jazz ballet performed opposite [[Carmina Burana]] under the innovative baton of Victor Fox in the Opera Theatre Manchester in January 1988 and using symphony orchestra, seven jazz soloists including [[Norma Winstone]], full choir and a dance company.
