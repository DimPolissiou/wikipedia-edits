He made wide-ranging reforms and mounted a comprehensive nation-building program in government, but his controversial handling of industrial relations led to a dramatic [[1929 Australian federal election|defeat at the polls in 1929]]. Bruce later pursued a long and influential diplomatic career as [[List of High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom|High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] (1933\u20131945) and chairman of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (1946\u20131951).\n\nBorn into a briefly wealthy [[Melbourne]] family, Bruce studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] and spent his early life tending to the importing and exporting business of his late father. He served on the front lines of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in World War I and returned to Australia wounded in 1917, becoming a spokesperson for government recruitment efforts. He gained the attention of the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]], who encouraged a political career. He was elected to [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]] in 1918, becoming [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] in 1921 and then prime minister in 1923, at the head of a coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]].\n\nIn office Bruce pursued an energetic and diverse agenda. He comprehensively overhauled federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to the new capital city of [[Canberra]]. He implemented various reforms to the [[Federalism in Australia|Australian federal system]] to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth, and helped develop the forerunners of the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the [[CSIRO]]. Bruce's \"men, money and markets\" scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand Australia's population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with Great Britain and the rest of the [[British Empire]]. However, his endeavours to overhaul Australia's industrial relations system brought his government into frequent conflict with the labour movement, and his radical proposal to abolish [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration|Commonwealth arbitration]] in 1929 prompted members of his own party to [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] to defeat the government. In the resounding loss at the [[1929 Australian federal election|subsequent election]] the prime minister lost his own seat, an event unprecedented in Australia and one that would not occur again until [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]].\n\nAlthough he returned to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the [[Lyons Government]] was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the [[League of Nations]], emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the [[developing world]]. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce was one of the key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the [[House of Lords]], as well as the first Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]]. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be returned to Canberra when he died.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Paterson, Laing and Bruce.jpg|thumb|left|The firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, 1900. John Bruce sits at the centre.]]\nStanley Melbourne Bruce was born on 15 April 1883 in [[St Kilda, Victoria]], a suburb of Melbourne, and was the youngest of five children.{{sfn|Carroll|p=105}} He disliked his given name and throughout his life preferred to be known by his initials \"S.M.\", even among close friends. His wife called him simply \"S\".{{sfn|Cumpston|p=1}}\n\nBruce's father, [[John Munro Bruce]], was born to Scottish parents in [[County Leitrim]], Ireland, and had emigrated to Australia in 1858 at the age of 18. His mother, Mary Ann Henderson, was Irish and had married her cousin John after emigrating to Australia in 1872 at the age of 24.{{sfn|Lee|pp=1\u20132}}  John Bruce became a talented businessman with \"a flair for buying and selling\",{{sfn|Lee|p=2}} which would secure him a partnership in an established Melbourne importing firm that in 1868 became known as Paterson, Laing and Bruce.{{sfn|Edwards|p=8}} As his wealth grew, John Bruce became influential in colonial Victoria's social and political life. An avid golfer, he was one of the founders of the [[Royal Melbourne Golf Club]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=9\u201310}} He was prominent in the [[Protectionist Party|liberal protectionist]] political movement within the state and an early supporter of future prime minister [[Alfred Deakin]]. John Bruce's success ensured that Stanley Bruce, his sister Mary and his brothers Ernest, William and Robert were born into affluence. Shortly after Stanley Bruce's birth the family relocated to the stately Wombalano manor, built by John Bruce, in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=8\u20139}} However, John Bruce was an aloof and remote figure in the lives of his children, as his son Stanley later recounted.{{sfn|Lee|p=3}} Despite their family's [[Presbyterian]] back-ground, Stanley Bruce was sent to Melbourne Church of England Grammar School (now [[Melbourne Grammar School]]) and subsequently Stanley Bruce would come to identify principally as [[Anglican]].{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}} Bruce was an average student but extremely active in the sporting life of the school and captain of its [[Australian rules football|football]] team, and then of the school itself in 1901. Today, the school honours him with his own house, Bruce House, the colours of which are scarlet and white. The house's mascot is a lion, symbolising Bruce's bravery.<ref>mgs.vic.edu.au</ref>{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe economic depression of the 1880s and 1890s hit the Bruce family fortunes hard. John Bruce lost much of his fortune in the Victorian bank collapse of 1894 and incurred large debts to buy out his partners in the importing business in 1897.{{sfn|Stirling|p=162}} The family suffered a great deal more tragedy over the coming decades. Stanley's brother William committed suicide in 1899, shortly after seeking treatment for mental illness.{{sfn|Lee|p=4}} Just two years later John Bruce took his own life during a business trip to Paris; he had suffered from depression as a result of the great pressures on his business and finances.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}  His sister Mary endured a long illness before succumbing in 1908, and his mother died too in 1912. Finally, Bruce's beloved brother Ernest shot himself in 1919, suffering from physical and mental injuries sustained during his military service in World War I.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of S.M. Bruce.png|left|upright|thumb|Bruce in the 1910s]]\nIn the aftermath of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, he moved to the United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in 1902.{{sfn|Lee|p=6}} He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including as a member of the Cambridge rowing crew that won the [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1904.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard D. Burnell|title=One Hundred and Fifty Years of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race: An Official History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_2BAAAAMAAJ&q|year=1979|publisher=Precision Press|location=Marlow, UK|page=104|isbn=978-0-9500638-7-4}}</ref> Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the [[Henley Royal Regatta]]) and write on the subject for much of his life.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=15\u201328}} Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered.{{sfn|Lee|pp=6\u20137}} During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a [[barrister]] in the London with the firm of [[Ashurst LLP|Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=16\u201317}} His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and [[Colombia]] in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}}\n\nBy 1912 Bruce was a businessman and a successful barrister, and it was in this year [[Ethel Bruce|Ethel Dunlop Anderson]] traveled to England and was reacquainted with Bruce, whom she had known as a child. Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatter]] family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce's interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}} Theirs was a close-knit relationship{{spaced ndash}} they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion.{{sfn|Lee|pp=8\u20139}} But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, and the fact that the Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce. His brother Ernest's daughter, Helen Bruce, came to play a large part in his life and was to become the main beneficiary of his Will but Bruce \"was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Military service==\n[[File:Sbruce.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Captain Bruce of the Royal Fusiliers during World War I]]\nBruce returned briefly to Australia in 1914, swapping positions within the company with his brother Ernest. World War I broke out in August of that year. Bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of the Empire, but all three of them would choose to serve in the British Army rather than the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. It was easier to obtain officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a close association with (and for many of them, long periods of residency in) Great Britain.{{sfn|Lee|p=9}} Bruce enlisted and received a commission as [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 7 February 1915<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=19 February 1915|issue=29079|page=1823|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29079/supplements/1823|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>  and was attached to the [[Royal Fusiliers|2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers]] in Egypt, which was then assigned to the [[British 29th Division]]. The 29th subsequently joined operations in Turkey along with [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] (MEF).{{sfn|Lee|p=10}} [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] had devised a strategy of capturing the [[Dardanelles]] from Turkey to allow naval access to Allied Russia. However [[Allies of World War I|allied naval forces]] were unable to secure passage through the narrow straits, and the MEF under Hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings. This was the beginning of the now infamous [[Gallipoli Campaign]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Moorehead|title=Gallipoli|year=2002|publisher=Harper Collins|location=Sydney|isbn=0-06-093708-4|pages=36\u201343}}</ref>\n\nBruce's regiment landed at [[Cape Helles]] in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished himself in the [[Trench warfare|construction of trenches]] and as an able commander.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=31\u201332}} His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose.{{sfn|Stirling|p=485}} He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at [[Suvla Bay]], where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the [[Military Cross]] and the [[Croix de Guerre]] for his service during these months,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=1 February 1916|issue=29460|page=1337|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29460/supplements/1337|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=22 February 1916|issue=29486|page=2068|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29486/supplements/2068|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> and rose to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 5 August.{{sfn|Lee|p=12}} He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}}\n\nAlthough it had been the agreement before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business.{{sfn|Edwards|p=33}} The [[War Office]] refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]],{{sfn|Carroll|p=106}} who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Third Supplement|issue=30123|page=5710|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/30123/supplement/5710|journal=London Gazette |date=9 June 1917}}</ref>\n\nHaving served with many of his countrymen he returned to Australia with a renewed sense of pride and mission in the country of his birth.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}} But having borne witness to the catastrophic loss of life in the Gallipoli Campaign and the death of most of his army comrades, as well as having suffered through the loss of most of his family, at age 34 Bruce was imbued with \"a driving ambition to make something of a life which providence had spared\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Early years in politics==\n\nBruce's popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him the attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]].{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} As Sir [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]] had recently resigned from parliament to become [[Chief Justice of Victoria]], there was to be [[1918 Flinders by-election|a by-election]] for his seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]] in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for.{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} The Nationalist [[preselection]] for the seat attracted many candidates, and [[Edward Fancourt Mitchell|Sir Edward Mitchell]], one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection with the help of the National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]] prevented the newly formed [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from [[Dandenong]] out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flinders By-Election: Declaration of Poll|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1660514|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=20 May 1918}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking to the delegates in Dandenong, Bruce summed up his political philosophy:\n<blockquote>A plain soldier and business man. I am no politician, nor have I any desire to be one. In the course of my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by the vast majority of the population.{{sfn|Lee|p=18}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and Billy Hughes, 1925.png|right|thumb|Billy Hughes, [[Herbert Pratten]] and Stanley Bruce]]\nBruce's early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on the affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. However, in 1921 he attracted the attention of his parliamentary colleagues over the matter of the [[Commonwealth Line]]. Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, now a peace-time leader, had declined in popularity within the party due to his left-wing domestic policies.{{sfn|Sawer|p=156}} The Commonwealth Line had been created by the Hughes government as a state-owned concern to ship Australian goods during World War I when British and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable. However its post-war existence was extensively criticised by Bruce as inappropriate and inefficient, and many of his economically conservative colleagues agreed.{{sfn|Fitzhardinge|pp=500\u2013501}} Bruce also distinguished himself as one of Australia's two representatives to the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 in [[Geneva]], at which he passionately advocated for [[disarmament]] and greater international cooperation, despite his general scepticism with regards to the League's mission and potential for success.{{sfn|Lee|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Treasurer, 1921\u20131923===\nReturning from Europe in October 1921, he was invited by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his government as [[Minister for Trade (Australia)|Minister for Trade and Customs]]. Bruce was not interested{{spaced ndash}} he was the head of one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious [[conflict of interest]] with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to [[Walter Massy-Greene]]. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=57\u201358}} Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=59\u201360}} Influential party figures such as Senator [[George Pearce]] and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=George Foster |title=Carpenter to Cabinet: Thirty-Seven Years of Parliament. |year=1951 |publisher=Hutchinson & Company Limited |location=London, UK |page=156}}</ref>\n\nBruce and Hughes clashed in both style and ideology. Bruce found Hughes' management of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=63\u201365}} But he served as a strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas.{{sfn|Treasury of Australia}} His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mr. Bruce and his Critics |author= |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1858670 |newspaper=The Argus |date=30 November 1922|page=8}}</ref> The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the [[1922 Australian federal election|1922 elections]] in December.{{sfn|Edwards|p=67}} Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=69\u201371}}\n\n==Prime Minister, 1923\u20131929==\n[[File:Nla1ndBruceMinistry.jpg|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Bruce's newly assembled ministry, 1923]]\nThe Nationalists lost eleven seats and their majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[1922 Australian federal election|election of 1922]]. Only three of these seats were picked up by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] though, and Labor still lacked the numbers to form government in their own right. Rather, a breakaway anti-Hughes [[Liberal Party (1922)|Liberal Party]] took five government seats, while the Country Party increased their number to 14 and now held the balance of power.{{sfn|Barber|p=27}} The only politically realistic option for the Nationalists to stay in office was to come to an agreement with the Country Party.  However, Country Party leader [[Earle Page]] refused to support a Nationalist government with Hughes as prime minister, and negotiations throughout January and February failed to break the impasse.{{sfn|Fitzhardinge|pp=511\u2013517}}  Rather than risk being defeated in the legislature, which might have resulted in the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] asking Labor to form government, Hughes surprised his colleagues by announcing his intention to resign on 2 February.{{sfn|Fitzhardinge|pp=515\u2013517}} With deputy leader [[Walter Massy-Greene]] having lost his seat at the 1922 election, Hughes now sent for Bruce to take over as leader of the party. After some reluctance, Bruce finally agreed, although Hughes later regretted the decision and became one of the new prime minister's most outspoken detractors.{{sfn|Lee|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Edwards|p=75}}\n\nBruce moved quickly to secure a working majority for his government. He convinced Hughes' long time political ally George Pearce to join his ministry and shored up the support of the other former [[National Labor Party|National Labor]] members of the Nationalist Party whom had walked out of the Labor Party with Hughes in 1916. He appointed William Watt as [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], effectively removing one of his key opponents from the benches, a tactical manoeuvre that became common in Australian politics thereafter.{{sfn|Reid & Forrest|pp=37\u201338}} But his most lasting political achievement was the negotiation of what became known as the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]{{spaced ndash}} an arrangement of electoral and political cooperation between the Nationalists (and their successors) and the Country Party. Although differing greatly in character and background, the orderly and diplomatic Bruce forged a strong working relationship with the intelligent but irascible Country Party leader Page.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=30\u201331}} Bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship, however.  As part of the Coalition agreement, the Country Party received five seats in a Cabinet of 11.

These two changes formed the ''Financial Agreement of 1927'', the provisions of which were approved by [[1928 Australian referendum|referendum in 1928]]. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence.{{sfn|Sawer|pp=131\u2013132}}{{sfn|Mathews|pp=9\u201319}} Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.{{sfn|Alexander|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n===Modernising government===\n[[File:Bruce opens Parliament House, Canberra.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce speaking at the opening of Parliament House, Canberra on 9 May 1927]]\nBruce set about applying his business principles to his cabinet, putting his experience as both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical.{{sfn|Hawkins|p=77}}{{sfn|Weller|pp=76\u201377}} He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members up to speed on the issue.

A record 22 [[Royal Commission]]s reported to the Bruce government, as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by the Commonwealth in a wide range of areas, particularly on economic, industrial and agricultural matters. Recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding the opportunities for agricultural and economic development in Australia, Bruce established the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), now known as the CSIRO.{{sfn|Edwards|p=126}} He established the Bureau of Economic Research in 1929 and for the first time economists were regularly employed to advise the government on what had been until then exclusively political issues.{{sfn|Hawkins|p=80}}{{sfn|Millmow|pp=147\u2013148}} By the time he left office, he had put in place extensive structures to provide information to the prime minister and the executive branch on most major areas of policy, a major development in the professional capacity of the Australian prime minister.{{sfn|Weller|pp=56\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Nla Bruce thelodge.jpg|thumb|left|Stanley and Ethel Bruce after moving into [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]], 1926]]\nUnder Bruce the Australian government also moved to its new permanent home in the planned federal city of [[Canberra]].

His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between Great Britain and her [[dominion]]s in a wide range of areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a common foreign policy. He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective decision-making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant ramifications for Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the [[Chanak Crisis]], British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|redefine its border with Greece]] had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey.

In a review of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1928, Bruce required industrial courts to consider the economic effects of its awards in addition to the welfare of worker.{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}} Immediate problems followed when a new award for waterside workers in 1928 worsened conditions for workers on economic grounds. New industrial action led by the [[Maritime Union of Australia|Waterside Workers Federation]] broke out. In Melbourne these turned to riots, claiming casualties and at least one fatality. Reviving the \"red scare\" pitch for the [[1928 Australian federal election|1928 election]] campaign, Bruce pushed the ''[[Transport Workers Act 1928|Transport Workers Act]]'' through parliament in response, which gave the executive unprecedented regulatory power in industrial relations.{{sfn|Sawer|p=265}} All waterfront workers now required federal licenses, or \"dog collars\" as they were derisively known, to work.{{sfn|Lee|p=79}} The act allowed the Commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation, earning the government deep unpopularity among organised labour.\n\nAt the 1928 election Bruce's government was returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine{{spaced ndash}} a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections.{{sfn|Barber|p=29}}{{sfn|Murray|p=119}} Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out.

Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis.

Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government failed to produce a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at [[Pelaw Main, New South Wales|Pelaw Main]] and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Turner|first=J.W.|title=Brown, John (1850\u20131930)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brown-john-5388|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref> Attorney-General [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]] pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate an end to the dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.{{sfn|Lee|pp=83\u201385}}\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and John Latham.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce with [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]], his Attorney-General and eventual successor as leader of the Nationalist Party]]\nBruce and the conservatives in parliament became increasingly convinced that \"economic deterioration [was] the product, rather than the possible cause, of worsening industrial relations.\"{{sfn|Plowman|p=54}} Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or the federal government would divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration.{{sfn|Lee|p=85}} The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce's own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=171\u2013172}} Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration.

Bruce assumed the presidency of the League of Nations Council in 1936 at the height of the crisis and after the failure of the [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact]] between France, Italy and Britain, but further attempts to forestall the invasion failed. He presided as League Council President during the [[Rhineland Crisis]], although once again attempts to respond to fascist aggression failed. Although this did not shake his conviction in the potential of the League, he saw it doomed to failure without fundamental reforms to its structure and system of sanctions.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=128\u2013129}} He was nominated by Turkey to chair the 1936 [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits|Montreux Conference]], which was far more successful in negotiating international agreement on passage through the [[Turkish Straits]]{{spaced ndash}} an issue of particular relevance to Bruce as a veteran of the Gallipoli campaign.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=129\u2013130}} Despite the turmoil of his presidency, the League historian F.P.

Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the international economy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=122\u2013123}} In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential.

The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 in the aftermath of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|partition of Czechoslovakia]] by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's [[appeasement]] policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation.

When Lyons died in April 1939, Earle Page and Richard Casey personally appealed for Bruce to return to Australia and take over once more as prime minister at the head of the UAP. Bruce demurred, however, and made it the condition of his return that he be allowed to sit in parliament as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and lead an all-party [[unity government]].

Churchill saw the dominions as still semi-dependent colonies who were at London's command<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Andrew|title=Empire Lost: Britain, the dominions and the Second World War|year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=1-84725-244-3|location=London, UK|page=41}}</ref> whereas Bruce saw the Empire as a kind of international partnership and the dominions as rightful parties to the decision-making process.{{sfn|Lee|p=137}} Britain's preoccupation with the European theatre alarmed Australian politicians, given the tenuous position of Far Eastern possessions and the looming possibility of Japanese invasion.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=180\u2013184}} After [[Pacific War|a string of defeats in the Far East]], particularly the [[Fall of Singapore]], the Australian government was finally successful in having Bruce accredited to the [[British War Cabinet]] and [[Pacific War Council]] as an Australian (and dominion) representative.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=196\u2013198}} \nHowever, Bruce soon became embroiled in the disputes over Churchill's autocratic leadership style and his lack of consultation with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure.{{sfn|P.G. Edwards|p = 52}} With the fear of [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|Japanese invasion]] mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill on a number of occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 275\u2013285}} Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Joe|title=The Commonwealth Office, 1925\u201368|year=1978|publisher=Heinemann|location=London, UK|isbn=0-435-32355-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217 217]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217}}</ref> Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 220}} In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers [[Clement Attlee]] and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from [[John Curtin]] and the other dominion prime ministers.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013176}}\n\n==Food and Agriculture Organization, 1946\u20131951==\n[[File:Pius XIII and the World Food Council 1950.JPG|thumb|[[Pope Pius XII]] with chairman Bruce and members of the World Food Council in Rome, 1950]]\nBy the war's end in 1945, Bruce had become tired of the High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's successor [[Ben Chifley]] that he would not object to being replaced in the position.{{sfn|Lee|p=162}} In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers{{spaced ndash}} the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]]{{spaced ndash}} that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters.{{sfn|Lee|pp=166\u2013168}} Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=280\u2013283}} The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that [[Franklin Roosevelt]] convened in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nAs the war in Europe drew to a close and the [[United Nations Charter]] was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce's name was among those being considered to become the first [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], with American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and [[British Foreign Minister]] Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=171\u2013172}} Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions.{{sfn|Hasluck|p=246}} In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a \"world food board\" to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a [[Food bank|world food reserve]] and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} Bruce's Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization, [[International aid|international development aid]], commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=January 1947 |title=PR.54}}</ref> The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.{{sfn|Lee|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nUndeterred, Bruce was elected Chairman of the newly formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute [[fertiliser]] and [[agricultural machinery]], as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 252}} More than two-thirds of the world was undernourished in 1949<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=13\u201324 June 1949 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=5\u201317 April 1948 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-war population boom]].<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=12\u201315 November 1951 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and [[Cold War]] conflicts multiplied.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 253}} Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 422\u2013423}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne.svg|thumb|Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne ''Or, a saltire gules cantoned between four mullets sable, on a chief of the second a pale argent charged with a saltire of the third''<ref>{{cite book |title=Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage |date=1963 |publisher=Kelly's Directories |page=199 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nBruce occupied a range of positions in his later years, sharing his time between the United Kingdom and Australia. He had been Chairman of the Finance Corporation of Industry since 1946 and continued in the role until 1957, providing finance to projects of benefit to the British national economy. Bruce helped establish the program in Australia in 1954 and on a Commonwealth basis in 1956.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=253\u2013256}} He became the first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the newly established [[Australian National University]] in 1952, and took an active interest in its development, especially as a research centre for the study of Asia and the Pacific.{{sfn|Lee|pp=180\u2013184}} Bruce concluded that Australia's position in the world had changed as a result of World War II, commenting:\n<blockquote>[Australia] has become a bridgehead between East and West. It is now vital that Australia should understand the problems of the East, that she should do whatever is in her power to alleviate those problems, and that she should interpret the nature of those problems to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bruce|first=Stanley|title=Notes from Bruce's Address as Chancellor|newspaper=Chancellor's Papers|date=October 1952|agency=Noel Butlin Archives|location=Australian National University}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe residential college Bruce Hall was named in his honour, and he remained active in the life of the university until his retirement from the position in 1961.{{sfn|Lee|pp=179\u2013182}} Bruce sat as director on many corporate boards in retirement, notably the [[National Bank of Australia]], [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and the National Mutual Life Association.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=253\u2013256}} In 1947 he became the first Australian to sit in the [[House of Lords]] ([[John Forrest|Sir John Forrest]] had been granted a peerage but died before it could be invested).<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanley Melbourne Bruce|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/media/images/bruce/index.aspx|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nHaving been elevated to the peerage as ''Viscount Bruce of Melbourne'' by long-time colleague Clement Attlee, he would be an active participant in the chamber, attending regularly right up until his death. Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=259\u2013262}} He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of [[Leander Club]], while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=448\u2013452}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Stanley Bruce bust.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Stanley Bruce by sculptor Wallace Anderson located in the [[Prime Ministers Avenue]] in the [[Ballarat Botanical Gardens]] in [[Ballarat]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]]]\nBruce remained active and in good health right through his retirement despite the gradual onset of [[deafness]], but the death of his wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him. He died on 25 August 1967 at the age of 84. He was the last surviving member of [[Billy Hughes]]' Cabinet. His memorial service was held at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] and was widely attended, including by representatives of the [[House of Windsor|Royal Family]].{{sfn|Cumpston|p=265}} His ashes were scattered over [[Lake Burley Griffin]] in Canberra.{{sfn|Lee|p=183}} The Canberra suburb of [[Bruce, Australian Capital Territory|Bruce]], and the electoral [[Division of Bruce]] based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bruce (Suburb)|url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/tools_resources/place_search2?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkYyMDMuOS4yNDkuMyUyRlBsYWNlTmFtZXMlMkZQbGFjZURldGFpbHMuYXNweCUzRm9iamVjdElEJTNENTM1MjkmYWxsPTE%3D|publisher=ACT Planning and Land Authority|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Division of Bruce|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/bruce.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and evaluation==\n{{See also|Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of Australia}}\nDespite his many accomplishments both at home and abroad, Bruce's post-prime ministerial career was not well known in Australia, and most still harboured memories of his harsh anti-union legislation and his government's landslide defeat in 1929.{{sfn|Lee|p=173}} His public persona was one of an aloof man, too English for Australia in style and bearing.{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}} Upon his death in 1967, ''[[The Age]]'' of his hometown Melbourne remarked that \"for most Australians, he is little more than a shadow.\"{{sfn|Stirling|pp=459\u2013460}} Bruce spent much of his life and career in the United Kingdom, the country that conversely held him in high regard, but never forgot his Australian roots and for much of his career was a tireless advocate for its interests. In contrast to his image as a member of the British aristocratic elite, he spent much of his later career working for solutions to the problems facing the world's poorest.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=458\u2013461}}\n\nBruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda{{spaced ndash}} as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition for these efforts.{{sfn|Henderson|p=352}} Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas. As Bruce himself would concede in later life, he was overly ambitious by nature and \"forever buying into things that aren't really my concern\".{{sfn|Stirling|p=488}} But despite his lack of public recognition in Australia, peers and historians have long recognised the abiding impact Bruce had both as prime minister and internationalist, leading his successor as Chancellor of the Australian National University Sir [[John Cockcroft]] to conclude in 1962 that Bruce was \"probably the outstanding Australian of our time\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Forgotten Man|newspaper=Sun Herald|date=15 April 1962|page=2}}</ref> The ''Melbourne Sun'' agreed with the assessment, stating upon his death that Bruce was \"probably the least remembered but the most extraordinary of our Prime Ministers\".{{sfn|Stirling|pp=459\u2013460}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[First Bruce Ministry]]\n*[[Second Bruce Ministry]]\n*[[Third Bruce Ministry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Biographies===\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Cumpston\n  | first = Ina Mary\n  | year = 1989\n  | title = Lord Bruce of Melbourne\n  | publisher = Longman Cheshire\n  | location = Melbourne\n  | isbn = 0-582-71274-2\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Cumpston}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Edwards\n  | first = Cecil\n  | year = 1965\n  | title = Bruce of Melbourne : Man of Two Worlds\n  | publisher = Heinemann\n  | location = London\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Edwards}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Fitzhardinge\n  | first = Laurence Frederic\n  | year = 1979\n  | title = William Morris Hughes: A Political Biography.

1967) was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by time in office|8th]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]], in office from 1923 to 1929. He made wide-ranging reforms and mounted a comprehensive nation-building program in government, but his controversial handling of industrial relations led to a dramatic [[1929 Australian federal election|defeat at the polls in 1929]]. Bruce later pursued a long and influential diplomatic career as [[List of High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom|High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] (1933\u20131945) and chairman of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (1946\u20131951).\n\nBorn into a briefly-wealthy [[Melbourne]] family, Bruce studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] and spent his early life tending to the importing and exporting business of his late father. He served on the front lines of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in World War I and returned to Australia wounded in 1917, becoming a spokesperson for government recruitment efforts. He gained the attention of the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]], who encouraged a political career. He was elected to [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]] in 1918, becoming [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] in 1921 and then prime minister in 1923, at the head of a coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]].\n\nIn office Bruce pursued an energetic and diverse agenda. He comprehensively overhauled federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to the new capital city of [[Canberra]]. He implemented various reforms to the [[Federalism in Australia|Australian federal system]] to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth, and helped develop the forerunners of the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the [[CSIRO]]. Bruce's \"men, money and markets\" scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand Australia's population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with Great Britain and the rest of the [[British Empire]]. However, his endeavours to overhaul Australia's industrial relations system brought his government into frequent conflict with the labour movement, and his radical proposal to abolish [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration|Commonwealth arbitration]] in 1929 prompted members of his own party to [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] to defeat the government. In the resounding loss at the [[1929 Australian federal election|subsequent election]] the prime minister lost his own seat, an event unprecedented in Australia and one that would not occur again until [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]].\n\nAlthough he returned to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the [[Lyons Government]] was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the [[League of Nations]], emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the [[developing world]]. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce was one of the key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the [[House of Lords]], as well as the first Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]]. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be returned to Canberra when he died.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Paterson, Laing and Bruce.jpg|thumb|left|The firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, 1900. John Bruce sits at the centre.]]\nStanley Melbourne Bruce was born on 15 April 1883 in [[St Kilda, Victoria]], a suburb of Melbourne, and was the youngest of five children.{{sfn|Carroll|p=105}} He disliked his given name and throughout his life preferred to be known by his initials \"S.M.\", even among close friends. His wife called him simply \"S\".{{sfn|Cumpston|p=1}}\n\nBruce's father, [[John Munro Bruce]], was born to Scottish parents in [[County Leitrim]], Ireland, and had emigrated to Australia in 1858 at the age of 18. His mother, Mary Ann Henderson, was Irish and had married her cousin John after emigrating to Australia in 1872 at the age of 24.{{sfn|Lee|pp=1\u20132}}  John Bruce became a talented businessman with \"a flair for buying and selling\",{{sfn|Lee|p=2}} which would secure him a partnership in an established Melbourne importing firm that in 1868 became known as Paterson, Laing and Bruce.{{sfn|Edwards|p=8}} As his wealth grew, John Bruce became influential in colonial Victoria's social and political life. An avid golfer, he was one of the founders of the [[Royal Melbourne Golf Club]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=9\u201310}} He was prominent in the [[Protectionist Party|liberal protectionist]] political movement within the state and an early supporter of future prime minister [[Alfred Deakin]]. John Bruce's success ensured that Stanley Bruce, his sister Mary and his brothers Ernest, William and Robert were born into affluence. Shortly after Stanley Bruce's birth the family relocated to the stately Wombalano manor, built by John Bruce, in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=8\u20139}} However, John Bruce was an aloof and remote figure in the lives of his children, as his son Stanley later recounted.{{sfn|Lee|p=3}} Despite their family's [[Presbyterian]] back-ground, Stanley Bruce was sent to Melbourne Church of England Grammar School (now [[Melbourne Grammar School]]) and subsequently Stanley Bruce would come to identify principally as [[Anglican]].{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}} Bruce was an average student but extremely active in the sporting life of the school and captain of its [[Australian rules football|football]] team, and then of the school itself in 1901. Today, the school honours him with his own house, Bruce House, the colours of which are scarlet and white. The house's mascot is a lion, symbolising Bruce's bravery.<ref>mgs.vic.edu.au</ref>{{sfn|Lee|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe economic depression of the 1880s and 1890s hit the Bruce family fortunes hard. John Bruce lost much of his fortune in the Victorian bank collapse of 1894 and incurred large debts to buy out his partners in the importing business in 1897.{{sfn|Stirling|p=162}} The family suffered a great deal more tragedy over the coming decades. Stanley's brother William committed suicide in 1899, shortly after seeking treatment for mental illness.{{sfn|Lee|p=4}} Just two years later John Bruce took his own life during a business trip to Paris; he had suffered from depression as a result of the great pressures on his business and finances.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}  His sister Mary endured a long illness before succumbing in 1908, and his mother died too in 1912. Finally, Bruce's beloved brother Ernest shot himself in 1919, suffering from physical and mental injuries sustained during his military service in World War I.{{sfn|Lee|pp=4\u20135}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of S.M. Bruce.png|left|upright|thumb|Bruce in the 1910s]]\nIn the aftermath of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, he moved to the United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in 1902.{{sfn|Lee|p=6}} He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including as a member of the Cambridge rowing crew that won the [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1904.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard D. Burnell|title=One Hundred and Fifty Years of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race: An Official History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_2BAAAAMAAJ&q|year=1979|publisher=Precision Press|location=Marlow, UK|page=104|isbn=978-0-9500638-7-4}}</ref> Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the [[Henley Royal Regatta]]) and write on the subject for much of his life.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=15\u201328}} Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered.{{sfn|Lee|pp=6\u20137}} During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a [[barrister]] in the London with the firm of [[Ashurst LLP|Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co]].{{sfn|Edwards|pp=16\u201317}} His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and [[Colombia]] in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}}\n\nBy 1912 Bruce was a businessman and a successful barrister, and it was in this year [[Ethel Bruce|Ethel Dunlop Anderson]] traveled to England and was reacquainted with Bruce, whom she had known as a child. Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatter]] family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce's interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Australian Dictionary of Biography}} Theirs was a close-knit relationship{{spaced ndash}} they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion.{{sfn|Lee|pp=8\u20139}} But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, and the fact that the Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce. His brother Ernest's daughter, Helen Bruce, came to play a large part in his life and was to become the main beneficiary of his Will but Bruce \"was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Military service==\n[[File:Sbruce.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Captain Bruce of the Royal Fusiliers during World War I]]\nBruce returned briefly to Australia in 1914, swapping positions within the company with his brother Ernest. World War I broke out in August of that year. Bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of the Empire, but all three of them would choose to serve in the British Army rather than the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]]. It was easier to obtain officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a close association with (and for many of them, long periods of residency in) Great Britain.{{sfn|Lee|p=9}} Bruce enlisted and received a commission as [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 7 February 1915<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=19 February 1915|issue=29079|page=1823|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29079/supplements/1823|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>  and was attached to the [[Royal Fusiliers|2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers]] in Egypt, which was then assigned to the [[British 29th Division]]. The 29th subsequently joined operations in Turkey along with [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]], commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] (MEF).{{sfn|Lee|p=10}} [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] had devised a strategy of capturing the [[Dardanelles]] from Turkey to allow naval access to Allied Russia. However [[Allies of World War I|allied naval forces]] were unable to secure passage through the narrow straits, and the MEF under Hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings. This was the beginning of the now infamous [[Gallipoli Campaign]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Moorehead|title=Gallipoli|year=2002|publisher=Harper Collins|location=Sydney|isbn=0-06-093708-4|pages=36\u201343}}</ref>\n\nBruce's regiment landed at [[Cape Helles]] in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished himself in the [[Trench warfare|construction of trenches]] and as an able commander.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=31\u201332}} His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose.{{sfn|Stirling|p=485}} He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at [[Suvla Bay]], where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the [[Military Cross]] and the [[Croix de Guerre]] for his service during these months,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=1 February 1916|issue=29460|page=1337|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29460/supplements/1337|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Second Supplement|journal=London Gazette|date=22 February 1916|issue=29486|page=2068|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/29486/supplements/2068|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> and rose to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 5 August.{{sfn|Lee|p=12}} He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}}\n\nAlthough it had been the agreement before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business.{{sfn|Edwards|p=33}} The [[War Office]] refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]],{{sfn|Carroll|p=106}} who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Third Supplement|issue=30123|page=5710|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/30123/supplement/5710|journal=London Gazette |date=9 June 1917}}</ref>\n\nHaving served with many of his countrymen he returned to Australia with a renewed sense of pride and mission in the country of his birth.{{sfn|Lee|p=13}} But having borne witness to the catastrophic loss of life in the Gallipoli Campaign and the death of most of his army comrades, as well as having suffered through the loss of most of his family, at age 34 Bruce was imbued with \"a driving ambition to make something of a life which providence had spared\".{{sfn|Lee|p=14}}\n\n==Early years in politics==\n\nBruce's popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him the attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]].{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} As Sir [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|William Irvine]] had recently resigned from parliament to become [[Chief Justice of Victoria]], there was to be [[1918 Flinders by-election|a by-election]] for his seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]] in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for.{{sfn|Lee|p=17}} The Nationalist [[preselection]] for the seat attracted many candidates, and [[Edward Fancourt Mitchell|Sir Edward Mitchell]], one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection with the help of the National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]] prevented the newly formed [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from [[Dandenong]] out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flinders By-Election: Declaration of Poll|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1660514|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=20 May 1918}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking to the delegates in Dandenong, Bruce summed up his political philosophy:\n<blockquote>A plain soldier and business man. I am no politician, nor have I any desire to be one. In the course of my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by the vast majority of the population.{{sfn|Lee|p=18}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and Billy Hughes, 1925.png|right|thumb|Billy Hughes, [[Herbert Pratten]] and Stanley Bruce]]\nBruce's early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on the affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. However, in 1921 he attracted the attention of his parliamentary colleagues over the matter of the [[Commonwealth Line]]. Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, now a peace-time leader, had declined in popularity within the party due to his left-wing domestic policies.{{sfn|Sawer|p=156}} The Commonwealth Line had been created by the Hughes government as a state-owned concern to ship Australian goods during World War I when British and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable. However its post-war existence was extensively criticised by Bruce as inappropriate and inefficient, and many of his economically conservative colleagues agreed.{{sfn|Fitzhardinge|pp=500\u2013501}} Bruce also distinguished himself as one of Australia's two representatives to the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 in [[Geneva]], at which he passionately advocated for [[disarmament]] and greater international cooperation, despite his general scepticism with regards to the League's mission and potential for success.{{sfn|Lee|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Treasurer, 1921\u201323===\nReturning from Europe in October 1921, he was invited by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his government as [[Minister for Trade (Australia)|Minister for Trade and Customs]]. Bruce was not interested{{spaced ndash}} he was the head of one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious [[conflict of interest]] with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to [[Walter Massy-Greene]].

In 1922, in what became known as the [[Chanak Crisis]], British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|redefine its border with Greece]] had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey.

Reviving the \"red scare\" pitch for the [[1928 Australian federal election|1928 election]] campaign, Bruce pushed the ''[[Transport Workers Act 1928|Transport Workers Act]]'' through parliament in response, which gave the executive unprecedented regulatory power in industrial relations.{{sfn|Sawer|p=265}} All waterfront workers now required federal licenses, or \"dog collars\" as they were derisively known, to work.{{sfn|Lee|p=79}} The act allowed the Commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation, earning the government deep unpopularity among organised labour.\n\nAt the 1928 election Bruce's government was returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine{{spaced ndash}} a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections.{{sfn|Barber|p=29}}{{sfn|Murray|p=119}} Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out.

Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government failed to produce a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at [[Pelaw Main, New South Wales|Pelaw Main]] and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Turner|first=J.W.|title=Brown, John (1850\u20131930)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brown-john-5388|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref> Attorney-General [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]] pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate an end to the dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.{{sfn|Lee|pp=83\u201385}}\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and John Latham.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce with [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]], his Attorney-General and eventual successor as leader of the Nationalist Party]]\nBruce and the conservatives in parliament became increasingly convinced that \"economic deterioration [was] the product, rather than the possible cause, of worsening industrial relations.\"{{sfn|Plowman|p=54}} Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or the federal government would divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration.{{sfn|Lee|p=85}} The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce's own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states.{{sfn|Edwards|pp=171\u2013172}} Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration.

Walters, ''A History of the League of Nations'', 1952, 833 pages, freely available on the site of the United Nations Office in Geneva [https://libraryresources.unog.ch/c.php?g=462663&p=3163196 online]</ref>\n\nBy 1937 Bruce's attention had shifted to social and economic cooperation, which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=129\u2013130}} He had taken a leading role in promoting agriculture, nutrition and economic cooperation through the League of Nations, working intensively with [[Frank McDougall]] and [[John Boyd Orr]] throughout the decade.{{sfn|Lee|pp=112\u2013113}} In 1937 he presented a plan of \"economic appeasement\", which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in Europe through better working conditions, lower food prices, rural credits and housing assistance. Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the international economy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=122\u2013123}} In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential. Foreshadowing the logic of the [[Marshall Plan]], Bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism.<ref>{{cite speech |title=Speech to the Second Committee of the League of Nations |author=Bruce, Stanley |date=19 September 1935 |location=Geneva}}</ref> [[File:Bruce chairing the Montreaux Conference.jpg|thumb|Bruce as Chairman of the Montreux Conference, 1938]]\n\n<blockquote>I feel very strongly that it will be impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position&nbsp;... it is vital for the prestige and future wellbeing of the League that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=150}}</blockquote>\n\nThe plan was supported by Secretary-General [[Joseph Louis Anne Avenol]], who like Bruce recognised that the League was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed, although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to the plan.{{sfn|Stirling|p=131}}{{sfn|Hudson|pp=172\u2013173}} Critically, new British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] could not be convinced by Bruce to invest further into the development of the League, and the body began to lose its political impetus as war loomed. He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 in the aftermath of the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|partition of Czechoslovakia]] by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's [[appeasement]] policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clavin|first=Patricia|authorlink=Patricia Clavin|title=Securing the World Economy: The Reinvention of the League of Nations, 1920\u20131946|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0-19-957793-5|pages=233\u2013251}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\nIn the events leading up to World War II, Bruce and Lyons had been supporters of the British under Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement exercised with regards to the [[reoccupation of the Rhineland]], the [[Anschluss]] and the [[Munich Crisis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bird|first=David|title=The 'Tame Tasmanian': Appeasement and Rearmament in Australia, 1932\u20131939|year=1993|publisher=A.W.Martin|isbn=1-74097-157-4|location=Melbourne|pages=262\u2013268}}</ref> Even during the \"[[phoney war]]\", Bruce continued to advocate the implementation of a more durable international system to enforce peace through mutual disarmament, the expansion of transnational trade, and global organizations capable of addressing the pressing social and economic questions that he felt were the recurrent causes of international conflict.{{sfn|Lee|p=138}} He had become a close confidant of senior Conservative Party figures [[Anthony Eden]] and Neville Chamberlain in this period,{{sfn|Stirling|p=60}} and was strident in advancing the opinion of Australia (and the dominions more broadly) that negotiation and compromise with Nazi Germany was preferable to war.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=157\u2013167}} Bruce actively participated in the negotiations for the [[Munich Agreement]]. When Lyons died in April 1939, Earle Page and Richard Casey personally appealed for Bruce to return to Australia and take over once more as prime minister at the head of the UAP. Bruce demurred, however, and made it the condition of his return that he be allowed to sit in parliament as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] and lead an all-party [[unity government]]. Such conditions were politically impossible to meet, and Robert Menzies [[1939 United Australia Party leadership election|was elected as the new leader of the UAP]].{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\n[[File:Stanley Bruce and the Troops.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|High Commissioner Bruce drinking tea with Australian troops in London during World War II]]\n[[Declaration of war by the United Kingdom|Britain's declaration of war]] against Germany on 3 September 1939 was followed within hours by Australia's Prime Minister Menzies stating that because of Britain's declaration Australia too was now at war with Germany.

He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure.{{sfn|P.G. Edwards|p = 52}} With the fear of [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|Japanese invasion]] mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill on a number of occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 275\u2013285}} Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Joe|title=The Commonwealth Office, 1925\u201368|year=1978|publisher=Heinemann|location=London, UK|isbn=0-435-32355-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217 217]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/commonwealthoffi0000garn/page/217}}</ref> Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 220}} In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers [[Clement Attlee]] and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from [[John Curtin]] and the other dominion prime ministers.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013176}}\n\n==Food and Agriculture Organization, 1946\u201351==\n[[File:Pius XIII and the World Food Council 1950.JPG|thumb|[[Pope Pius XII]] with chairman Bruce and members of the World Food Council in Rome, 1950]]\nBy the war's end in 1945, Bruce had become tired of the High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's successor [[Ben Chifley]] that he would not object to being replaced in the position.{{sfn|Lee|p=162}} In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers{{spaced ndash}} the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]]{{spaced ndash}} that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters.{{sfn|Lee|pp=166\u2013168}} Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=280\u2013283}} The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that [[Franklin Roosevelt]] convened in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.{{sfn|Lee|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nAs the war in Europe drew to a close and the [[United Nations Charter]] was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce's name was among those being considered to become the first [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], with American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and [[British Foreign Minister]] Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy.{{sfn|Lee|pp=171\u2013172}} Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions.{{sfn|Hasluck|p=246}} In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a \"world food board\" to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a [[Food bank|world food reserve]] and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need.{{sfn|Cumpston|p=250}} Bruce's Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization, [[International aid|international development aid]], commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=January 1947 |title=PR.54}}</ref> The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.{{sfn|Lee|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nUndeterred, Bruce was elected Chairman of the newly formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute [[fertiliser]] and [[agricultural machinery]], as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 252}} More than two-thirds of the world was undernourished in 1949<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=13\u201324 June 1949 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations.<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=5\u201317 April 1948 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with the [[Post-World War II baby boom|post-war population boom]].<ref>{{Cite report |author=Food and Agriculture Organization |date=12\u201315 November 1951 |title=FAO Council Report}}</ref> The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and [[Cold War]] conflicts multiplied.{{sfn|Cumpston|p = 253}} Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.{{sfn|Edwards|pp = 422\u2013423}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne.svg|thumb|Arms of Viscount Bruce of Melbourne ''Or, a saltire gules cantoned between four mullets sable, on a chief of the second a pale argent charged with a saltire of the third''<ref>{{cite book |title=Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage |date=1963 |publisher=Kelly's Directories |page=199 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nBruce occupied a range of positions in his later years, sharing his time between the United Kingdom and Australia.

Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating.{{sfn|Cumpston|pp=259\u2013262}} He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] in 1954.

In contrast to his image as a member of the British aristocratic elite, he spent much of his later career working for solutions to the problems facing the world's poorest.{{sfn|Stirling|pp=458\u2013461}}\n\nBruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda{{spaced ndash}} as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire.

The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition for these efforts.{{sfn|Henderson|p=352}} Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas.

{"title_page": "Examples of feudalism", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2008}}\n'''Examples of feudalism''' are helpful to fully understand [[feudalism]] and [[feudal society]]. Feudalism was practiced in many different ways, depending on location and time period, thus a high-level encompassing conceptual definition does not always provide a reader with the intimate understanding that detailed historical examples provide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Western European Feudalism==\n===12th century England===\n\nFeudalism in 12th century [[England]] was among the better structured and established in Europe at the time. However, it could be structurally complex, which is illustrated by the example of the [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] of [[Stafford]] as described in a survey  of knight's fees made in 1166 and recorded in ''The [[Black Book of the Exchequer]]''. This  was a  roll of parchment or several such,  recording the quantity and tenant of each knight's fee held ''in capite''. It was a record commissioned by the [[Treasury]] as the knight's fee was the primary basis for assessing certain types of taxation, for example, feudalism is the exchange of land for military service, thus everything was based on what was called the [[knight's fee]], which is a fiefdom or [[Estate (law)|estate of land]]. A [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] contained several knight's fees, for example the baron   [[Robert de Stafford|Robert of Stafford]] held a barony containing   60 knight's fees. Often lords were not so much lords presiding over great estates, but managers of a network of tenants and sub-leases.\n\nStafford tenants were themselves [[lord of the manor|lords of the manors]] they held from him, which is altogether different from their being [[English feudal barony|barons]]. Henry d'Oilly, who held 3 fees from Robert of Stafford, also held, as a [[tenant-in-chief]], over 30 fees elsewhere that had been granted to him directly by the king. Thus while Henry was the vassal of his overlord Robert, Henry was himself a lord of his own manors held [[Tenant-in-chief|''in capite'']] and [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] many of his manors which he did not keep [[Demesne|in demesne]], that is to say under his own management using simple employees. It would  also have been possible and not uncommon for a situation where Robert of Stafford was a vassal of Henry elsewhere, creating the condition of mutual lordship/vassalage between the two.  These complex relationships invariably created loyalty problems through conflicts of interests. To resolve this the concept of a [[liege lord]] existed, which meant that the vassal was loyal to his liege lord above all others, except the king himself,  no matter what. However, even this sometimes broke down when a vassal would pledge himself to more than one liege lord.\n\nFrom the perspective of the smallest land holder, multiple networks of tenancy were layered on the same small plot of land. A chronicle of the time says \"different lordships lay on the land in different respects\". Each tenant laid claim to a certain aspect of the service from the land.\n\n===11th century France===\nAmong the complexities of feudal arrangements, there existed no guarantee that contracts between [[lord]] and [[vassal]] would be honored, and feudal contracts saw little enforcement from those with greater authority. This often resulted in the wealthier and more powerful party taking advantage of the weaker.\n\nSuch was (allegedly) the case of [[Hugh IV of Lusignan|Hugh de Lusignan]] and his relations with his lord [[William V of Aquitaine]]. Between 1020 and 1025 Hugh wrote or possibly dictated a complaint against William and his vassals describing the unjust treatment he had received at the hands of both. Hugh describes a convoluted intermingling of loyalties that was characteristic of the period and instrumental in developing strain between nobles that resulted in competition for each other's land. According to Hugh's account, William wronged him on numerous occasions, often to the benefit of William's vassals. Many of his properties suffered similar fates: seized by opponents and divided between them and William. William apparently neglected to send military aid to Hugh when necessary and dealt most unfairly in the exchange of [[hostage]]s. Each time Hugh reclaimed one of his properties, William ordered him to return it to whomever had recently taken it from him. William broke multiple [[oath]]s in succession yet Hugh continued to put faith in his lord's word, to his own ruin. In his last contract with William, over possession of his uncle's castle at Chiza, Hugh dealt in no uncertain terms and with frank language:\n\n<blockquote>'''Hugh''': You are my lord, I will not accept a pledge from you, but I will simply rely on the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': Give up all those claims over which you have quarreled with me in the past and swear fidelity to me and my son and I will give you your uncle's honor [Chizes] or something else of equal value in exchange for it.<br />\n'''Hugh''': My lord, I beg you through God and this blessed crucifix which is made in the figure of Christ that you do not make me do this if you and your son were intending to threaten me with trickery.<br />\n'''William''': On my honor and my son I will do this without trickery.<br />\n'''Hugh''': And when I shall have sworn fidelity to you, you will demand Chizes castle of me, and if I should not turn it over to you, you will say that it is not right that I deny you the castle which I hold from you, and if I should turn it over to you, you and your son will seize it because you have given nothing in pledge except the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': We will not do that, but if we should demand it of you, don't turn it over to us.<ref name=\"Agreements Between Lord and Vassal\">Geary, P 2010, ''Readings in Medieval History, Fourth Edition'', University of Toronto, Toronto.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile perhaps an embellishment of the truth for the sake of Hugh's cause, and not necessarily a microcosm of the feudal system everywhere, the ''Agreement Between Lord and Vassal'' is evidence at least of corruption in feudal rule.\n\n===Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n\n===Portugal===\nPortugal, originally a part of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], was an example of a [[feudal society]], according to [[Marc Bloch]].<ref name=PortugalBloch/>\n\nPortugal has its roots in a feudal state in northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[County of Portugal]], established in 868 within the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. The [[V\u00edmara Peres]], the local counts dynasty, was suppressed in 1071, but twenty two years later, in 1093, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alphonse VI of L\u00e9on and Castille]] gave the county as a [[fiefdom]] to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] (a younger [[Capetian dynasty|Capet]] who was participating in the [[reconquista]]), when he married [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]], the king's natural daughter.\n\nIn spite of their [[vassal]] link, Henry had a remarkable autonomy, especially after his father-in law's death in 1109. The [[The establishment of the monarchy in Portugal|Portuguese independence]] was obtained by his son, [[Afonso I of Portugal]] when, after defeating the Muslims at the [[Battle of Ourique]], proclaimed himself [[Kings of portugal|King of Portugal]] in 1139, cutting definitively all feudal bonds with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. Upon seeing the weakness of feudal society due to the Muslim invasion, Portugal became independent from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n as Castile had done a century earlier.<ref name=PortugalBloch>[[Marc Bloch]], ''Feudal Society Vol.2'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd</ref>\n\n===North American colonies===\n\nSemi-feudal systems accompanied [[colonialism]] in some European settlements in North America:\n* [[Patroon]] system in [[New Netherland]], which lasted until the [[Anti-Rent War]] and the [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1846|New York Constitution of 1846]]\n* [[Seigneurial system of New France]] (now Canada), which was abolished in 1854 under British rule, though transitional rent payments persisted until 1970\n\n==\"Semi-feudal\" (non-Western European) feudalism==\nOutside of a medieval European historical context, the concept of feudalism is generally used by analogy (called '''semi-feudal'''), most often in discussions of [[Japan]] under the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'', and, sometimes, nineteenth-century [[Ethiopia]]. However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing it in places as diverse as [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Parthia|Parthian empire]], [[Indian feudalism|India]], and the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860)|American South of the nineteenth century]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire===\n{{Main|Pronoia}}\n[[Pronoia]], the 11th-century system of land grants in the [[Byzantine empire]], makes a useful contrast to feudal tenure in the European West. Another distinction between the European West can be made in that paroiki (people who lived and farmed on the land of the Pronoiars) owed no debt or loyalty to the pronoiars (the recipients of the Pronoia).<ref name=\"Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900-1200\">Harvey, Allen (1989) Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900\u20131200 pp.1\u201313</ref> This system was adopted by [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the fall of the Byzantine Empire at their hands, which called their land grants ''[[timar]]'' and the recipients of the land grants \"[[timariots]]\".\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Muscovite Manorialism}}\nIn contrast to Western [[Europe]] where feudalism created a strong central power, it took a strong central power to develop feudalism in Russia. A lack of true central power weakened and doomed the Russians to outside domination. The Russians developed its system of land/lord/worker, loosely called feudalism, after it had created a strong central power. Lacking a feudal system of [[vassal]] loyalty made it impossible for any prince, early on, to gain enough influence and power to project a strong force against any invaders.\n\nIn contrast to other European forms of [[serfdom]] and [[feudalism]] there was a lack of vassalage and loyalty to the lord whose land the serfs worked. It took a much longer period of time for feudalism to develop but when it did it took on a much harsher form than elsewhere in Europe. Serfs had no rights whatsoever; they could be traded like livestock by their lords. They had no ownership of anything, including their own families, all of which belonged to their lord.\n\nAnother major difference was the lack of independent principalities; this was due to the lack of vassalage. As separate lords did not command their own troops to protect their own lands.<ref name=\"Blum\">Blum, Jerome, Lord and Peasant in Russia. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961</ref>\n\n===Armenia===\n{{Main|Nakharar}}\nThe [[Nakharar]] system used by the [[Armenian nobility]] throughout [[Medieval Armenia]] has often been described as feudal, with hereditary houses of nobles owning large estates, each headed by its own [[tanuter]], and with the estates themselves divided amongst the family. For Armenia as a whole, a [[Sparapet]] (supreme commander), King, and chief [[Aspet]] were each taken from individual noble houses. However, Armenian feudalism differs from the feudalism of most of Europe as the estates were owned by families, not lords, and could not be split or given without the family's permission. Also, if a [[tanuter]] died heirless, he was succeeded by a different branch of the family, rather than by a noble who was sworn to him. [[Cilician Armenia]], through contact with [[crusader state]]s, had a system even closer to western feudalism.

Originally the system was introduced in the pre-colonial period to collect taxes from peasants, and it continued during colonial British rule. After independence Zamindari was abolished in [[India]] and East Pakistan (present day [[Bangladesh]]), but it is still present today in [[Pakistan]]. In modern times historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models and today it is rare for Zamindari to be described as feudal by academics; it still done in popular usage, however, but only for pejorative reasons to express disfavour, typically by critics of the system.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Feudalism in China}}\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] is officially a [[Communist state|Marxist\u2013Leninist society and state]], based on ''[[Socialism with Chinese Characteristics]]'' under a [[people's democratic dictatorship]],<!-- citations available via wikilinks --> and attempts have been made by Marxist academics to record China's history in the PRC.<ref>{{cite web|title=In China, Feudal Answers for Modern Problems|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/opinion/yu-in-china-feudal-answers-for-modern-problems.html|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Feudalism is the model that modern Chinese Marxists and [[Tokyo school]] historians use to identify China's recent past, [[Neologism|neologized]] from the Chinese concept of ''[[fengjian]]''<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\" /> (which means to allocate a region or piece of land to an individual, establishing him as the ruler of that region<ref>{{cite book|last=Levenson, Schurmann|first=Joseph, Franz|title=China-An Interpretive History: From the Beginnings to the Fall of Han|url=https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Regents of the University of California|location=London, England|isbn=0-520-01440-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve/page/34 34\u201336]}}</ref>), a term used to designate the multi-state which existed in China under the [[Zhou dynasty]], and was eradicated by the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]],<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\">{{cite book|author1=Timothy Brook|author2=Gregory Blue|title=China and Historical Capitalism: Genealogies of Sinological Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFF94exLscC&pg=PA136|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52591-6|page=136|ref=harv}}</ref> by which time the [[state of Qin]] had conquered all other states and established the [[Qin dynasty|first China-wide empire]]. After [[King Wu of Zhou]] defeated the [[Shang dynasty]], he created five hereditary ranks; \u516c ''g\u014dng'', \u4faf ''h\u00f3u'', \u4f2f ''b\u00f3'', \u5b50 ''z\u01d0'' and \u7537 ''n\u00e1n'', commonly translated as Duke, Marquis, Earl (or Count), Viscount and Baron. However, unlike their Western European equivalents, the titles often indicated more in the way of perceived nobility rather than amount of land possessed. For example, the Lords of the eventually huge states of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] were known as \"Earls\" and \"Viscounts\", while the Lord of [[Song (state)|Song]] was given the title of \"Duke\" on the merits of his descent from the previous Shang royal lineage, rather than his level of power.  Ancient Chinese texts can sometimes cause confusion as it was also considered to be polite to address rulers as ''g\u014dng'' regardless of their actual rank. As the Zhou dynasty's control weakened, the regional magnates caused further title inflation by referring to themselves as Kings; the inflation was such that under the [[Han dynasty]], many local lords were established with the title of \"king\"; in imperial China, the character is thus more normally rendered as \"prince\".\n\nThe [[Zhou Dynasty]] can be seen as a true feudal system as it is in many respects very similar to the system used in [[Medieval Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Zhou Dynasty|url=http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/whychina/zhou.php|website=China Education Center Limited|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> Each lord was given land, and his power was legitimised by nominal allegiance to the central Zhou king; politics thus revolved around these noble households. In fact, the notion of \"prime minister\" \u592a\u5bb0 in ancient Chinese came from the feudal time meaning the \"chief housekeeper\" or \"butler\" of the noble household, in a similar way to the development of such European titles as \"[[constable]]\". Each feudal state was governed independently with taxes, currency and laws set by each individual household, but the nobles were required to pay regular homage to the Zhou Kings as an act of [[fealty]]. At the time of war the nobles were required to provide armed service to the King.  Approaching the end of the [[Zhou dynasty]], the power of the King dwindled while the power of the nobles had risen. This resulted in what is known as the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States]] periods when the nobles fought each other constantly for supremacy. This resulted in the collapse of the noble ranking system, with the feudally organised society of the Springs and Autumns largely replaced by more bureaucratised states with standing armies, who no longer paid any attention to the Zhou.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gernet|first1=Jacques|title=Ancient China \u2013 from beginnings to Empire|date=1964|publisher=Faber & Faber|location=London|pages=99, 105\u20136, 115, 122}}</ref>\n\nAfter King Ying Zheng of Qin, known to posterity as the [[First Emperor of Qin]], defeated his rival states, deposing the Zhou and founding the [[Qin dynasty|first empire]], he formally abolished the largely defunct feudal system, replacing it with a bureaucratised system of literate civil servants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Loewe|first1=Michael|title=The Government of Qin and Han Empires|date=2006|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis|pages=21, 37, 41}}</ref> Despite the rapid collapse of the Qin and an abortive attempt at reinstitution of feudalism by [[Xiang Yu]], the following [[Han dynasty]] maintained the vast majority of his bureaucratic reforms, establishing them as the new standard of government for the next two thousand years of imperial Chinese history.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Mark|title=The Early Chinese Empires|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=53}}</ref> While Han Confucian scholarship would decry the First Emperor as a tyrant whose \"crimes against humanity\" included removing feudalism, looked back on as integral to the idealised society of the [[Western Zhou]], feudalism in the sense of devolved power for a military elite would not again be implemented in China.\n\n===Tibet===\n{{Main|Serfdom in Tibet controversy}}\nWhether Tibet constituted a feudal social system or if peasants can be considered serfs is still debated.<ref name=\"TibetBarnett\">Barnett, Robert (2008) ''What were the conditions regarding human rights in Tibet before democratic reform?'' in: Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China\u2019s 100 Questions, pp. 81\u201383.

In theory, this meant that the land was held under [[The Crown]] as ultimate feudal superior. Historically, [[The Crown]] would make a grant of land in return for military or other services and the grantees would in turn make sub-grants for other services and so on. Those making grants \u2013 the \"superiors\" \u2013 retained a legal interest in the land (\"dominium directum\"), and so a hierarchical structure was created with each property having a number of owners, co-existing simultaneously. Only one of these, the [[vassal]], has what in normal language would be regarded as ownership of the property (\"dominium utile\").\n\nThe [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] abolished the feudal system of land tenure in Scotland and replaced it with a system of outright ownership of land.  Since the Act became fully effective from 28 November 2004, the [[vassal]] owns the land outright, and superiority interests disappeared. The right of feudal superiors to enforce conditions was ended, subject to certain saving provisions of a restricted nature. [[Feu (land tenure)|Feu]] duty was abolished although compensation may be payable. The delay between [[royal assent]] and coming into force was a result of the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before final abolition and because of the close relation that the 2000 Act has to the Title Conditions Act 2003.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&pg=PA287|year=2002|publisher=Hart Publishing|page=287}}</ref>\n\n===England===\nUnique in England, the village of [[Laxton, Nottinghamshire|Laxton]] in [[Nottinghamshire]] continues to retain some vestiges of the feudal system, where the land is still farmed using the [[open field system]].

Feudalism was practiced in many different ways, depending on location and time period, thus a high-level encompassing conceptual definition does not always provide a reader with the intimate understanding that detailed historical examples provide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Western European Feudalism==\n===12th century England===\n\nFeudalism in 12th century [[England]] was among the better structured and established in Europe at the time. However, it could be structurally complex, which is illustrated by the example of the [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] of [[Stafford]] as described in a survey  of knight's fees made in 1166 and recorded in ''The [[Black Book of the Exchequer]]''. This  was a  roll of parchment or several such,  recording the quantity and tenant of each knight's fee held ''in capite''. It was a record commissioned by the [[Treasury]] as the knight's fee was the primary basis for assessing certain types of taxation, for example, feudalism is the exchange of land for military service, thus everything was based on what was called the [[knight's fee]], which is a fiefdom or [[Estate (law)|estate of land]]. A [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] contained several knight's fees, for example the baron   [[Robert de Stafford|Robert of Stafford]] held a barony containing   60 knight's fees. Often lords were not so much lords presiding over great estates, but managers of a network of tenants and sub-leases.\n\nStafford tenants were themselves [[lord of the manor|lords of the manors]] they held from him, which is altogether different from their being [[English feudal barony|barons]]. Henry d'Oilly, who held 3 fees from Robert of Stafford, also held, as a [[tenant-in-chief]], over 30 fees elsewhere that had been granted to him directly by the king. Thus while Henry was the vassal of his overlord Robert, Henry was himself a lord of his own manors held [[Tenant-in-chief|''in capite'']] and [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] many of his manors which he did not keep [[Demesne|in demesne]], that is to say under his own management using simple employees. It would  also have been possible and not uncommon for a situation where Robert of Stafford was a vassal of Henry elsewhere, creating the condition of mutual lordship/vassalage between the two.  These complex relationships invariably created loyalty problems through conflicts of interests. To resolve this the concept of a [[liege lord]] existed, which meant that the vassal was loyal to his liege lord above all others, except the king himself,  no matter what. However, even this sometimes broke down when a vassal would pledge himself to more than one liege lord.\n\nFrom the perspective of the smallest land holder, multiple networks of tenancy were layered on the same small plot of land. A chronicle of the time says \"different lordships lay on the land in different respects\". Each tenant laid claim to a certain aspect of the service from the land.\n\n===11th century France===\nAmong the complexities of feudal arrangements, there existed no guarantee that contracts between [[lord]] and [[vassal]] would be honored, and feudal contracts saw little enforcement from those with greater authority. This often resulted in the wealthier and more powerful party taking advantage of the weaker.\n\nSuch was (allegedly) the case of [[Hugh IV of Lusignan|Hugh de Lusignan]] and his relations with his lord [[William V of Aquitaine]]. Between 1020 and 1025 Hugh wrote or possibly dictated a complaint against William and his vassals describing the unjust treatment he had received at the hands of both. Hugh describes a convoluted intermingling of loyalties that was characteristic of the period and instrumental in developing strain between nobles that resulted in competition for each other's land. According to Hugh's account, William wronged him on numerous occasions, often to the benefit of William's vassals. Many of his properties suffered similar fates: seized by opponents and divided between them and William. William apparently neglected to send military aid to Hugh when necessary and dealt most unfairly in the exchange of [[hostage]]s. Each time Hugh reclaimed one of his properties, William ordered him to return it to whomever had recently taken it from him. William broke multiple [[oath]]s in succession yet Hugh continued to put faith in his lord's word, to his own ruin. In his last contract with William, over possession of his uncle's castle at Chiza, Hugh dealt in no uncertain terms and with frank language:\n\n<blockquote>'''Hugh''': You are my lord, I will not accept a pledge from you, but I will simply rely on the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': Give up all those claims over which you have quarreled with me in the past and swear fidelity to me and my son and I will give you your uncle's honor [Chizes] or something else of equal value in exchange for it.<br />\n'''Hugh''': My lord, I beg you through God and this blessed crucifix which is made in the figure of Christ that you do not make me do this if you and your son were intending to threaten me with trickery.<br />\n'''William''': On my honor and my son I will do this without trickery.<br />\n'''Hugh''': And when I shall have sworn fidelity to you, you will demand Chizes castle of me, and if I should not turn it over to you, you will say that it is not right that I deny you the castle which I hold from you, and if I should turn it over to you, you and your son will seize it because you have given nothing in pledge except the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': We will not do that, but if we should demand it of you, don't turn it over to us.<ref name=\"Agreements Between Lord and Vassal\">Geary, P 2010, ''Readings in Medieval History, Fourth Edition'', University of Toronto, Toronto.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile perhaps an embellishment of the truth for the sake of Hugh's cause, and not necessarily a microcosm of the feudal system everywhere, the ''Agreement Between Lord and Vassal'' is evidence at least of corruption in feudal rule.\n\n===Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n\n===Portugal===\nPortugal, originally a part of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], was an example of a [[feudal society]], according to [[Marc Bloch]].<ref name=PortugalBloch/>\n\nPortugal has its roots in a feudal state in northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[County of Portugal]], established in 868 within the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. The [[V\u00edmara Peres]], the local counts dynasty, was suppressed in 1071, but twenty two years later, in 1093, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alphonse VI of L\u00e9on and Castille]] gave the county as a [[fiefdom]] to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] (a younger [[Capetian dynasty|Capet]] who was participating in the [[reconquista]]), when he married [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]], the king's natural daughter.\n\nIn spite of their [[vassal]] link, Henry had a remarkable autonomy, especially after his father-in law's death in 1109. The [[The establishment of the monarchy in Portugal|Portuguese independence]] was obtained by his son, [[Afonso I of Portugal]] when, after defeating the Muslims at the [[Battle of Ourique]], proclaimed himself [[Kings of portugal|King of Portugal]] in 1139, cutting definitively all feudal bonds with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. Upon seeing the weakness of feudal society due to the Muslim invasion, Portugal became independent from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n as Castile had done a century earlier.<ref name=PortugalBloch>[[Marc Bloch]], ''Feudal Society Vol.2'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd</ref>\n\n===North American colonies===\n\nSemi-feudal systems accompanied [[colonialism]] in some European settlements in North America:\n* [[Patroon]] system in [[New Netherland]], which lasted until the [[Anti-Rent War]] and the [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1846|New York Constitution of 1846]]\n* [[Seigneurial system of New France]] (now Canada), which was abolished in 1854 under British rule, though transitional rent payments persisted until 1970\n\n==\"Semi-feudal\" (non-Western European) feudalism==\nOutside of a medieval European historical context, the concept of feudalism is generally used by analogy (called '''semi-feudal'''), most often in discussions of [[Japan]] under the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'', and, sometimes, nineteenth-century [[Ethiopia]]. However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing it in places as diverse as [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Parthia|Parthian empire]], [[Indian feudalism|India]], and the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860)|American South of the nineteenth century]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire===\n{{Main|Pronoia}}\n[[Pronoia]], the 11th-century system of land grants in the [[Byzantine empire]], makes a useful contrast to feudal tenure in the European West. Another distinction between the European West can be made in that paroiki (people who lived and farmed on the land of the Pronoiars) owed no debt or loyalty to the pronoiars (the recipients of the Pronoia).<ref name=\"Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900-1200\">Harvey, Allen (1989) Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900\u20131200 pp.1\u201313</ref> This system was adopted by [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the fall of the Byzantine Empire at their hands, which called their land grants ''[[timar]]'' and the recipients of the land grants \"[[timariots]]\".\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Muscovite Manorialism}}\nIn contrast to Western [[Europe]] where feudalism created a strong central power, it took a strong central power to develop feudalism in Russia. A lack of true central power weakened and doomed the Russians to outside domination. The Russians developed its system of land/lord/worker, loosely called feudalism, after it had created a strong central power. Lacking a feudal system of [[vassal]] loyalty made it impossible for any prince, early on, to gain enough influence and power to project a strong force against any invaders.\n\nIn contrast to other European forms of [[serfdom]] and [[feudalism]] there was a lack of vassalage and loyalty to the lord whose land the serfs worked. It took a much longer period of time for feudalism to develop but when it did it took on a much harsher form than elsewhere in Europe. Serfs had no rights whatsoever; they could be traded like livestock by their lords. They had no ownership of anything, including their own families, all of which belonged to their lord.\n\nAnother major difference was the lack of independent principalities; this was due to the lack of vassalage. As separate lords did not command their own troops to protect their own lands.<ref name=\"Blum\">Blum, Jerome, Lord and Peasant in Russia. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961</ref>\n\n===Armenia===\n{{Main|Nakharar}}\nThe [[Nakharar]] system used by the [[Armenian nobility]] throughout [[Medieval Armenia]] has often been described as feudal, with hereditary houses of nobles owning large estates, each headed by its own [[tanuter]], and with the estates themselves divided amongst the family. For Armenia as a whole, a [[Sparapet]] (supreme commander), King, and chief [[Aspet]] were each taken from individual noble houses. However, Armenian feudalism differs from the feudalism of most of Europe as the estates were owned by families, not lords, and could not be split or given without the family's permission. Also, if a [[tanuter]] died heirless, he was succeeded by a different branch of the family, rather than by a noble who was sworn to him. [[Cilician Armenia]], through contact with [[crusader state]]s, had a system even closer to western feudalism.

Originally the system was introduced in the pre-colonial period to collect taxes from peasants, and it continued during colonial British rule. After independence Zamindari was abolished in [[India]] and East Pakistan (present day [[Bangladesh]]), but it is still present today in [[Pakistan]]. In modern times historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models and today it is rare for Zamindari to be described as feudal by academics; it still done in popular usage, however, but only for pejorative reasons to express disfavour, typically by critics of the system.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Feudalism in China}}\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] is officially a [[Communist state|Marxist\u2013Leninist society and state]], based on ''[[Socialism with Chinese Characteristics]]'' under a [[people's democratic dictatorship]],<!-- citations available via wikilinks --> and attempts have been made by Marxist academics to record China's history in the PRC.<ref>{{cite web|title=In China, Feudal Answers for Modern Problems|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/opinion/yu-in-china-feudal-answers-for-modern-problems.html|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Feudalism is the model that modern Chinese Marxists and [[Tokyo school]] historians use to identify China's recent past, [[Neologism|neologized]] from the Chinese concept of ''[[fengjian]]''<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\" /> (which means to allocate a region or piece of land to an individual, establishing him as the ruler of that region<ref>{{cite book|last=Levenson, Schurmann|first=Joseph, Franz|title=China-An Interpretive History: From the Beginnings to the Fall of Han|url=https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Regents of the University of California|location=London, England|isbn=0-520-01440-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve/page/34 34\u201336]}}</ref>), a term used to designate the multi-state which existed in China under the [[Zhou dynasty]], and was eradicated by the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]],<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\">{{cite book|author1=Timothy Brook|author2=Gregory Blue|title=China and Historical Capitalism: Genealogies of Sinological Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFF94exLscC&pg=PA136|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52591-6|page=136|ref=harv}}</ref> by which time the [[state of Qin]] had conquered all other states and established the [[Qin dynasty|first China-wide empire]]. After [[King Wu of Zhou]] defeated the [[Shang dynasty]], he created five hereditary ranks; \u516c ''g\u014dng'', \u4faf ''h\u00f3u'', \u4f2f ''b\u00f3'', \u5b50 ''z\u01d0'' and \u7537 ''n\u00e1n'', commonly translated as Duke, Marquis, Earl (or Count), Viscount and Baron. However, unlike their Western European equivalents, the titles often indicated more in the way of perceived nobility rather than amount of land possessed. For example, the Lords of the eventually huge states of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] were known as \"Earls\" and \"Viscounts\", while the Lord of [[Song (state)|Song]] was given the title of \"Duke\" on the merits of his descent from the previous Shang royal lineage, rather than his level of power.  Ancient Chinese texts can sometimes cause confusion as it was also considered to be polite to address rulers as ''g\u014dng'' regardless of their actual rank. As the Zhou dynasty's control weakened, the regional magnates caused further title inflation by referring to themselves as Kings; the inflation was such that under the [[Han dynasty]], many local lords were established with the title of \"king\"; in imperial China, the character is thus more normally rendered as \"prince\".\n\nThe [[Zhou Dynasty]] can be seen as a true feudal system as it is in many respects very similar to the system used in [[Medieval Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Zhou Dynasty|url=http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/whychina/zhou.php|website=China Education Center Limited|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> Each lord was given land, and his power was legitimised by nominal allegiance to the central Zhou king; politics thus revolved around these noble households. In fact, the notion of \"prime minister\" \u592a\u5bb0 in ancient Chinese came from the feudal time meaning the \"chief housekeeper\" or \"butler\" of the noble household, in a similar way to the development of such European titles as \"[[constable]]\". Each feudal state was governed independently with taxes, currency and laws set by each individual household, but the nobles were required to pay regular homage to the Zhou Kings as an act of [[fealty]]. At the time of war the nobles were required to provide armed service to the King.  Approaching the end of the [[Zhou dynasty]], the power of the King dwindled while the power of the nobles had risen. This resulted in what is known as the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States]] periods when the nobles fought each other constantly for supremacy. This resulted in the collapse of the noble ranking system, with the feudally organised society of the Springs and Autumns largely replaced by more bureaucratised states with standing armies, who no longer paid any attention to the Zhou.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gernet|first1=Jacques|title=Ancient China \u2013 from beginnings to Empire|date=1964|publisher=Faber & Faber|location=London|pages=99, 105\u20136, 115, 122}}</ref>\n\nAfter King Ying Zheng of Qin, known to posterity as the [[First Emperor of Qin]], defeated his rival states, deposing the Zhou and founding the [[Qin dynasty|first empire]], he formally abolished the largely defunct feudal system, replacing it with a bureaucratised system of literate civil servants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Loewe|first1=Michael|title=The Government of Qin and Han Empires|date=2006|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis|pages=21, 37, 41}}</ref> Despite the rapid collapse of the Qin and an abortive attempt at reinstitution of feudalism by [[Xiang Yu]], the following [[Han dynasty]] maintained the vast majority of his bureaucratic reforms, establishing them as the new standard of government for the next two thousand years of imperial Chinese history.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Mark|title=The Early Chinese Empires|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=53}}</ref> While Han Confucian scholarship would decry the First Emperor as a tyrant whose \"crimes against humanity\" included removing feudalism, looked back on as integral to the idealised society of the [[Western Zhou]], feudalism in the sense of devolved power for a military elite would not again be implemented in China.\n\n===Tibet===\n{{Main|Serfdom in Tibet controversy}}\nWhether Tibet constituted a feudal social system or if peasants can be considered serfs is still debated.<ref name=\"TibetBarnett\">Barnett, Robert (2008) ''What were the conditions regarding human rights in Tibet before democratic reform?'' in: Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China\u2019s 100 Questions, pp. 81\u201383.

In theory, this meant that the land was held under [[The Crown]] as ultimate feudal superior. Historically, [[The Crown]] would make a grant of land in return for military or other services and the grantees would in turn make sub-grants for other services and so on. Those making grants \u2013 the \"superiors\" \u2013 retained a legal interest in the land (\"dominium directum\"), and so a hierarchical structure was created with each property having a number of owners, co-existing simultaneously. Only one of these, the [[vassal]], has what in normal language would be regarded as ownership of the property (\"dominium utile\").\n\nIn the 18th century, peasants were dispossessed of the land to which they were bonded.<ref>[[Thomas Douglas Selkirk]] (1805) ''[https://archive.org/details/observationsonp00selkgoog Observations on the Present State of the Highlands of Scotland]'' pp.31\u201354,</ref>\n\nThe [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] abolished the feudal system of land tenure in Scotland and replaced it with a system of outright ownership of land.

The high frequency of tornadoes in North America is largely due to geography, as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is easily advected into the midcontinent with few topographic barriers in the way. The [[Rocky Mountains]] block Pacific-sourced moisture and buckle the [[prevailing winds|atmospheric flow]], forcing drier air at mid-levels of the [[troposphere]] due to downsloping winds and causing [[cyclogenesis]] downstream to the east of the mountains. Downsloping winds off the Rockies force the formation of a [[dry line]] when the flow aloft is strong, while the [[Gulf of Mexico]] fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. This area extends into Canada, particularly [[Ontario]] and the [[Prairie Provinces]], and strong tornadoes can also occur in northern Mexico.\n\nA large region of South America is characterized by storms that reach the level of supercells and produce intense hailstorms, floods, and tornadoes during the spring, summer, and early fall. The region recently appointed as the [[:es:Pasillo de los Tornados|Tornado Corridor]] (South America) is considered as the second largest in the world in terms of the formation of extreme weather events. It covers most of central Argentina, southern Paraguay, southeastern Brazil, and Uruguay.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nBangladesh and surrounding areas of eastern India suffer from a couple tornadoes annually of similar severity to stronger tornadoes in the US. These occur with a greater recurrence interval (although over a smaller region), and tend to be under-reported due to the scarcity of media coverage of a developing country. The annual human death toll from tornadoes in Bangladesh is estimated at about 179 deaths per year, which is much greater than in the US. This is likely due to the density of population, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge and warnings, and other factors.<ref name=\"Bangladesh tornado\">{{cite web| url = http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/qr/qr169/qr169.pdf| title = The April 2004 Tornado in North-Central Bangladesh: A Case for Introducing Tornado Forecasting and Warning Systems| accessdate = 2006-08-17| author = Paul, Bhuiyan| year = 2004}}</ref>\n\nOther areas of the world that have frequent strong tornadoes include Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, China, and [[the Philippines]]. Australia, France, Russia, areas of the Middle East, Japan, and parts of Mexico have a history of multiple damaging tornado events.\n\n== Tornadoes in the United States ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}\n\n[[File:Improved Average Annual Tornado Reports.svg|thumb|350px|right|Average annual tornado reports in the United States]]\n\n{{further|Tornadoes in the United States}}\n\nThe United States averaged 1,274 tornadoes per year in the last decade. April 2011 saw the most tornadoes ever recorded for any month in the US [[National Weather Service]]'s history, 875; the previous record was 542 in one month.<ref name=\"noaanews.noaa.gov\">http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/2011_tornado_information.html</ref> It has more tornadoes yearly than any other country and reports more violent (F4 and F5) tornadoes than anywhere else.\n\nTornadoes are common in many states but are most common to the west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and to the east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. The Atlantic seaboard states \u2013 [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Virginia]] \u2013 are also very vulnerable, as well as Florida. The areas most vulnerable to tornadoes are the Southern Plains and Florida, though most Florida tornadoes are relatively weak. The [[Southern United States]] is one of the worst-affected regions in terms of casualties.\n\nTornado reports have been officially collated since 1950.  These reports have been gathered by the [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC), based in [[Asheville]], North Carolina.  A tornado can be reported more than once, such as when a storm crosses a county line and reports are made from two counties.\n\n=== Common misconceptions ===\nSome people mistakenly believe that tornadoes only occur in the countryside.  This is hardly the case.  While it is true that the [[Great Plains|plains states]] are tornado-prone, tornadoes have been reported in every U.S state, including [[Alaska]] and Hawaii.  One likely reason tornadoes are so common in the central U.S is because this is where Arctic air, cold fronts that have not been \"weakened\" yet first collide with warm tropical air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  As these fronts head further east, they sometimes lose their strength as they travel over more warm air.  For this reason, tornadoes are not as common on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] as they are in the Midwest. However, they have happened on rare occasion, such as the F3 twister that struck [[Limerick Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Limerick Township, Pennsylvania]] near Philadelphia on 27 July 1994,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://media.pottsmerc.com/2014/07/30/1994-limerick-tornado/#1}}</ref> the F2 twister that struck the northern suburbs of New York City on 12 July 2006,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/14/nyregion/14storm.html?ex=1153022400&en=6f91606b06e86635&ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | first=Anahad | last=O'Connor | title=It's Official: That Severe Storm in Westchester Was a Tornado | date=14 July 2006}}</ref> the EF2 twister in the borough of [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] on 8 August 2007, or the F4 twister that [[La Plata, Maryland#Tornado history|struck La Plata, Maryland]] on 28 April 2002.\n\nTornadoes can occur west of the [[continental divide]], but they are infrequent and usually relatively weak and short-lived.  Recently, tornadoes have struck the Pacific coast town of [[Lincoln City, Oregon|Lincoln City]], Oregon (1996), [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], California (1998), [[Port Orchard, Washington|Port Orchard]], Washington (2018), and downtown [[Salt Lake City]], Utah (1999 - see [[Salt Lake City Tornado]]). The [[California Central Valley]] is an area of some frequency for tornadoes, albeit of weak intensity. Though tornadoes that occur on the Western Seaboard are typically weak, more powerful and damaging tornadoes, such as the tornado that occurred on 22 May 2008 in Perris, California, can also occur.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/23/local/me-weather23 | work=The Los Angeles Times | first=David| last=Reyes | title=Tornadoes, hail and snow deliver a May surprise| date=23 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nMore tornadoes occur in [[Texas]] than in any other US state. The state which has the highest number of tornadoes per unit area is Florida, although most of the tornadoes in Florida are weak tornadoes of EF0 or EF1 intensity. A number of Florida's tornadoes occur along the edge of [[hurricane]]s that strike the state. The state with the highest number of strong tornadoes per unit area is [[Oklahoma]]. The neighboring state of [[Kansas]] is also a particularly notorious tornado state. It records the most EF4 and EF5 tornadoes in the country.\n\n== Tornadoes in Canada ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}\nCanada also experiences numerous tornadoes, although fewer than the United States.

For example, a freak tornado hit South St. Louis County Missouri on 31 December 2010, causing pockets of heavy damage to a modest area before dissipating. The temperature was unseasonably warm that day. They are least common during the winter and most common in spring. Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes in the late summer and fall can also be caused by hurricane landfall.\n\nNot every [[thunderstorm]], [[supercell]], [[squall|squall line]], or [[tropical cyclone]] will produce a tornado. Precisely the right atmospheric conditions are required for the formation of even a weak tornado. On the other hand, 700 or more tornadoes a year are reported in the contiguous United States.\n\nOn average, the United States experiences 100,000 thunderstorms each year, resulting in more than 1,200 tornadoes and approximately 50 deaths per year.  The deadliest U.S. tornado recorded is the 18 March 1925, [[Tri-State Tornado]] that swept across southeastern [[Missouri]], southern [[Illinois]] and southern [[Indiana]], killing 695 people. The biggest [[tornado outbreak]] on record\u2014with 353 tornadoes over the course of just 3 1/2 days, including four EF5 and eleven EF4 tornadoes\u2014occurred starting on 25 April 2011 and intensifying on 26 April and especially the record-breaking day of 27 April before ending on 28 April. It is referred to as the [[2011 Super Outbreak]]. Previously, the record was 148 tornadoes, dubbed the [[1974 Super Outbreak]]. Another such significant storm system was the [[Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1965]], which affected the United States Midwest on 11 April 1965. A series of continuous tornado outbreaks is known as a [[tornado outbreak sequence]], with significant occurrences in May 1917, 1930, 1949, and 2003.\n\n== Time of occurrence ==\n\n=== Diurnality ===\nTornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day.\n<ref name=\"tornado time of day\"/> Austria, Finland, Germany, and the United States'<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Bluestein]] of the [[University of Oklahoma]], have referred to this phenomenon as \"five o'clock magic.\" Despite this, there are several morning tornadoes reported, like the [[Seymour, Texas|Seymour]], Texas one in April 1980.\n\n=== Seasonality ===\nThe time of year is a big factor of the intensity and frequency of tornadoes. On average, in the United States as a whole, the month with the most tornadoes is May, followed by the months June, April, and July. There is no \"tornado season\" though, as tornadoes, including violent tornadoes and major outbreaks, can and do occur anywhere at any time of year if favorable conditions develop. Major tornado outbreaks have occurred in every month of the year.\n\nJuly is the peak month in Austria, Finland, and Germany.<ref>Jenni Teittinen. [http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/115319.pdf A Climatology of Tornadoes in Finland.] Retrieved on 2006-10-25.</ref> On average, there are around 294 tornadoes throughout the United States during the month of May, and as many as 543 tornadoes have been reported in the month of May alone (in 2003). The months with the fewest tornadoes are usually December and January, although major tornado outbreaks can and sometimes do occur even in those months. In general, in the Midwestern and Plains states, springtime (especially the month of May) is the most active season for tornadoes, while in the far northern states (like [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]), the peak tornado season is usually in the summer months (June and July). In the colder late autumn and winter months (from early December to late February), tornado activity is generally limited to the southern states, where it is possible for warm Gulf of Mexico air to penetrate.\n\nThe reason for the peak period for tornado formation being in the spring has much to do with temperature patterns in the U.S. Tornadoes often form when cool, polar air traveling southeastward from the Rockies overrides warm, moist, unstable [[Gulf of Mexico]] air in the eastern states. Tornadoes therefore tend to be commonly found in front of a cold front, along with heavy rains, hail, and damaging winds.  Since both warm and cold weather are common during the springtime, the conflict between these two air masses tends to be most common in the spring. As the weather warms across the country, the occurrence of tornadoes spreads northward. Tornadoes are also common in the summer and early fall because they can also be triggered by hurricanes, although the tornadoes caused by hurricanes are often much weaker and harder to spot. Winter is the least common time for tornadoes to occur, since hurricane activity is virtually non-existent at this time, and it is more difficult for warm, moist maritime tropical air to take over the frigid Arctic air from Canada, occurrences are found mostly in the Gulf states and Florida during winter (although there have been some notable exceptions). There is a second active tornado season of the year, late October to mid-November. Autumn, like spring, is a time of the year when warm weather alternates with cold weather frequently, especially in the Midwest, but the season is not as active as it is during the springtime and tornado frequencies are higher along the Atlantic Coastal plain as opposed to the Midwest. They usually appear in late summer.\n\n== Long-term trends ==\n[[File:Tornado-counts-1976-2011.png|thumb|U. S.

Also, the 1980s seemed to be a period of unusually low tornado activity in the United States, and the number of multi-death tornadoes decreased every decade from the 1920s to the 1980s, suggesting a multi-decadal pattern of some sort.<ref>Grazulis, 196\u2013198</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tornado intensity and damage]]\n* [[Tornado records]]\n* [[List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]\n* [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes]]\n* [[List of tornadoes by calendar day]]\n* [[Tornadogenesis]]\n* [[Tornado myths]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Book references ===\n* {{Cite book | last = Grazulis | first = Thomas P | title = Significant Tornadoes 1680\u20131991 | date = July 1993 | publisher = The Tornado Project of Environmental Films | location = St. Johnsbury, VT | isbn = 978-1-879362-03-1 }}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite conference |first= Harold E. |last= Brooks |authorlink= Harold E.

The high frequency of tornadoes in North America is largely due to geography, as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is easily advected into the midcontinent with few topographic barriers in the way. The [[Rocky Mountains]] block Pacific-sourced moisture and buckle the [[prevailing winds|atmospheric flow]], forcing drier air at mid-levels of the [[troposphere]] due to downsloping winds and causing [[cyclogenesis]] downstream to the east of the mountains. Downsloping winds off the Rockies force the formation of a [[dry line]] when the flow aloft is strong, while the [[Gulf of Mexico]] fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. This area extends into Canada, particularly [[Ontario]] and the [[Prairie Provinces]], and strong tornadoes can also occur in northern Mexico.\n\nA large region of South America is characterized by storms that reach the level of supercells and produce intense hailstorms, floods, and tornadoes during the spring, summer, and early fall. The region recently appointed as the [[:es:Pasillo de los Tornados|Tornado Corridor]] (South America) is considered as the second largest in the world in terms of the formation of extreme weather events. It covers most of central Argentina, southern Paraguay, southeastern Brazil, and Uruguay.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nBangladesh and surrounding areas of eastern India suffer from a couple tornadoes annually of similar severity to stronger tornadoes in the US. These occur with a greater recurrence interval (although over a smaller region), and tend to be under-reported due to the scarcity of media coverage of a developing country. The annual human death toll from tornadoes in Bangladesh is estimated at about 179 deaths per year, which is much greater than in the US. This is likely due to the density of population, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge and warnings, and other factors.<ref name=\"Bangladesh tornado\">{{cite web| url = http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/qr/qr169/qr169.pdf| title = The April 2004 Tornado in North-Central Bangladesh: A Case for Introducing Tornado Forecasting and Warning Systems| accessdate = 2006-08-17| author = Paul, Bhuiyan| year = 2004}}</ref>\n\nOther areas of the world that have frequent strong tornadoes include Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, China, and [[the Philippines]].

The Atlantic seaboard states \u2013 [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Virginia]] \u2013 are also very vulnerable, as well as Florida. The areas most vulnerable to tornadoes are the Southern Plains and Florida, though most Florida tornadoes are relatively weak. The [[Southern United States]] is one of the worst-affected regions in terms of casualties.\n\nTornado reports have been officially collated since 1950.  These reports have been gathered by the [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC), based in [[Asheville]], North Carolina.  A tornado can be reported more than once, such as when a storm crosses a county line and reports are made from two counties.\n\n=== Common misconceptions ===\nSome people mistakenly believe that tornadoes only occur in the countryside.  This is hardly the case.  While it is true that the [[Great Plains|plains states]] are tornado-prone, tornadoes have been reported in every U.S state, including [[Alaska]] and Hawaii.  One likely reason tornadoes are so common in the central U.S is because this is where Arctic air, cold fronts that have not been \"weakened\" yet first collide with warm tropical air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  As these fronts head further east, they sometimes lose their strength as they travel over more warm air.  For this reason, tornadoes are not as common on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] as they are in the Midwest.

For example, a freak tornado hit South St. Louis County Missouri on 31 December 2010, causing pockets of heavy damage to a modest area before dissipating. The temperature was unseasonably warm that day. They are least common during the winter and most common in spring. Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes in the late summer and fall can also be caused by hurricane landfall.\n\nNot every [[thunderstorm]], [[supercell]], [[squall|squall line]], or [[tropical cyclone]] will produce a tornado. Precisely the right atmospheric conditions are required for the formation of even a weak tornado. On the other hand, 700 or more tornadoes a year are reported in the contiguous United States.\n\nOn average, the United States experiences 100,000 thunderstorms each year, resulting in more than 1,200 tornadoes and approximately 50 deaths per year.  The deadliest U.S. tornado recorded is the 18 March 1925, [[Tri-State Tornado]] that swept across southeastern [[Missouri]], southern [[Illinois]] and southern [[Indiana]], killing 695 people. The biggest [[tornado outbreak]] on record\u2014with 353 tornadoes over the course of just 3 1/2 days, including four EF5 and eleven EF4 tornadoes\u2014occurred starting on 25 April 2011 and intensifying on 26 April and especially the record-breaking day of 27 April before ending on 28 April. It is referred to as the [[2011 Super Outbreak]]. Previously, the record was 148 tornadoes, dubbed the [[1974 Super Outbreak]].

Bluestein]] of the [[University of Oklahoma]], have referred to this phenomenon as \"five o'clock magic.\" Despite this, there are several morning tornadoes reported, like the [[Seymour, Texas|Seymour]], Texas one in April 1980.\n\n=== Seasonality ===\nThe time of year is a big factor of the intensity and frequency of tornadoes. On average, in the United States as a whole, the month with the most tornadoes is May, followed by the months June, April, and July. There is no \"tornado season\" though, as tornadoes, including violent tornadoes and major outbreaks, can and do occur anywhere at any time of year if favorable conditions develop. Major tornado outbreaks have occurred in every month of the year.\n\nJuly is the peak month in Austria, Finland, and Germany.<ref>Jenni Teittinen. [http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/115319.pdf A Climatology of Tornadoes in Finland.] Retrieved on 2006-10-25.</ref> On average, there are around 294 tornadoes throughout the United States during the month of May, and as many as 543 tornadoes have been reported in the month of May alone (in 2003). The months with the fewest tornadoes are usually December and January, although major tornado outbreaks can and sometimes do occur even in those months. In general, in the Midwestern and Plains states, springtime (especially the month of May) is the most active season for tornadoes, while in the far northern states (like [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]), the peak tornado season is usually in the summer months (June and July). In the colder late autumn and winter months (from early December to late February), tornado activity is generally limited to the southern states, where it is possible for warm Gulf of Mexico air to penetrate.\n\nThe reason for the peak period for tornado formation being in the spring has much to do with temperature patterns in the U.S. Tornadoes often form when cool, polar air traveling southeastward from the Rockies overrides warm, moist, unstable [[Gulf of Mexico]] air in the eastern states. Tornadoes therefore tend to be commonly found in front of a cold front, along with heavy rains, hail, and damaging winds.  Since both warm and cold weather are common during the springtime, the conflict between these two air masses tends to be most common in the spring. As the weather warms across the country, the occurrence of tornadoes spreads northward. Tornadoes are also common in the summer and early fall because they can also be triggered by hurricanes, although the tornadoes caused by hurricanes are often much weaker and harder to spot. Winter is the least common time for tornadoes to occur, since hurricane activity is virtually non-existent at this time, and it is more difficult for warm, moist maritime tropical air to take over the frigid Arctic air from Canada, occurrences are found mostly in the Gulf states and Florida during winter (although there have been some notable exceptions). There is a second active tornado season of the year, late October to mid-November. Autumn, like spring, is a time of the year when warm weather alternates with cold weather frequently, especially in the Midwest, but the season is not as active as it is during the springtime and tornado frequencies are higher along the Atlantic Coastal plain as opposed to the Midwest. They usually appear in late summer.\n\n== Long-term trends ==\n[[File:Tornado-counts-1976-2011.png|thumb|U. S.

Also, the 1980s seemed to be a period of unusually low tornado activity in the United States, and the number of multi-death tornadoes decreased every decade from the 1920s to the 1980s, suggesting a multi-decadal pattern of some sort.<ref>Grazulis, 196\u2013198</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tornado intensity and damage]]\n* [[Tornado records]]\n* [[List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]\n* [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes]]\n* [[List of tornadoes by calendar day]]\n* [[Tornadogenesis]]\n* [[Tornado myths]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Book references ===\n* {{Cite book | last = Grazulis | first = Thomas P | title = Significant Tornadoes 1680\u20131991 | date = July 1993 | publisher = The Tornado Project of Environmental Films | location = St. Johnsbury, VT | isbn = 978-1-879362-03-1 }}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite conference |first= Harold E. |last= Brooks |authorlink= Harold E.

He built schools and learning centers especially for children and monks. His aim is to educate the young generation of the society because he believes the futures lies in the hands of the youth. The cause of tyranny and conflicts in the society is due to education. People with improper education and no education could create problems in the society. They could do foolish thing because lack of literacy and education. Many of social conflicts are done by illiterate people since they can't read and think about the issue. So the most venerable U Pannya Jota aim is to build an educated society by providing secular and religious studies.\n<br>\nHe also hopes that children in his institutions will be examples and contributors to the society. In the documentary film he was interviewed about his works for the children and he said that he wants to provide education to poor children whose parents are not able to pay education fees to send their children to schools, and he mentioned some of these children are far from remote and hill areas of Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is not access to modern schools and facilities.These are some of his social institutions for children.\n\n* Sasana Vaddhana Pariyatti Kyaung (Religious school)\n* Be Happy Learning Centre (Orphanage & Free school)\n\n==The World Buddha Sasana Sevaka Sangha==\n\n{{Empty section|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Empty section|date=September 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Facebook|upannyajota.thera}}\n*Check in at [https://www.facebook.com/GoldenTempleBandarban Buddha Dhatu Jadi] and [https://www.facebook.com/RamaZadiBandarban/ Rama Zadi] on [[Facebook]]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkV0LMchRR89pgiYJ4x4-Qg/videos Dhamma Speech] by U Pannya Jota Mahathera on [[YouTube]]\n\n{{Theravada Buddhism}}\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n{{Religion topics}}\n\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Theravada Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:Buddhist religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Bangladeshi Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:20th-century Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:21st-century Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:Bangladeshi Buddhist scholars]]\n[[Category:Buddhist pacifists]]\n[[Category:Buddhist writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Buddhist monk}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=June 2019}}\n{{BLP sources|date=May 2019}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n\n{{Infobox religious biography\n| background         = \n|other_names         = Guru Bhante\n|image               = File:U_Pannya_Jota_Mahathera.jpg\n| caption            = {{abbr|Ven.|Venerable}} U Pannya Jota Mahathera in 2015\n| religion           = [[Buddhism]]\n| sect               = [[Theravada Buddhism]]\n| native_name        = \u1026\u1038\u1015\u100a\u102c\u1007\u1031\u102c\u1010\u1019\u101f\u102c\u1011\u1031\u101b\u103a\n\n \n\u0989 \u09aa\u099e\u09cd\u099e\u09be \u099c\u09cb\u09a4 \u09ae\u09b9\u09be\u09a5\u09c7\u09b0\n| native_name_lang   = bn\n| birth_name         = U Saw Hla\n| birth_date         = {{birth date      and age|1955|12|22}}\n|death_date = {{Death date and age|2020|04|13|1955|12|22}}\n| birth_place        = [[Bandarban District]]\n| nationality        = [[Bangladeshi]]\n| ethnicity          = [[Marma people|Marma]]\n| known_for          = Founder of [[Buddha Dhatu Jadi]], [[Rama Zadi]], [[The World Buddha Sasana Sevaka Sangha]], etc.\n| location           = Pannya Passanara Buddhist Monaster, Ujani Para, [[Bandarban]], [[Bangladesh]]\n| education          = [[L.L.B]], [[L.L.M]], [[B.C.S]]\n| occupation         = Ex.

He built schools and learning centers especially for children and monks. His aim is to educate the young generation of the society because he believes the futures lies in the hands of the youth. The cause of tyranny and conflicts in the society is due to education. People with improper education and no education could create problems in the society. They could do foolish thing because lack of literacy and education. Many of social conflicts are done by illiterate people since they can't read and think about the issue. So the most venerable U Pannya Jota aim is to build an educated society by providing secular and religious studies.\n<br>\nHe also hopes that children in his institutions will be examples and contributors to the society. In the documentary film he was interviewed about his works for the children and he said that he wants to provide education to poor children whose parents are not able to pay education fees to send their children to schools, and he mentioned some of these children are far from remote and hill areas of Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is not access to modern schools and facilities.These are some of his social institutions for children.\n\n* Sasana Vaddhana Pariyatti Kyaung (Religious school)\n* Be Happy Learning Centre (Orphanage & Free school)\n\n==The World Buddha Sasana Sevaka Sangha==\n\n{{Empty section|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Empty section|date=September 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Facebook|upannyajota.thera}}\n*Check in at [https://www.facebook.com/GoldenTempleBandarban Buddha Dhatu Jadi] and [https://www.facebook.com/RamaZadiBandarban/ Rama Zadi] on [[Facebook]]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkV0LMchRR89pgiYJ4x4-Qg/videos Dhamma Speech] by U Pannya Jota Mahathera on [[YouTube]]\n\n{{Theravada Buddhism}}\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n{{Religion topics}}\n\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Theravada Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:Buddhist religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Bangladeshi Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:20th-century Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:21st-century Buddhist monks]]\n[[Category:Bangladeshi Buddhist scholars]]\n[[Category:Buddhist pacifists]]\n[[Category:Buddhist writers]]\n", "name_user": "Falucidate", "label": "safe", "comment": "Missing commas added.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Pannya_Jota_Mahathera"}

After three nights, \"owing to the shaft of malevolence\", this comedy was withdrawn, and was never printed.  In 1795 Brewer wrote ''The Motto, or the History of Bill Woodcock''; and he wrote ''Bannian Day'', a musical entertainment in two acts, which was published and performed at the Haymarket in the same year for seven or eight nights, though but \"a poor piece\".
