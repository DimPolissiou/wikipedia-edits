Familiar examples might include [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lilies]], [[Frog|frogs]], [[Turtle|turtles]], and [[Heron|herons]]. Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by [[wetland]], and these wetlands support the aquatic [[food web]], provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. Some grazing animals like [[Goose|geese]] and [[Muskrat|muskrats]] consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food.  In many other cases, however, the pond plants fall into the water and [[Decomposition|decay]]. Many invertebrates then feed on the decaying plants, and these invertebrates provide food for wetland species including fish, [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]], and herons. The open water may allow [[algae]] to grow, and these algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and [[Minnow|minnows]]. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae. Hence, ponds often have many different animal species using the wide array of food sources. They, therefore, provide an important source of [[biological diversity]] in landscapes.\n\n[[Vernal pond]]s are ponds which dry up for part of the year. They are so called because they are typically at their peak depth in the spring (the meaning of \"vernal\" comes form the Latin word for [[Spring (season)|spring]]). Naturally occurring vernal ponds do not usually have fish.  The absence of fish is a very important characteristic since it provides amphibians with breeding locations free from [[predation]] by fish. Hence, introducing fish to a pond can have seriously detrimental consequences. In some parts of the world, such as California, the vernal ponds have rare and endangered plant species. On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the [[Mississippi Gopher Frog]].<ref name=keddy />\n\n==Conservation and management==\n[[File:Niagara Falls Garden 2005.JPG|thumb|left|Formal [[rock garden]] pond with [[waterfall]]]]\nPonds, being small, are easily disrupted by human activity, such as hikers. Drainage of ponds is a frequent problem in agricultural areas, such as in the prairie potholes of North America. Although ponds are a useful source of water for cattle, [[overgrazing]] and wading can turn a pond into a muddy hole.  Nutrient sources such as fertilized pastures, human sewage, and even lawn [[fertilizer]] can cause explosive growth of algae and the loss of rooted plants and many other aquatic species.  Roads near ponds can kill large numbers of amphibians and turtles that may migrate to and from the pond as part of their annual breeding cycle. Many well-intentioned people introduce fish to ponds, being unaware that some species may eat aquatic plants, stir up sediment, and eat the young of amphibians and many other invertebrate species. The gentle slope of land into ponds also provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows.  The construction of retaining walls, or lawns, can severely degrade the life in a pond.\n\nIn landscapes where ponds are artificially constructed, they are done so to provide wildlife viewing opportunities, to treat wastewater, or for aesthetic purposes, such as part of a golf course. The design of a pond determines how productive it will be for wildlife.  In general, gently sloping shorelines with broad expanses of wetland plants not only provide the best conditions for wildlife, but they help protect water quality from sources in the surrounding landscapes. It is also beneficial to allow water levels to fall each year during drier periods. Roads and houses should be kept as far away as possible.<ref>{{cite book |author=Canadian Wildlife Service |title=How Much Habitat is Enough? A Framework for Guiding Habitat Rehabilitation in Great Lakes Areas of Concern |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Canadian Wildlife Service |isbn=978-0662265771 }}</ref>\n\nAnother important way to add ponds back into landscapes is to restore rivers so that they can flood and meander to create large numbers of natural ponds, including vernal pools and wetlands, in river valleys.<ref>{{cite book |author=K.

In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian; as [[stew pond]]s, [[mill pond]]s and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds.  Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \"stock pond\", used for watering livestock.\n\n''Pond'' usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.\n\nSome regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than {{convert|10|acre|ha}}.  [[Minnesota]], known as the 'land of 10,000 lakes' is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/faq/mnfacts/water.html |title=Lakes, rivers, and wetlands facts |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakes/faqs.html#lake_definition |title=Frequently asked questions about lakes |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter December 2007 with Pond.jpg|thumb|Pond in winter]]\n\nThe term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from [[surface runoff]] (''ponded'' water).\n\nThere are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is [[loch]]an, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed [[Dry lake|playas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Loren M. Smith |title=Playas of the Great Plains |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292743687 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPonds are used for the provision of fish and other wildlife including [[waterfowl]], which is a source of food for humans.  [[Pollution|Pollutants]] entering ponds are often substantially mitigated by the natural [[sedimentation]] and biological activities within the water body. Ponds are also a major contributor to local [[ecosystem]] richness and diversity for both plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/infd-8agmdg|title=Freshwater ecosystems:publisher=Forest Research|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Hindu]] temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take [[Bathing#Purpose|baths]]. These ponds are considered sacred.\n\nIn [[medieval]] times in [[Europe]], it was typical for many [[monastery]] and [[castle]]s (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have [[fish pond]]s. These are still common in Europe and in [[East Asia]] (notably Japan), where [[koi]] may be kept.\n\n[[Stabilization pond|Waste stabilization ponds]] are used as a low-cost method for [[wastewater treatment]].\n\nIn agriculture, [[Treatment pond|treatment ponds]] may reduce nutrients released downstream from the pond. They may also provide [[irrigation]] [[reservoir]]s at times of drought.\n\n[[File:Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Quito, cool stone bridge.

On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the [[Mississippi Gopher Frog]].<ref name=keddy />\n\n==Conservation and management==\n[[File:Niagara Falls Garden 2005.JPG|thumb|left|Formal [[rock garden]] pond with [[waterfall]]]]\nPonds, being small, are easily disrupted by human activity, such as hikers. Drainage of ponds is a frequent problem in agricultural areas, such as in the prairie potholes of North America. Although ponds are a useful source of water for cattle, [[overgrazing]] and wading can turn a pond into a muddy hole.  Nutrient sources such as fertilized pastures, human sewage, and even lawn [[fertilizer]] can cause explosive growth of algae and the loss of rooted plants and many other aquatic species.  Roads near ponds can kill large numbers of amphibians and turtles that may migrate to and from the pond as part of their annual breeding cycle. Many well-intentioned people introduce fish to ponds, being unaware that some species may eat aquatic plants, stir up sediment, and eat the young of amphibians and many other invertebrate species. The gentle slope of land into ponds also provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows.  The construction of retaining walls, or lawns, can severely degrade the life in a pond.\n\nIn landscapes where ponds are artificially constructed, they are done so to provide wildlife viewing opportunities, to treat wastewater, or for aesthetic purposes, such as part of a golf course. The design of a pond determines how productive it will be for wildlife.  In general, gently sloping shorelines with broad expanses of wetland plants not only provide the best conditions for wildlife, but they help protect water quality from sources in the surrounding landscapes. It is also beneficial to allow water levels to fall each year during drier periods. Roads and houses should be kept as far away as possible.<ref>{{cite book |author=Canadian Wildlife Service |title=How Much Habitat is Enough? A Framework for Guiding Habitat Rehabilitation in Great Lakes Areas of Concern |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Canadian Wildlife Service |isbn=978-0662265771 }}</ref>\n\nAnother important way to add ponds back into landscapes is to restore rivers so that they can flood and meander to create large numbers of natural ponds, including vernal pools and wetlands, in river valleys.<ref>{{cite book |author=K. S. Richards |title=The Flooded Forest: Guidance for Policy Makers and River Managers in Europe on the Restoration of Floodplain Forests |year=2003 |publisher=FLOBAR2 Project |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Staw naturalny.JPG|thumb|left|A pond in [[Swarzynice]], [[Poland]]]]\n\nIn origin, a pond is a variant form of the word pound, meaning a confining enclosure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pond |title=Pond |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> As straying cattle are enclosed in a pound so water is enclosed in a pond. In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian; as [[stew pond]]s, [[mill pond]]s and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds.  Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \"stock pond\", used for watering livestock.\n\n''Pond'' usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.\n\nSome regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than {{convert|10|acre|ha}}.  [[Minnesota]], known as the 'land of 10,000 lakes' is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/faq/mnfacts/water.html |title=Lakes, rivers, and wetlands facts |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakes/faqs.html#lake_definition |title=Frequently asked questions about lakes |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter December 2007 with Pond.jpg|thumb|Pond in winter]]\n\nThe term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from [[surface runoff]] (''ponded'' water).\n\nThere are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is [[loch]]an, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed [[Dry lake|playas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Loren M. Smith |title=Playas of the Great Plains |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292743687 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPonds are used for the provision of fish and other wildlife including [[waterfowl]], which is a source of food for humans.  [[Pollution|Pollutants]] entering ponds are often substantially mitigated by the natural [[sedimentation]] and biological activities within the water body. Ponds are also a major contributor to local [[ecosystem]] richness and diversity for both plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/infd-8agmdg|title=Freshwater ecosystems:publisher=Forest Research|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Hindu]] temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take [[Bathing#Purpose|baths]]. These ponds are considered sacred.\n\nIn [[medieval]] times in [[Europe]], it was typical for many [[monastery]] and [[castle]]s (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have [[fish pond]]s. These are still common in Europe and in [[East Asia]] (notably Japan), where [[koi]] may be kept.\n\n[[Stabilization pond|Waste stabilization ponds]] are used as a low-cost method for [[wastewater treatment]].\n\nIn agriculture, [[Treatment pond|treatment ponds]] may reduce nutrients released downstream from the pond. They may also provide [[irrigation]] [[reservoir]]s at times of drought.\n\n[[File:Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Quito, cool stone bridge.

The programme originated from a one-off drama, ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'', broadcast in August 1983.\n\nThe programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of [[police officer]]s, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. ''The Bill'' was the longest-running [[police procedural]] television series in the [[United Kingdom]], and among the longest running of any British television series at the time of its cancellation. The title originates from \"Old Bill\", a [[List of police-related slang terms|slang term for the police]].\n\nAlthough highly acclaimed by fans and critics, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]]. The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a [[watershed (television)|pre-watershed]] slot. ''The Bill'' won [[List of Awards of The Bill|several awards]], including [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s, a [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] award, and Best Drama at the [[Inside Soap Awards#2009|Inside Soap Awards]] in 2009, this being the series' fourth consecutive win.\n\nThroughout its 26-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on [[ITV3]] on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]], [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]], and [[Drama (British TV channel)|Drama]]. In March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission ''The Bill'' and that recording on the series would cease on 14 June 2010. The last episode aired on 31 August 2010.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of The Bill}}\n\n''The Bill'' was originally conceived by [[Geoff McQueen]] in 1983, then a new television writer, as a one-off [[Dramatic programming|drama]]. McQueen had originally titled the production ''Old Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> It was picked up by Michael Chapman for [[History of ITV#1968\u20131974|ITV franchise]] holder [[Thames Television]], who retitled it ''Woodentop'' as part of Thames's \"Storyboard\" series of one-off dramas and was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] under the title ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'' on 16 August 1983.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> ''Woodentop'' starred [[Mark Wingett]] as [[Constable|PC]] [[Jim Carver]] and [[Trudie Goodwin]] as WPC [[June Ackland]] of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], both attached to the fictional [[Sun Hill police station]].<ref name=\"Tibballs\">{{cite book|last=Tibballs|first=Geoff|title=The Bill: The Official History of Sun Hill|publisher=Carlton|date=November 2003|page=10|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-1-84442-667-6}}</ref>\n\nAlthough originally only intended as a one-off, ''Woodentop'' impressed ITV to the extent that a full series was commissioned, first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one [[Watershed (television)|post-watershed]] episode per week, featuring an hour-long, separate storyline for each episode of the first three series. The first episode of the full series was \"Funny Ol' Business \u2013 Cops & Robbers\". With serialisation, the name of the show changed from ''Woodentop'' to ''The Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> Series one had 11 episodes and was broadcast in 1984, series two and three had 12 episodes each and were broadcast in 1985-6 and 1987 respectively. With a full ensemble cast to explore new characters not featured or just mentioned in ''Woodentop'', the focus of the storylines soon shifted away from new recruit Carver and towards [[Detective Inspector]] Roy Galloway and Sergeant Bob Cryer.\n\nThe series then changed to two episodes, each of 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being broadcast all year round without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, ''The Bill'' returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly,<ref name=\"BBC2003\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|title=The Bill prepares for live birthday|date=30 October 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818091509/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|archivedate=18 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the Friday episode being dropped, at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach.

Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the [[Golden Opportunity (The Bill)|Sun Hill fire]] during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce \"plausible, powerful new characters\". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, but, as Marquess put it, the viewers still \"don't go home with them\".<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The change also allowed ''The Bill'' to become more reflective of modern policing, with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, [[Adam Okaro]]. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant [[Craig Gilmore (The Bill)|Craig Gilmore]] and PC [[Luke Ashton]], a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival ''[[Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/>\n\nIn 2005, [[Johnathan Young]] took over as executive producer.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The serial format was dropped and ''The Bill'' returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers. 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles, which had been dropped in 2002.<ref name=\"changing times\"/> In 2009, ''The Bill'' moved back to the 9pm slot it previously held, and the theme tune, \"Overkill\", was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series.<ref

''not'' change \"is\" to \"was\" it has not stopped being a police procedural just because it is no longer made.--> a British [[police procedural]] television series, first broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 16 August 1983 until 31 August 2010. The programme originated from a one-off drama, ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'', broadcast in August 1983.\n\nThe programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of [[police officer]]s, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. ''The Bill'' was the longest-running [[police procedural]] television series in the [[United Kingdom]], and among the longest running of any British television series at the time of its cancellation. The title originates from \"Old Bill\", a [[List of police-related slang terms|slang term for the police]].\n\nAlthough highly acclaimed by fans and critics, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]]. The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a [[watershed (television)|pre-watershed]] slot. ''The Bill'' won [[List of Awards of The Bill|several awards]], including [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s, a [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] award, and Best Drama at the [[Inside Soap Awards#2009|Inside Soap Awards]] in 2009, this being the series' fourth consecutive win.\n\nThroughout its 26-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on [[ITV3]] on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]], [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]], and [[Drama (British TV channel)|Drama]]. In March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission ''The Bill'' and that recording on the series would cease on 14 June 2010. The last episode aired on 31 August 2010.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of The Bill}}\n\n''The Bill'' was originally conceived by [[Geoff McQueen]] in 1983, then a new television writer, as a one-off [[Dramatic programming|drama]]. McQueen had originally titled the production ''Old Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> It was picked up by Michael Chapman for [[History of ITV#1968\u20131974|ITV franchise]] holder [[Thames Television]], who retitled it ''Woodentop'' as part of Thames's \"Storyboard\" series of one-off dramas and was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] under the title ''[[Woodentop (The Bill)|Woodentop]]'' on 16 August 1983.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> ''Woodentop'' starred [[Mark Wingett]] as [[Constable|PC]] [[Jim Carver]] and [[Trudie Goodwin]] as WPC [[June Ackland]] of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], both attached to the fictional [[Sun Hill police station]].<ref name=\"Tibballs\">{{cite book|last=Tibballs|first=Geoff|title=The Bill: The Official History of Sun Hill|publisher=Carlton|date=November 2003|page=10|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-1-84442-667-6}}</ref>\n\nAlthough originally only intended as a one-off, ''Woodentop'' impressed ITV to the extent that a full series was commissioned, first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one [[Watershed (television)|post-watershed]] episode per week, featuring an hour-long, separate storyline for each episode of the first three series. The first episode of the full series was \"Funny Ol' Business \u2013 Cops & Robbers\". With serialisation, the name of the show changed from ''Woodentop'' to ''The Bill''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> Series one had 11 episodes and was broadcast in 1984, series two and three had 12 episodes each and were broadcast in 1985-6 and 1987 respectively. With a full ensemble cast to explore new characters not featured or just mentioned in ''Woodentop'', the focus of the storylines soon shifted away from new recruit Carver and towards [[Detective Inspector]] Roy Galloway and Sergeant Bob Cryer.\n\nThe series then changed to two episodes, each of 30 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being broadcast all year round without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, ''The Bill'' returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly,<ref name=\"BBC2003\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|title=The Bill prepares for live birthday|date=30 October 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818091509/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3227753.stm|archivedate=18 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> with the Friday episode being dropped, at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach.

Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the [[Golden Opportunity (The Bill)|Sun Hill fire]] during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce \"plausible, powerful new characters\". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, but, as Marquess put it, the viewers still \"don't go home with them\".<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The change also allowed ''The Bill'' to become more reflective of modern policing, with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, [[Adam Okaro]]. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant [[Craig Gilmore (The Bill)|Craig Gilmore]] and PC [[Luke Ashton]], a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival ''[[Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]''.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/>\n\nIn 2005, [[Johnathan Young]] took over as executive producer.<ref name=\"Tibballs\"/> The serial format was dropped and ''The Bill'' returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers. 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles, which had been dropped in 2002.<ref name=\"changing times\"/> In 2009, ''The Bill'' moved back to the 9pm slot it previously held, and the theme tune, \"Overkill\", was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series.<ref

This sequence kept the first version of \"Overkill\", and also used the same ending credits from series one.

Minor changes to the sequence included the Rover SD1 changing into a [[Ford Sierra]] in 1993, which was replaced by a [[Vauxhall Vectra]] in 1997. In the 1997 sequence, the Vectra was seen overtaking a [[Leyland Titan (B15)|Leyland Titan]] bus, before screeching to a halt, and the main sequence starting.

The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity.\n\nThe Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in October 1936. [[Benito Mussolini]] declared on 1 November 1936 that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome\u2013Berlin axis, thus creating the term \"Axis\".<ref name=\"Schmitz\">{{cite book |author=Cornelia Schmitz-Berning |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=745 |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-11-019549-1 }}<!--|accessdate=26 March 2015 --></ref><ref name=\"GlobSec\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/axis.htm |title=Axis |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}</ref> The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anti-communist treaty between Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Italy joined the Pact in 1937. The \"Rome\u2013Berlin Axis\" became a [[Collective defense|military alliance]] in 1939 under the so-called \"[[Pact of Steel]]\", with the [[Tripartite Pact]] of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nAt its zenith during World War II, the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[East Asia]]. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with slightly more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Origins and creation==\n{{Fascism sidebar}}\n{{Main|Tripartite Pact}}\nThe term \"axis\" was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's ''Germania Repubblica'' that \"there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin\" (''non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino'').<ref>Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and G\u00fcnter Holtus, eds., ''Genesi e dimensioni di un vocabolario etimologico'', Lessico Etimologico Italiano: Etymologie und Wortgeschichte des Italienischen (Ludwig Reichert, 1992), p. 63.</ref> At the time, he was seeking an alliance with the [[Weimar Republic]] against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in the dispute over the [[Free State of Fiume]].<ref name=Watt>D.

When Mussolini publicly announced the signing on 1 November, he proclaimed the creation of a Rome\u2013Berlin axis.<ref name=Watt/>\n\n===Initial proposals of a German\u2013Italian alliance===\nItaly under ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] had pursued a strategic alliance of Italy with Germany against France since the early 1920s.<ref name=\"MacGregor Knox 2000.

The German ambassador to Italy in 1924 reported that Mussolini saw a nationalist Germany as an essential ally for Italy against France, and hoped to tap into the desire within the German army and the German political right for a war of revenge against France.<ref name=\"MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124\"/>\n\nDuring the Weimar Republic, the German government did not respect the Treaty of Versailles that it had been pressured to sign, and various government figures at the time rejected Germany's post-Versailles borders. General [[Hans von Seeckt]] (head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' command from 1920 to 1926) supported an alliance between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] to invade and partition Poland between them and restore the German-Russian border of 1914.<ref name=\"Christian Leitz p10\">Christian Leitz.

Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 125.</ref>\n\nMeetings took place in Berlin in 1924 between Italian General [[Luigi Capello]] and prominent figures in the German military, such as von Seeckt and [[Erich Ludendorff]], over military collaboration between Germany and Italy. The discussions concluded that Germans still wanted a war of revenge against France but were short on weapons and hoped that Italy could assist Germany.<ref>John Gooch.

Pp. 124\"/> Italian foreign minister [[Dino Grandi]] in the early 1930s stressed the importance of \"decisive weight\", involving Italy's relations between France and Germany, in which he recognized that Italy was not yet a major power, but perceived that Italy did have strong enough influence to alter the political situation in Europe by placing the weight of its support onto one side or another.<ref>Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995.

Germany needed access to the territory held by Yugoslavia to allow German forces to have a direct route to travel through, to reach and rescue Italian military forces that were faltering in their campaign in Greece. There was substantial animosity towards the alliance amongst Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group, who had fought German Austrians and Germany on the side of the Allies in World War I, and three Serb cabinet ministers resigned their positions in protest after the alliance was signed. Hitler initially attempted to be conciliatory to the Serbs who held animosity to the agreement, saying that he \"understood the feelings\" of those Serbs who opposed the alliance. Amidst the negotiations, Hitler expressed concern to Italian foreign minister Ciano that he sensed trouble coming in Belgrade. A coup d'\u00e9tat occurred in Yugoslavia in which a government rose to power and abandoned its association with the Axis. Hitler accused the coup of being engineered by the British. The coup was at least partly supported by the British though there was substantial patriotic enthusiasm against the Pact with rallies in Belgrade. At the rallies in Belgrade immediately after the coup, people were heard to be shouting \"Better war than pact!\" and waving British, American, and French flags. Days after the coup d'\u00e9tat, Hitler ordered the German General Staff to plan for an invasion of Yugoslavia.<ref>John Lukacs. The Last European War: September 1939 - December 1941.

Hitler in his early years as Nazi leader had claimed that he would be willing to accept friendly relations with Russia on the tactical condition that Russia agree to return to the borders established by the German\u2013Russian peace agreement of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] signed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] in 1918 which gave large territories held by Russia to German control in exchange for peace.<ref name=\"Peter D.

The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation during the early 1920s]]. In 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupied the Ruhr region]] when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the [[Great Depression]] created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist [[stab-in-the-back legend]] stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] that would include [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland]], and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]], and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") in eastern Europe.\n\nGermany renounced the Versailles treaty and [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the Rhineland]] in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force, the [[Luftwaffe]], and naval force, the [[Kriegsmarine]] in 1935. Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudetenland]] from Czechoslovakia, and the [[Memel territory]] from [[Lithuania]] in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939, creating the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the country of [[Slovakia]].\n\nOn 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and [[Wehrmacht|its military forces]] were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied [[Normandy Landings|landings in France]] and [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Italy]], led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.\n\nThere was substantial internal opposition within the German military to the Nazi regime's aggressive strategy of rearmament and foreign policy in the 1930s.<ref>Command Magagzine. Hitler's Army: The Evolution and Structure of German Forces 1933\u20131945.

Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia declared its independence. The new [[Slovak State]] allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nThe [[General Government]] was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nBelgium quickly surrendered to Germany, and the Belgian King remained in the country during the German military occupation from 1940 to 1944. The Belgian King cooperated closely with Germany and repeatedly sought assurances that Belgian rights would be retained once Germany achieved total victory. However, Hitler intended to annex Belgium and its Germanic population into the Greater Germanic Reich, initiated by the creation of [[Reichskommissariat Belgien]], an authority run directly by the German government that sought the incorporation of the territory into the planned Germanic Reich. However Belgium was soon occupied by Allied forces in 1944.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Niederlande]] was an occupation authority and territory established in the Netherlands in 1940 designated as a colony to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]] was established in Norway in 1940. Like the Reichskommissariats in Belgium and the Netherlands, its Germanic peoples were to be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich. In Norway, the [[Quisling regime]], headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]], was installed by the Germans as a client regime [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|during the occupation]], while king [[Haakon VII]] and the legal [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government were in exile]]. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|in the Waffen-SS]], collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].\n\nAbout 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where [[resistance during World War II]] was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Quisling and other collaborators were executed]]. Quisling's name has become an international [[eponym]] for [[traitor]].\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] was established in the Baltic region in 1941. Unlike the western Reichskommissariats that sought the incorporation of their majority Germanic peoples, Ostland were designed for settlement by Germans who would displace the non-Germanic majority living there, as part of ''lebensraum''.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was established in Ukraine in 1941. Like Ostland it was slated for settlement by Germans.\n\nThe [[Military Administration in Serbia]] was established on occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] territory in April 1941, following the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the country]]. On 30 April a pro-German Serbian administration was formed under [[Milan A\u0107imovi\u0107]] to serve as a civil administration in the military occupation zone. A joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] and [[Chetnik]] uprising in late 1941 became a serious concern for the Germans, as most of their forces were deployed to Russia; only three divisions were in the country. On 13 August 546 Serbs, including some of the country's prominent and influential leaders, issued an appeal to the Serbian nation that condemned the Partisan and royalist resistance as unpatriotic. Two weeks after the appeal, with the Partisan and royalist insurgency beginning to gain momentum, 75 prominent Serbs convened a meeting in Belgrade and formed a [[Government of National Salvation]] under Serbian General [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] to replace the existing Serbian administration. The Germans were short of police and military forces in Serbia, and came to rely on poorly armed Serbian formations, the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], to maintain order. These forces, however, were not able to contain the resistance, and for the most of the war large parts of Serbia were under control of the Partisans or Chetniks (the two resistance movements soon became mutually-hostile). The Government of National Salvation, imbued with few powers upon formation, saw its functions further decreased and taken over by the [[Wehrmacht]] occupation authorities as the war progressed. After the initial mass revolts, the German authorities instituted an extreme regime of reprisals, proclaiming that 100 civilians would be executed for every German soldier killed, and 50 for each one wounded. These measures were actually implemented on more than one occasion: large-scale shootings took place in the Serbian towns of [[Kraljevo massacre|Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]] during October 1941.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian Empire|IItalian imperial ism under fascism|Latin Bloc (proposed alliance)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-09, Nordafrika, italienische Soldaten auf dem Marsch.jpg|thumb|Italian soldiers in the [[North African Campaign]] in 1941]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-38, Nordafrika, italienische Panzer M13-40.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Fiat M13/40]] tanks in the North African Campaign in 1941]]\n[[File:Veneto guns at Gaudos.jpg|thumb|Italian battleship ''[[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]'' firing at Allied warships during the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016230-0008, Bersaglieri in Jugoslawien.jpg|thumb|Italian ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]]]]\n[[File:Macchi200 m2.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Macchi C.200]] fighter aircraft during the war]]\n\n====War justifications====\n\n''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: \"We are going to war against the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] and [[reactionary]] [[Democracy|democracies]] of the [[Western world|West]] who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the [[Italians|Italian people]]\".<ref>John Whittam.

There was a desire to annex [[Dalmatia]]n territories, which had formerly been ruled by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and which consequently had Italian-speaking elites. The intention of the Fascist regime was to create a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\" in which Italy would dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In 1935\u20131936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia]] and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the \"Italian Empire\".{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=289}} Protests by the [[League of Nations]], especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed [[Albania]]. Germany and Italy signed the [[Pact of Steel]] on May 22.\n\nItaly entered World War II on 10 June 1940. In September 1940 Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]].\n\nItaly was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935\u20131936 and then in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40\u201341}} \nMussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.<ref>[[Samuel W.

Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'' (2001) ch 13</ref>\n\nAt its peak, Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] included [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], large parts of [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[The Philippines]], [[Burma]], a small part of India, and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific.\n\nAs a result of the internal discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the [[League of Nations]] and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan entered into conflict [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against the Chinese]] in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the [[Nanking massacre]] and the [[Three Alls Policy]].

In 1940 Japan responded to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] by occupying [[French Indochina]]. The [[Vichy France]] regime, a ''de facto'' ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.\n\nTo isolate the US forces stationed in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and to reduce US naval power, the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] ordered [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|an attack]] on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|engaged Japanese forces]] in Manchuria and northeast China.\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische jongens tijdens hun soldatentraining door de Japanners TMnr 10001989.jpg|thumb|Japanese officers training Indonesian recruits]]\nTaiwan, then known as Formosa, was a Japanese dependency established in 1895.\n\nKorea was a Japanese protectorate and dependency formally established by the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910]].\n\nThe [[South Pacific Mandate]] were territories granted to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements of World War I, that designated to Japan the German South Pacific islands. Japan received these as a reward by the Allies of World War I, when Japan was then allied against Germany.\n\nJapan occupied the [[Dutch East Indies]] during the war. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of [[Indonesia]] and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President [[Sukarno]], however these efforts did not deliver the creation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.<ref>Li Narangoa, R. B. Cribb. ''Imperial Japan and National Identities in Asia, 1895-1945''. Psychology Press, 2003. P15-16.</ref>\n\n==Subsequent signatories of the Tripartite Pact==\nIn addition to the 3 major Axis powers, 4 more countries and 2 puppet regimes signed the Tri-Partite Pact as its member states. Of the 4 countries, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the 4th, Yugoslavia, saw its pro-Nazi government overthrown in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.\n\nThe 2 puppet regimes that signed the Tri-Partite Pact, Tiso-led Slovakia and the Independent State of Croatia are listed among the client states section below.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army 1941.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the Balkans campaign]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was ruled by [[Boris III of Bulgaria|\u0422sar Boris III]] when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]] (all within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] and [[Turkey]]). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the [[Treaty of Craiova]], returning to Bulgaria the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]], which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria \u2014 if it joined the Axis \u2014 an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].\n\nBulgaria participated in the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries\u2014southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia ([[Vardar Banovina]]) and north-eastern Greece (parts of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Greek Thrace]]). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and [[resistance movement]]s. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The [[Bulgarian Navy]] was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping.\n\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]] and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943\u20131944.\n\nOn 2 September 1944, as the [[Red Army]] approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 September 1944]], which brought a government of the pro-Soviet [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{Main|Hungary during World War II|Government of National Unity (Hungary)}}\n[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank as used during the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]][[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], ruled by [[Regent]] Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940. Slovakia had been a client state of Germany since 1939.<ref>Seamus Dunn, T.G. Fraser. Europe and Ethnicity: The First World War and Contemporary Ethnic Conflict. Routledge, 1996. P97.</ref>\n\nPolitical instability plagued the country until Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian naval]] officer, became regent in 1920. The vast majority of the Hungarians desired to recover territories lost through the [[Trianon Treaty]]. The country drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I.{{sfn|Montgomery|2002|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Many people sympathized with the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] policy of the Nazi regime. Due to its supportive stance towards Germany and the new efforts in the international policy, Hungary gained favourable territorial settlements by the [[First Vienna Award]], after the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] occupied and annexed the remainder of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and in 1940 received [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania via the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and Hungarian forces took part in the invasion. Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.\n\nAlthough Hungary did not initially participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hungary and the [[Soviet Union]] became belligerents on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the [[Hungarian Second Army]].[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1944]]\n\nOn 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the revived Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the [[Voronezh Front]], on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. In 1944, with Soviet troops advancing toward Hungary, Horthy attempted to reach an armistice with the Allies. However, the Germans [[Operation Panzerfaust|replaced the existing regime with a new one]]. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.\n[[File:Rep\u00fcl\u0151t\u00e9r, 1944. \u00e1prilis 13.

Horthy was forced to abdicate after German commandos, led by Colonel [[Otto Skorzeny]], held his son hostage as part of [[Operation Panzerfaust]].\n\nHungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian fascist regime called the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]], led by [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]]. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the anti-Semitic fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. In power, his government was a puppet regime with little authority, and the country was effectively under German control. Days after the Sz\u00e1lasi government took power, the capital of [[Budapest]] was surrounded by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. German and Hungarian fascist forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. In March 1945, Sz\u00e1lasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.\n\n===Romania===\n{{Main|Romania in World War II|Romanian Navy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B03212, M\u00fcnchen, Staatsbesuch Jon Antonescu bei Hitler.jpg|thumb|Ion Antonescu and [[Adolf Hitler]] at the ''[[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen|F\u00fchrerbau]]'' in [[Munich]] (June 1941)]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-218-0501-27, Russland-S\u00fcd, rum\u00e4nische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|right|Romanian soldiers on the outskirts of Stalingrad during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942]]\n[[File:IAR80.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of Romanian [[IAR80]] fighter aircraft]]\n\nWhen war erupted in Europe in 1939, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] was pro-British and allied to the [[Polish-Romanian alliance|Poles]].

[[Southern Dobruja]] was ceded to [[Bulgaria]] in September 1940. In an effort to appease the Fascist elements within the country and obtain German protection, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] appointed the General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister on September 6, 1940.\n\nTwo days later, Antonescu forced the king to abdicate and installed the king's young son [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai) on the throne, then declared himself ''Conduc\u0103tor'' (\"Leader\") with dictatorial powers. The [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed on 14 September, with the [[Iron Guard]] ruling together with Antonescu as the sole legal political movement in Romania. Under King Michael I and the military government of Antonescu, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] on November 23, 1940. German troops entered the country on 10 October 1941, officially to train the Romanian Army. Hitler's directive to the troops on 10 October had stated that \"it is necessary to avoid even the slightest semblance of military occupation of Romania\".<ref>Dinu C.

From late 1940 Hitler sought a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact, the Yugoslav delayed.  In March, divisions of the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border and permission was sought for them to pass through to attack Greece. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that \"Yugoslavia has found its soul\"; however, Hitler invaded and quickly took control.\n\n==Co-belligerent state combatants==\nVarious countries fought side by side with the Axis powers for a common cause. These countries were not signatories of the Tripartite Pact and thus not formal members of the Axis.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Military history of Finland during World War II}}\n\nAlthough Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact and legally ''(de jure)'' was not a part of the Axis, it was Axis-aligned in its fight against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=134}} Finland signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1941.<ref>Kent Forster, \"Finland's Foreign Policy 1940-1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,\" ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp 109-123</ref>\n\nThe August 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}}{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=120}} After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in November 1939 during the [[Winter War]], intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|pp=120\u2013121}}{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The conflict threatened Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=123}} Despite Finnish resistance, a peace treaty was signed in March 1940, wherein Finland ceded some key territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]]. After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom{{sfn|Seppinen|1983|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}<ref name=\"FOFinland\">British Foreign Office Archive, 371/24809/461-556.</ref> and non-aligned Sweden,{{sfn|Jokipii|1987|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.\n\nIn the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over [[Kronstadt]] and [[Neva River]] to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in [[East Prussia]]. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish airfields and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the [[Continuation War]].\n\n[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb| [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] with Hitler]]\nFinland's main objective was to regain territory lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War. However, on 10 July 1941, Field Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] issued an [[Order of the Day]] that contained a formulation understood internationally as a Finnish territorial interest in Russian [[Karelia]].\n\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Finland were severed on 1 August 1941, after the British bombed German forces in the Finnish village and port of [[Pechenga (urban-type settlement), Murmansk Oblast|Petsamo]]. The United Kingdom repeatedly called on Finland to cease its offensive against the Soviet Union, and declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]].\n[[File:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish troops passing by the remains of a destroyed Soviet T-34 at the [[battle of Tali-Ihantala]]]]\nFinland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk. Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.\n\nThe relationship between Finland and Germany more closely resembled an alliance during the six weeks of the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the [[Fourth strategic offensive|Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day]] threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement, signed by President [[Risto Ryti]] but never ratified by the Finnish Parliament, bound Finland not to seek a separate peace.\n\nAfter Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in a ceasefire on 4 September and the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]].

Iraqi military resistance ended by 31 May 1941. Rashid Ali and the Mufti of Jerusalem fled to Iran, then Turkey, Italy, and finally Germany, where Ali was welcomed by Hitler as head of the Iraqi [[government-in-exile]] in Berlin. In propaganda broadcasts from Berlin, the Mufti continued to call on Arabs to rise up against the British and aid German and Italian forces.

Only hours after the invasion, Prime Minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] ordered the cessation of resistance against the Japanese. On 21 December 1941, a military alliance with Japan was signed and on 25 January 1942, [[Sang Phathanothai]] read over the radio Thailand's formal declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thai ambassador to the United States, [[Mom Rajawongse]] [[Seni Pramoj]], did not deliver his copy of the declaration of war. Therefore, although the British reciprocated by declaring war on Thailand and considered it a hostile country, the United States did not.\n\nThe Thais and Japanese agreed that [[Shan State]] and [[Kayah State]] were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control. On 10 May 1942, the Thai [[Phayap Army]] entered Burma's eastern Shan State, which had been claimed by Siamese kingdoms. Three Thai infantry and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the air force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. [[Kengtung]], the main objective, was captured on 27 May. Renewed offensives in June and November saw the Chinese retreat into [[Yunnan]].<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027105102/http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |archivedate=2009-10-27|url=http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |title=Thailand and the Second World War }}</ref> The area containing the Shan States and Kayah State was annexed by Thailand in 1942. The areas were ceded back to [[Burma]] in 1945.\n\nThe [[Free Thai Movement]] (\"Seri Thai\") was established during these first few months. Parallel Free Thai organizations were also established in the United Kingdom. Queen [[Rambai Barni]] was the nominal head of the British-based organization, and [[Pridi Banomyong]], the regent, headed its largest contingent, which was operating within Thailand. Aided by elements of the military, secret airfields and training camps were established, while [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[Force 136]] agents slipped in and out of the country.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the Thai population came to resent the Japanese presence. In June 1944, Phibun was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The new civilian government under [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] attempted to aid the resistance while maintaining cordial relations with the Japanese. After the war, U. S. influence prevented Thailand from being treated as an Axis country, but the British demanded three million tons of rice as reparations and the return of areas annexed from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the war. Thailand also returned the portions of British Burma and French Indochina that had been annexed. Phibun and a number of his associates were put on trial on charges of having committed war crimes and of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, the charges were dropped due to intense public pressure. Public opinion was favorable to Phibun, as he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests.\n\n==Client states==\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n\n===German===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nThe collaborationist administrations of German-occupied countries in Europe had varying degrees of autonomy, and not all of them qualified as fully recognized [[sovereign state]]s. The [[General Government]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]] was a German administration, not a Polish government. In [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]], the [[Quisling regime|National Government]] headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] \u2013 whose name [[Quisling|came to symbolize pro-Axis collaboration]] in several languages \u2013 was subordinate to the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. It was never allowed to have any armed forces, be a recognized military partner, or have autonomy of any kind. In [[History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)|the occupied Netherlands]], [[Anton Mussert]] was given the symbolic title of \"F\u00fchrer of the Netherlands' people\". His [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]] formed a cabinet assisting the German administration, but was never recognized as a real Dutch government. The following list of German client states includes only those entities that were officially{{who|date=March 2020}} considered to be independent countries allied with Germany. They were under varying degrees of German influence and control, but were not ruled directly by Germans.\n\n====Albania (under German control)====\n{{Main|Albanian Kingdom (1943\u20131944)}}\nAfter the Italian armistice, a vacuum of power opened up in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]]. The Italian occupying forces were rendered largely powerless, as the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] took control of the south and the National Front ([[Balli Komb\u00ebtar]]) took control of the north. Albanians in the Italian army joined the guerrilla forces. In September 1943 the guerrillas moved to take the capital of [[Tirana]], but German paratroopers dropped into the city. Soon after the battle, the German High Command announced that they would recognize the independence of a [[greater Albania]]. They organized an Albanian government, police, and military in collaboration with the Balli Komb\u00ebtar. The Germans did not exert heavy control over Albania's administration, but instead attempted to gain popular appeal by giving their political partners what they wanted. Several Balli Komb\u00ebtar leaders held positions in the regime. The joint forces incorporated Kosovo, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, and Presevo into the Albanian state. A High Council of Regency was created to carry out the functions of a head of state, while the government was headed mainly by Albanian conservative politicians. Albania was the only European country occupied by the Axis powers that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war.{{sfn|Sarner|1997|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The Albanian government had refused to hand over their Jewish population.

It was appointed by the German Military Commander in Serbia and operated from 29 August 1941 to October 1944. The Serbian puppet state enjoyed significant support.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=David Bruce|title=Balkan holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian victim-centred propaganda and the war in Yugoslavia|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719064678|page=142}}</ref> The Prime Minister throughout was General [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]. The Government of National Salvation was evacuated from Belgrade to [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in the first week of October 1944 before the German withdrawal from Serbia was complete.\n\nRacial laws were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on Jews and Roma people, as well as causing the imprisonment of those opposed to Nazism. Several concentration camps were formed in Serbia and at the 1942 Anti-Freemason Exhibition in Belgrade the city was pronounced to be free of Jews (Judenfrei). On 1 April 1942, a Serbian Gestapo was formed. An estimated 120,000 people were interned in German-run concentration camps in Nedi\u0107's Serbia between 1941 and 1944. 50,000 to 80,000 were killed during this period. Serbia became the second country in Europe, following Estonia, to be proclaimed Judenfrei (free of Jews). Approximately 14,500 Serbian Jews \u2013 90 percent of Serbia's Jewish population of 16,000 \u2013 were murdered in World War II.\n\nCollaborationist armed formations forces were involved, either directly or indirectly, in the mass killings of Jews, Roma and those Serbs who sided with any anti-German resistance or were suspects of being a member of such. These forces were also responsible for the killings of many Croats and Muslims; however, some Croats who took refuge in Nedi\u0107's Serbia were not discriminated against. After the war, the Serbian involvement in many of these events and the issue of Serbian collaboration were subject to historical revisionism by later public figures.\n\nNedi\u0107 himself was captured by the Americans when they occupied the former territory of Austria, and was subsequently handed over to the Yugoslav communist authorities to act as a witness against war criminals, on the understanding he would be returned to American custody to face trial by the Allies. The Yugoslav authorities refused to return Nedi\u0107 to United States custody. He died on 4 February 1946 after either jumping or falling out of the window of a Belgrade hospital, under circumstances which remain unclear.\n\n====Italy (Italian Social Republic)====\n{{Main|Italian Social Republic}}\n[[File:Italian social republic map.png|thumb|Italian Social Republic]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-311-0926-07, Italien, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|left|RSI ([[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica Sociale Italiana]]) soldiers, March 1944]]\n\nItalian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] formed the Italian Social Republic (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) on 23 September 1943, succeeding the Kingdom of Italy as a member of the Axis.\n\nMussolini had been removed from office and arrested by King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July 1943. After the Italian armistice, in a [[Gran Sasso raid|raid]] led by German paratrooper [[Otto Skorzeny]], Mussolini was rescued from arrest.\n\nOnce restored to power, Mussolini declared that Italy was a [[republic]] and that he was the new head of state. He was subject to German control for the duration of the war.\n\n====Slovakia (Tiso regime)====\n{{Main|Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n[[File:Slovakia1941 02.png|thumb|Slovakia in 1941]]\nThe [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] under President [[Josef Tiso]] signed the Tripartite Pact on 24 November 1940.\n\nSlovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.\n\nSlovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in [[Spi\u0161]] and [[Orava (region)|Orava]]. Those two regions, along with [[Cieszyn Silesia]], had been [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the [[Munich Agreement]]. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.\n[[File:Andrzeja Olejko S\u0142owackie epizody z polskiego Podkarpacia Sanok 39.jpg|thumb|Slovak troops led by General [[Ferdinand \u010catlo\u0161]] (center) pose with a statue of [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] in [[Sanok]] during the Invasion of Poland.]]\nSlovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.\n\nSlovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.\n\nSlovakia was spared German military occupation until the [[Slovak National Uprising]], which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.\n\nAfter the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state. Slovakia and the Czech Republic finally separated into independent states in 1993.\n\n===Italian===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nItaly occupied several nations and set up clients in those regions to carry out administrative tasks and maintain order.\n\n====Monaco====\nThe [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] was officially neutral during the war. The population of the country was largely of Italian descent and sympathized with Italy. Its prince was a close friend of the Vichy French leader, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, an Axis collaborator. A fascist regime was established under the nominal rule of the prince when the Italian Fourth Army occupied the country on November 10, 1942 as a part of [[Case Anton]]. Monaco's military forces, consisting primarily of police and palace guards, collaborated with the Italians during the occupation. German troops occupied Monaco in 1943, and Monaco was liberated by Allied forces in 1944.\n\n===Joint German-Italian client states===\n<!-- Puppet states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n\n====Croatia (Independent State of Croatia)====\n{{Main|Independent State of Croatia}}\n[[File:Adolf Hitler meets Ante Paveli\u0107.1941.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] meeting with NDH leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]].]]\n\nOn 10 April 1941, the Independent State of Croatia (''Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska'', or NDH) declared itself a member of the Axis, co-signing the Tripartite Pact. The NDH remained a member of the Axis until the end of Second World War, its forces fighting for Germany even after its territory had been overrun by [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. On 16 April 1941, [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the [[Usta\u0161e]] (''\"Croatian Liberation Movement\"''), was proclaimed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of the new regime.\n\nInitially the Usta\u0161e had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's Fascist regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Paveli\u0107 as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. Italy intended to use the movement to destroy Yugoslavia, which would allow Italy to expand its power through the Adriatic. Hitler did not want to engage in a war in the Balkans until the Soviet Union was defeated. The Italian occupation of Greece was not going well; Mussolini wanted Germany to invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the Independent State of Croatia was created. Paveli\u0107 led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of Croatia to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned ''[[Tomislav II]], King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, [[Tuzla]] and Knin, Prince of [[Cisterna]] and of Belriguardo, Marquess of [[Voghera]], and Count of [[Ponderano]].'' The next day, Paveli\u0107 signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline.\n\nHowever, strong German influence began to be asserted soon after the NDH was founded. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.\n\nThe platform of the Usta\u0161e movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Usta\u0161e perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], together with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The regime enjoyed support amongst radical Croatian nationalists. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.\n\nUpon coming to power, Paveli\u0107 formed the Croatian Home Guard (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo'') as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Paveli\u0107 was also the supreme commander of the [[Usta\u0161e militia]], although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Usta\u0161e militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people]], as well as targeting those opposed to the fascist regime, and after June 1941 deported them to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] or to German camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Usta\u0161e militia. The exact number of victims of the Usta\u0161e regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.<ref name=\"US Holocaust Memorial Museum\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site</ref>\n\n====Greece (Hellenic State)====\n{{Main|Axis occupation of Greece|Hellenic State (1941\u20131944)}}\n[[File:Greece Prefectures 1941-44.png|thumb|Greece, 1941\u20131944]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]] of Greece and the flight of the [[Greek government in exile|Greek government]] to Crete and then Egypt, the [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Hellenic State]] was formed in May 1941 as a puppet state of both Italy and Germany. Initially, Italy had wished to annex Greece, but was pressured by Germany to avoid civil unrest such as had occurred in Bulgarian-annexed areas. The result was Italy accepting the creation of a puppet regime with the support of Germany. Italy had been assured by Hitler of a primary role in Greece. Most of the country was held by Italian forces, but strategic locations ([[Central Macedonia]], the islands of the northeastern Aegean, most of [[Crete]], and parts of [[Attica]]) were held by the Germans, who seized most of the country's economic assets and effectively controlled the collaborationist government. The puppet regime never commanded any real authority, and did not gain the allegiance of the people. It was somewhat successful in preventing secessionist movements like the [[Vlach \"Roman Legion\"]] from establishing themselves. By mid-1943, the [[Greek Resistance]] had liberated large parts of the mountainous interior (\"Free Greece\"), setting up a separate administration there. After the Italian armistice, the Italian occupation zone was taken over by the German armed forces, who remained in charge of the country until their withdrawal in autumn 1944. In some Aegean islands, German garrisons were left behind, and surrendered only after the end of the war.\n\n===Japanese===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n{{further|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\nThe Empire of Japan created a number of client states in the areas occupied by its military, beginning with the creation of Manchukuo in 1932. These puppet states achieved varying degrees of international recognition.\n\n====Burma (Ba Maw regime)====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Burma|State of Burma|Burma National Army}}\nThe Japanese Army and Burma nationalists, led by [[Aung San]], seized control of Burma from the United Kingdom during 1942. A [[State of Burma]] was formed on 1 August under the Burmese nationalist leader [[Ba Maw]]. The Ba Maw regime established the Burma Defence Army (later renamed the [[Burma National Army]]), which was commanded by [[Aung San]].\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Cambodia}}\nThe [[Colonial Cambodia#Emergence of Khmer nationalism|Kingdom of Cambodia]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 9 March 1945 to 15 August 1945.\n\nThe Japanese entered Cambodia in mid-1941, but allowed Vichy French officials to remain in administrative posts. The Japanese calls for an \"Asia for the Asiatics\" won over many Cambodian nationalists.\n\nThis policy changed during the last months of the war. The Japanese wanted to gain local support, so they dissolved French colonial rule and pressured Cambodia to declare its independence within the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Four days later, King [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]] declared Kampuchea (the original [[Khmer language|Khmer]] pronunciation of Cambodia) independent. Co-editor of the ''Nagaravatta'', [[Son Ngoc Thanh]], returned from Tokyo in May and was appointed foreign minister.\n\nOn the date of Japanese surrender, a new government was proclaimed with Son Ngoc Thanh as prime minister. When the Allies occupied [[Phnom Penh]] in October, Son Ngoc Thanh was arrested for collaborating with the Japanese and was exiled to France. Some of his supporters went to northwestern Cambodia, which had been under Thai control since the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940, where they banded together as one faction in the [[Khmer Issarak]] movement, originally formed with Thai encouragement in the 1940s.\n\n====China (Reorganized National Government of China)====\n{{Main|Wang Jingwei regime}}\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Japanese Army, including the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937\u20131940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] at [[Beijing]], which was formed in 1937, and the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. [[Wang Jingwei]] became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.\n\nThe Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.\n\nThe government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the [[Kuomintang]] led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\nThe worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanking Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist [[New Fourth Army]].\n\nWang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Chen Gongbo]]. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was [[Zhou Fohai]], the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. The state stuttered on for another year and continued the display and show of a fascist regime.\n\nOn 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General [[He Yingqin]], a nationalist general loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Nanking Army generals quickly declared their alliance to the Generalissimo, and were subsequently ordered to resist Communist attempts to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.\n\n====India (Provisional Government of Free India)====\n{{Main|Azad Hind Fauj|Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:INA Jubilation.jpg|thumb|[[Indian National Army]] soldiers in Asia]] -->\n\nThe ''Arzi Hukumat-e-[[Azad Hind]]'', the Provisional Government of Free India was a state that was recognized by nine Axis governments. It was led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], an [[Indian nationalist]] who rejected [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s nonviolent methods for achieving independence. The [[First INA]] faltered after its leadership objected to being a propaganda tool for Japanese war aims, and the role of [[I Kikan]]. It was revived by the [[Indian Independence League]] with Japanese support in 1942 after the ex-PoWs and Indian civilians in South-east Asia agreed to participate in the INA venture on the condition it was led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose declared India's independence on October 21, 1943. The Indian National Army was committed as a part of the [[U Go Offensive]]. It played a largely marginal role in the battle, and suffered serious casualties and had to withdraw with the rest of Japanese forces after the [[Battle of Imphal|siege of Imphal]] was broken. It was later committed to the defence of Burma [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|against the Allied offensive]]. It suffered a large number of desertions in this latter part. The remaining troops of the INA maintained order in Rangoon after the withdrawal of Ba Maw's government. although The provisional government was given nominal control of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] from November 1943 to August 1945.\n\n====Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang)====\n{{Main|Mengjiang}}\n[[Mengjiang]] was a Japanese puppet state in [[Inner Mongolia]]. It was nominally ruled by Prince [[Demchugdongrub]], a [[Mongol]] nobleman descended from [[Genghis Khan]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military. Mengjiang's independence was proclaimed on 18 February 1936, following the Japanese occupation of the region.\n\nThe Inner Mongolians had several grievances against the central Chinese government in Nanking, including their policy of allowing unlimited migration of Han Chinese to the region. Several of the young princes of Inner Mongolia began to agitate for greater freedom from the central government, and it was through these men that Japanese saw their best chance of exploiting Pan-Mongol nationalism and eventually seizing control of Outer Mongolia from the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan created Mengjiang to exploit tensions between ethnic Mongolians and the central government of China, which in theory ruled Inner Mongolia. When the various puppet governments of China were unified under the [[Wang Jingwei]] government in March 1940, Mengjiang retained its separate identity as an autonomous federation. Although under the firm control of the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied its territory, Prince Demchugdongrub had his own independent army.\n\nMengjiang vanished in 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II. As Soviet forces advanced into Inner Mongolia, they met limited resistance from small detachments of Mongolian cavalry, which, like the rest of the army, were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n====Laos====\n{{Main|French Protectorate of Laos#Japanese occupation of Laos}}\nFears of Thai irredentism led to the formation of the first Lao nationalist organization, the Movement for National Renovation, in January 1941. The group was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetxar\u0101t]] and supported by local French officials, though not by the Vichy authorities in [[Hanoi]]. This group wrote the current [[Pheng Xat Lao|Lao national anthem]] and designed the current [[Flag of Laos|Lao flag]], while paradoxically pledging support for France. The country declared its independence in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of France in 1944, bringing [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power, meant the end of the alliance between Japan and the Vichy French administration in Indochina. The Japanese had no intention of allowing the [[Gaullist]]s to take over, and in March 1945 they staged a military coup in Hanoi. Some French units fled over the mountains to Laos, pursued by the Japanese, who occupied [[Vientiane|Viang Chan]] in March 1945 and [[Luang Prabang|Luang Phrab\u0101ng]] in April. King [[Sisavang Vong|S\u012bsav\u0101ngvong]] was detained by the Japanese, but his son Crown Prince [[Savang Vatthana|Sav\u0101ngvatthan\u0101]] called on all [[Lao people|Lao]] to assist the French, and many Lao died fighting against the Japanese occupiers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nPrince Phetxar\u0101t opposed this position. He thought that Lao independence could be gained by siding with the Japanese, who made him Prime Minister of Luang Phrab\u0101ng, though not of Laos as a whole. The country was in chaos, and Phetxar\u0101t's government had no real authority. Another Lao group, the Lao S\u0113ri (Free Lao), received unofficial support from the Free Thai movement in the [[Isan]] region.\n\n====Manchuria (Manchukuo)====\n{{Main|Manchukuo}}\n[[File:Military exercise of Manchukuo Imperial Army.JPG|thumb|Manchurian soldiers training in a military exercise]]\n[[File:Manchukuo Air Force.JPG|thumb|Manchurian pilots of the Manchukuo Air Force]]\n\nManchukuo, in the northeast region of China, had been a Japanese puppet state in [[Manchuria]] since the 1930s. It was nominally ruled by [[Puyi]], the last emperor of the [[Qing Dynasty]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military, in particular the [[Kwantung Army]]. While Manchukuo ostensibly was a state for ethnic [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the region had a [[Han Chinese]] majority.\n\nFollowing the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the independence of Manchukuo was proclaimed on 18 February 1932, with Puyi as head of state. He was proclaimed the Emperor of Manchukuo a year later. The new Manchu nation was recognized by 23 of the [[League of Nations]]' 80 members. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were among the major powers who recognised Manchukuo. Other countries who recognized the State were the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Vatican City]]. Manchukuo was also recognised by the other Japanese allies and puppet states, including Mengjiang, the Burmese government of [[Ba Maw]], [[Thailand]], the Wang Jingwei regime, and the Indian government of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].

In the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Soviet Union gave military aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic]], against [[Spanish State|Spanish Nationalist]] forces, which were assisted by Germany and Italy. However, the Nationalist forces were victorious. The Soviets suffered another political defeat when their ally Czechoslovakia was partitioned and taken over by Germany in 1938\u201339. In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border conflicts, at [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan]] and [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. The latter was a major Soviet victory that led the Japanese Army to avoid war with the Soviets and instead call for expansion south.\n\nIn 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with either [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Britain and France]] or with Germany.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=112\u2013120}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=495\u2013496}} When negotiations with Britain and France failed, they turned to Germany and signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Germany was now freed from the risk of war with the Soviets, and was assured a supply of oil. This included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Romania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} The Soviet Union had been forced to cede the [[Kresy]] (Western [[Belarus]] and Western [[Ukraine]]) to Poland after losing the [[Soviet-Polish War]] of 1919\u20131921, and the Soviet Union sought to re-annex those territories.<ref name=\"Eastern Europe 2004, Pp. 138-139\"/>\n\nOn 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]]. The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland from the east]] on 17 September and on 28 September signed a [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|secret treaty]] with Nazi Germany to arrange coordination of fighting against Polish resistance. The Soviets targeted intelligence, entrepreneurs, and officers, committing a string of atrocities that culminated in the [[Katyn massacre]] and mass relocation to the [[Gulag]] in Siberia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/nazsov.asp|title=Avalon Project - Nazi-Soviet Relations 1939-1941|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref>\n\nSoon thereafter, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupied the Baltic countries]] of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,{{sfn|Senn|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}{{sfn|Wettig|2008|pp=20\u201321}} and annexed [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina|Northern Bukovina]] from Romania.

These and other export goods transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories allowed Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade.\n\nIn October and November 1940, [[German\u2013Soviet Axis talks|German-Soviet talks]] about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=58}}{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}} [[Joseph Stalin]] later personally countered with a separate proposal in a letter on 25 November that contained several secret protocols, including that \"the area south of [[Batum]] and [[Baku]] in the general direction of the [[Persian Gulf]] is recognized as the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union\", referring to an area approximating present day Iraq and Iran, and a Soviet claim to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}}{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}} Hitler never responded to Stalin's letter.{{sfn|Donaldson|Nogee|2005|pp=65\u201366}}{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=520\u2013521}} Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}}{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}}\n\nGermany ended the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} That resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the main members of [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].\n\nGermany then revived its Anti-Comintern Pact, enlisting many European and Asian countries in opposition to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war by the [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]]. The Soviet Union ended the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|by invading Manchukuo]] on 9 August 1945, due to agreements reached at the [[Yalta Conference]] with Roosevelt and Churchill.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Spain in World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg|thumb|Front row in order from left to right: [[Karl Wolff]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Francisco Franco]] and Spain's Foreign Minister [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er|Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]] in Madrid, October 1940.]]\n[[File:Franco-Mussolini-Serrano-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Franco]] (centre) and Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er (left) meeting with Mussolini (right) in [[Bordighera]], Italy in 1941.

This was accepted by Hitler and, within two weeks, there were more than enough volunteers to form a division \u2013 the [[Blue Division]] (''Divisi\u00f3n Azul'') under General [[Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes]].\n\nThe possibility of Spanish intervention in World War II was of concern to the United States, which investigated the activities of Spain's ruling Falange party in Latin America, especially [[Puerto Rico]], where pro-Falange and pro-Franco sentiment was high, even amongst the ruling upper classes.{{sfn|Leonard|Bratzel|2007|p=96}} The Falangists promoted the idea of supporting Spain's former colonies in fighting against American domination.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} Prior to the outbreak of war, support for Franco and the Falange was high in the Philippines.{{sfn|Steinberg|2000|p=122}} The [[Falange Exterior]], the international department of the Falange, collaborated with Japanese forces against U.S. and Filipino forces in the [[Philippines]] through the [[Philippine Falange]].{{sfn|Payne|1999|p=538}}\n\n===Vichy France===\n{{main|Vichy France}}\n[[File:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation.svg|thumb|France during the war; [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupied and annexed zones by Germany]] in shades of red, [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|Italian occupation zones]] in shades of green and striped blue, [[zone libre|\"Free zone\"]] in blue.]]\n\nAlthough officially neutral, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France|\"Vichy regime\"]] collaborated with the Axis from its creation on 10 July 1940. It retained full control of the [[zone libre|non-occupied part of France]] until November 1942, and a large part of France's [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]], until the colonies gradually fell under [[Free French]] control.\n\nThe German invasion army entered Paris on 14 June 1940, following the [[battle of France]]. P\u00e9tain became the last Prime Minister of the [[French Third Republic]] on 16 June 1940. He sued for peace with Germany and on 22 June 1940, the French government [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|concluded an armistice]] with Hitler and Mussolini, which came into effect at midnight on 25 June. Under the terms of the agreement, Germany [[occupied France|occupied two-thirds]] of France, including Paris. P\u00e9tain was permitted to keep an \"armistice army\" of 100,000 men within the unoccupied southern zone. This number included neither the army based in the [[French colonial empire]] nor the French fleet. In Africa the Vichy regime was permitted to maintain 127,000.{{sfn|Bachelier|2000|p=98}} The French also maintained substantial garrisons at the French-mandated territory of [[Syrian Republic (1930-1958)|Syria]] and [[Greater Lebanon]], the French colony of [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]], and in [[French Somaliland]]. Some members of the Vichy government pushed for closer cooperation, but they were rebuffed by P\u00e9tain. Neither did Hitler accept that France could ever become a full military partner,{{sfn|Paxton|1993}} and constantly prevented the buildup of Vichy's military strength.\n\nAfter the armistice, relations between the Vichy French and the British quickly worsened. Although the French had told Churchill they would not allow their fleet to be taken by the Germans, the British launched several naval attacks, the most notable of which was against [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|the Algerian harbour of Mers el-Kebir]] on 3 July 1940. Though Churchill defended his controversial decision to attack the French fleet, the action deteriorated greatly the relations between France and Britain. German propaganda trumpeted these attacks as an absolute betrayal of the French people by their former allies.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] (left) meeting with Hitler in October 1940.]]\n[[File:Flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|Personal flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of [[Vichy France]].]]\nOn 10 July 1940, P\u00e9tain was given emergency \"full powers\" by a majority vote of the [[French National Assembly]]. The following day approval of the new constitution by the Assembly effectively created the [[French State]] (''l'\u00c9tat Fran\u00e7ais''), replacing the French Republic with the government unofficially called \"Vichy France,\" after the resort town of [[Vichy]], where P\u00e9tain maintained his seat of government. This continued to be recognised as the lawful government of France by the neutral United States until 1942, while the United Kingdom had recognised [[Free France|de Gaulle's government-in-exile in London]]. Racial laws were introduced in France and its colonies and many [[History of the Jews in France|foreign Jews in France]] were deported to Germany. [[Albert Lebrun]], last President of the Republic, did not resign from the presidential office when he moved to [[Vizille]] on 10 July 1940. By 25 April 1945, during P\u00e9tain's trial, Lebrun argued that he thought he would be able to return to power after the fall of Germany, since he had not resigned.<ref>[http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html Albert Lebrun's biography, French Republic Presidential official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414173559/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html |date=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1940, Vichy France [[invasion of French Indochina|was forced to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina]], a federation of French colonial possessions and protectorates encompassing modern day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation. [[French Indochina]] was the base for the Japanese [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invasions of Thailand]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], and [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]]. In 1945, [[geacps|under Japanese sponsorship]], the [[Empire of Vietnam]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia#Collaborationist Kingdom of Kampuchea|Kingdom of Kampuchea]] were proclaimed as Japanese puppet states.\n\nOn 26 September 1940, de Gaulle [[Battle of Dakar|led an attack by Allied forces on the Vichy port of Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]. Forces loyal to P\u00e9tain fired on de Gaulle and repulsed the attack after two days of heavy fighting, drawing Vichy France closer to Germany.\n\nDuring the [[Anglo\u2013Iraqi War]] of May 1941, Vichy France allowed Germany and Italy to use air bases in the [[French mandate of Syria]] to support the Iraqi revolt. British and Free French forces attacked later [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria and Lebanon in June\u2013July 1941]], and in 1942 Allied forces [[Battle of Madagascar|took over French Madagascar]]. More and more colonies abandoned Vichy, joining the Free French territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]], [[French Polynesia|Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]] and others who had sided with de Gaulle [[Appeal of 18 June|from the start]].\n\nIn November 1942 Vichy French troops briefly resisted the [[Operation Torch|landing of Allied troops in French North Africa]] for two days, until Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] negotiated a local ceasefire with the Allies. In response to the landings, [[Case Anton|Axis troops invaded]] the non-occupied zone in southern France and ended Vichy France as an entity with any kind of autonomy; it then became a puppet government for the occupied territories.\n\nIn June 1943, the formerly Vichy-loyal colonial authorities in [[French North Africa]] led by [[Henri Giraud]] came to an agreement with the [[Free French]] to merge with their own interim regime with the [[Free France#Creation of the French National Committee (CNF)|French National Committee]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais National'', CFN) to form a [[provisional government]] in [[Algiers]], known as the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale'', CFLN) initially led by Darlan. After his assassination De Gaulle emerged as the uncontested French leader. The CFLN raised more troops and re-organised, re-trained and re-equipped the Free French military, in cooperation with Allied forces in preparation of future operations [[Operation Husky|against Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|German Atlantic wall]].\n\nIn 1943 the [[Milice]], a paramilitary force which had been founded by Vichy, was subordinated to the Germans and assisted them in rounding up opponents and Jews, as well as fighting the [[French Resistance]]. The Germans recruited volunteers in units independent of Vichy. Partly as a result of the great animosity of many right-wingers against the pre-war [[Front Populaire]], volunteers joined the German forces in their anti-communist crusade against the USSR. Almost 7,000 joined ''[[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|L\u00e9gion des Volontaires Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (LVF) from 1941 to 1944. The LVF then formed the cadre of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Waffen-SS Division ''Charlemagne'']] in 1944\u20131945, with a maximum strength of some 7,500. Both the LVF and the ''Division Charlemagne'' fought on the eastern front.\n\nDeprived of any military assets, territory or resources, the members of the Vichy government continued to fulfil their role as German puppets, being quasi-prisoners in the so-called \"[[Sigmaringen enclave]]\" in a castle in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at the end of the war in May 1945.\n\n==German, Italian and Japanese World War II cooperation==\n===German-Japanese Axis-cooperation===\n{{Main|Germany\u2013Japan relations#Rapprochement, Axis and World War II (1920\u20131945)}}\n{{see also|Germany\u2013Japan industrial co-operation before World War II}}\n\n===Germany's and Italy's declaration of war against the United States===\nOn 7 December 1941, Japan [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the US naval bases in Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.

The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity.\n\nThe Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the treaty signed by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in October 1936. [[Benito Mussolini]] declared on 1 November 1936 that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome\u2013Berlin axis, thus creating the term \"Axis\".<ref name=\"Schmitz\">{{cite book |author=Cornelia Schmitz-Berning |title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=745 |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-11-019549-1 }}<!--|accessdate=26 March 2015 --></ref><ref name=\"GlobSec\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/int/axis.htm |title=Axis |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}</ref> The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], an anti-communist treaty between Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Italy joined the Pact in 1937. The \"Rome\u2013Berlin Axis\" became a [[Collective defense|military alliance]] in 1939 under the so-called \"[[Pact of Steel]]\", with the [[Tripartite Pact]] of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nAt its zenith during World War II, the Axis presided over territories that occupied large parts of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and [[East Asia]]. There were no three-way summit meetings and cooperation and coordination was minimal, with slightly more between Germany and Italy. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis powers and the dissolution of their alliance. As in the case of the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, with some nations switching sides or changing their degree of military involvement over the course of the war.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Origins and creation==\n{{Fascism sidebar}}\n{{Main|Tripartite Pact}}\nThe term \"axis\" was first applied to the Italo-German relationship by the Italian prime minister [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1923, when he wrote in the preface to Roberto Suster's ''Germania Repubblica'' that \"there is no doubt that in this moment the axis of European history passes through Berlin\" (''non v'ha dubbio che in questo momento l'asse della storia europea passa per Berlino'').<ref>Martin-Dietrich Glessgen and G\u00fcnter Holtus, eds., ''Genesi e dimensioni di un vocabolario etimologico'', Lessico Etimologico Italiano: Etymologie und Wortgeschichte des Italienischen (Ludwig Reichert, 1992), p. 63.</ref> At the time, he was seeking an alliance with the [[Weimar Republic]] against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in the dispute over the [[Free State of Fiume]].<ref name=Watt>D.

When Mussolini publicly announced the signing on 1 November, he proclaimed the creation of a Rome\u2013Berlin axis.<ref name=Watt/>\n\n===Initial proposals of a German\u2013Italian alliance===\nItaly under ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] had pursued a strategic alliance of Italy with Germany against France since the early 1920s.<ref name=\"MacGregor Knox 2000.

The German ambassador to Italy in 1924 reported that Mussolini saw a nationalist Germany as an essential ally for Italy against France, and hoped to tap into the desire within the German army and the German political right for a war of revenge against France.<ref name=\"MacGregor Knox 2000. Pp. 124\"/>\n\nDuring the Weimar Republic, the German government did not respect the Treaty of Versailles that it had been pressured to sign, and various government figures at the time rejected Germany's post-Versailles borders. General [[Hans von Seeckt]] (head of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' command from 1920 to 1926) supported an alliance between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] to invade and partition Poland between them and restore the German-Russian border of 1914.<ref name=\"Christian Leitz p10\">Christian Leitz.

Common Destiny: Dictatorship, Foreign Policy, and War in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Pp. 125.</ref>\n\nMeetings took place in Berlin in 1924 between Italian General [[Luigi Capello]] and prominent figures in the German military, such as von Seeckt and [[Erich Ludendorff]], over military collaboration between Germany and Italy. The discussions concluded that Germans still wanted a war of revenge against France but were short on weapons and hoped that Italy could assist Germany.<ref>John Gooch.

Pp. 124\"/> Italian foreign minister [[Dino Grandi]] in the early 1930s stressed the importance of \"decisive weight\", involving Italy's relations between France and Germany, in which he recognized that Italy was not yet a major power, but perceived that Italy did have strong enough influence to alter the political situation in Europe by placing the weight of its support onto one side or another.<ref>Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 113.</ref> However Grandi stressed that Italy must seek to avoid becoming a \"slave of the rule of three\" in order to pursue its interests, arguing that although substantial Italo-French tensions existed, Italy would not unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with Germany, just as it would neither unconditionally commit itself to an alliance with France over conceivable Italo-German tensions.<ref>Gerhard Schreiber, Bern Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War''. Oxford University Press, 1995. P. 113.</ref> Grandi's attempts to maintain a diplomatic balance between France and Germany were challenged in 1932 by pressure from the French, who had begun to prepare an alliance with Britain and the United States against the threat of a revanchist Germany.<ref name=\"burgwyn\">H.

G\u00f6mb\u00f6s responded to Mussolini that as the Austrians primarily identified as Germans, the [[Anschluss]] of Austria to Germany was inevitable, and advised that it would be better for Italy to have a friendly Germany across the [[Brenner Pass]] than a hostile Germany bent on entering the Adriatic.<ref name=\"burgwyn\"/> Mussolini said he hoped the Anschluss could be postponed as long as possible until the breakout of a European war that he estimated would begin in 1938.<ref name=\"burgwyn\"/>\n\n[[File:Adolf Hitler-1933.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]], ''F\u00fchrer and Reich Chancellor of the German People'', 1933\u20131945]]\nIn 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi Party [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in Germany.

Germany needed access to the territory held by Yugoslavia to allow German forces to have a direct route to travel through, to reach and rescue Italian military forces that were faltering in their campaign in Greece. There was substantial animosity towards the alliance amongst Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group, who had fought German Austrians and Germany on the side of the Allies in World War I, and three Serb cabinet ministers resigned their positions in protest after the alliance was signed. Hitler initially attempted to be conciliatory to the Serbs who held animosity to the agreement, saying that he \"understood the feelings\" of those Serbs who opposed the alliance. Amidst the negotiations, Hitler expressed concern to Italian foreign minister Ciano that he sensed trouble coming in Belgrade. A coup d'\u00e9tat occurred in Yugoslavia in which a government rose to power and abandoned its association with the Axis. Hitler accused the coup of being engineered by the British. The coup was at least partly supported by the British though there was substantial patriotic enthusiasm against the Pact with rallies in Belgrade. At the rallies in Belgrade immediately after the coup, people were heard to be shouting \"Better war than pact!\" and waving British, American, and French flags.

The pressure of the reparations on the German economy led to [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation during the early 1920s]]. In 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupied the Ruhr region]] when Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. Although Germany began to improve economically in the mid-1920s, the [[Great Depression]] created more economic hardship and a rise in political forces that advocated radical solutions to Germany's woes. The Nazis, under Hitler, promoted the nationalist [[stab-in-the-back legend]] stating that Germany had been betrayed by Jews and Communists. The party promised to rebuild Germany as a major power and create a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] that would include [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Sudetenland]], and other German-populated territories in Europe. The Nazis also aimed to occupy and colonize non-German territories in [[Poland]], the [[Baltic states]], and the Soviet Union, as part of the Nazi policy of seeking ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") in eastern Europe.\n\nGermany renounced the Versailles treaty and [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the Rhineland]] in March 1936. Germany had already resumed conscription and announced the existence of a German air force, the [[Luftwaffe]], and naval force, the [[Kriegsmarine]] in 1935. Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in 1938]], the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudetenland]] from Czechoslovakia, and the [[Memel territory]] from [[Lithuania]] in 1939. Germany then invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939, creating the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the country of [[Slovakia]].\n\nOn 23 August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], which contained a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} Germany's invasion of its part of Poland under the Pact eight days later{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} triggered the beginning of World War II. By the end of 1941, Germany occupied a large part of Europe and [[Wehrmacht|its military forces]] were fighting the Soviet Union, nearly capturing Moscow. However, crushing defeats at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Kursk]] devastated the German armed forces. This, combined with Western Allied [[Normandy Landings|landings in France]] and [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Italy]], led to a three-front war that depleted Germany's armed forces and resulted in Germany's defeat in 1945.\n\nThere was substantial internal opposition within the German military to the Nazi regime's aggressive strategy of rearmament and foreign policy in the 1930s.<ref>Command Magagzine.

Shortly after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia declared its independence. The new [[Slovak State]] allied itself with Germany. The remainder of the country was occupied by German military forces and organized into the Protectorate. Czech civil institutions were preserved but the Protectorate was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nThe [[General Government]] was the name given to the territories of occupied Poland that were not directly annexed into German provinces, but like Bohemia and Moravia was considered within the sovereign territory of Germany.\n\nBelgium quickly surrendered to Germany, and the Belgian King remained in the country during the German military occupation from 1940 to 1944. The Belgian King cooperated closely with Germany and repeatedly sought assurances that Belgian rights would be retained once Germany achieved total victory. However, Hitler intended to annex Belgium and its Germanic population into the Greater Germanic Reich, initiated by the creation of [[Reichskommissariat Belgien]], an authority run directly by the German government that sought the incorporation of the territory into the planned Germanic Reich. However Belgium was soon occupied by Allied forces in 1944.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Niederlande]] was an occupation authority and territory established in the Netherlands in 1940 designated as a colony to be incorporated into the planned Greater Germanic Reich.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]] was established in Norway in 1940. Like the Reichskommissariats in Belgium and the Netherlands, its Germanic peoples were to be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich. In Norway, the [[Quisling regime]], headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]], was installed by the Germans as a client regime [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|during the occupation]], while king [[Haakon VII]] and the legal [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government were in exile]]. Quisling encouraged Norwegians to serve as volunteers [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|in the Waffen-SS]], collaborated in the deportation of Jews, and was responsible for the executions of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].\n\nAbout 45,000 Norwegian collaborators joined the pro-Nazi party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union), and some police units helped arrest many Jews. However, Norway was one of the first countries where [[resistance during World War II]] was widespread before the turning point of the war in 1943. After the war, [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Quisling and other collaborators were executed]]. Quisling's name has become an international [[eponym]] for [[traitor]].\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] was established in the Baltic region in 1941. Unlike the western Reichskommissariats that sought the incorporation of their majority Germanic peoples, Ostland were designed for settlement by Germans who would displace the non-Germanic majority living there, as part of ''lebensraum''.\n\n[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] was established in Ukraine in 1941. Like Ostland it was slated for settlement by Germans.\n\nThe [[Military Administration in Serbia]] was established on occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] territory in April 1941, following the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the country]]. On 30 April a pro-German Serbian administration was formed under [[Milan A\u0107imovi\u0107]] to serve as a civil administration in the military occupation zone. A joint [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] and [[Chetnik]] uprising in late 1941 became a serious concern for the Germans, as most of their forces were deployed to Russia; only three divisions were in the country. On 13 August 546 Serbs, including some of the country's prominent and influential leaders, issued an appeal to the Serbian nation that condemned the Partisan and royalist resistance as unpatriotic. Two weeks after the appeal, with the Partisan and royalist insurgency beginning to gain momentum, 75 prominent Serbs convened a meeting in Belgrade and formed a [[Government of National Salvation]] under Serbian General [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] to replace the existing Serbian administration. The Germans were short of police and military forces in Serbia, and came to rely on poorly armed Serbian formations, the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], to maintain order. These forces, however, were not able to contain the resistance, and for the most of the war large parts of Serbia were under control of the Partisans or Chetniks (the two resistance movements soon became mutually-hostile). The Government of National Salvation, imbued with few powers upon formation, saw its functions further decreased and taken over by the [[Wehrmacht]] occupation authorities as the war progressed. After the initial mass revolts, the German authorities instituted an extreme regime of reprisals, proclaiming that 100 civilians would be executed for every German soldier killed, and 50 for each one wounded. These measures were actually implemented on more than one occasion: large-scale shootings took place in the Serbian towns of [[Kraljevo massacre|Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]] during October 1941.\n\n===Italy===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Italy|Italian Empire|Imperial Italy (fascist)|Latin Bloc (proposed alliance)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-09, Nordafrika, italienische Soldaten auf dem Marsch.jpg|thumb|Italian soldiers in the [[North African Campaign]] in 1941]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0104-38, Nordafrika, italienische Panzer M13-40.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Fiat M13/40]] tanks in the North African Campaign in 1941]]\n[[File:Veneto guns at Gaudos.jpg|thumb|Italian battleship ''[[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]'' firing at Allied warships during the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016230-0008, Bersaglieri in Jugoslawien.jpg|thumb|Italian ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' in the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]]]]\n[[File:Macchi200 m2.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Macchi C.200]] fighter aircraft during the war]]\n\n====War justifications====\n\n''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] described Italy's declaration of war against the Western Allies of Britain and France in June 1940 as the following: \"We are going to war against the [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] and [[reactionary]] [[Democracy|democracies]] of the [[Western world|West]] who have invariably hindered the progress and often threatened the very existence of the [[Italians|Italian people]]\".<ref>John Whittam.

There was a desire to annex [[Dalmatia]]n territories, which had formerly been ruled by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and which consequently had Italian-speaking elites. The intention of the Fascist regime was to create a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\" in which Italy would dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In 1935\u20131936 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia]] and the Fascist government proclaimed the creation of the \"Italian Empire\".{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2002|p=289}} Protests by the [[League of Nations]], especially the British, who had interests in that area, led to no serious action, although The League did try to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. In 1937 Italy left the League of Nations and joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which had been signed by Germany and Japan the preceding year. In March/April 1939 Italian troops invaded and annexed [[Albania]]. Germany and Italy signed the [[Pact of Steel]] on May 22.\n\nItaly entered World War II on 10 June 1940. In September 1940 Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]].\n\nItaly was ill-prepared for war, in spite of the fact that it had continuously been involved in conflict since 1935, first with Ethiopia in 1935\u20131936 and then in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the side of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=40\u201341}} \nMussolini refused to heed warnings from his minister of exchange and currency, Felice Guarneri, who said that Italy's actions in Ethiopia and Spain meant that Italy was on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} By 1939 military expenditures by Britain and France far exceeded what Italy could afford.{{sfn|McKercher|Legault|2001|p=41}} As a result of Italy's economic difficulties its soldiers were poorly paid, often being poorly equipped and poorly supplied, and animosity arose between soldiers and class-conscious officers; these contributed to low morale amongst Italian soldiers.<ref>[[Samuel W.

Power over the military was overcentralized to Mussolini's direct control; he personally undertook to direct the ministry of war, the navy, and the air force.

By March 1940, Mussolini decided that Italy would intervene, but the date was not yet chosen. His senior military leadership unanimously opposed the action because Italy was unprepared. No raw materials had been stockpiled and the reserves it did have would soon be exhausted, Italy's industrial base was only one-tenth of Germany's, and even with supplies the Italian military was not organized to provide the equipment needed to fight a modern war of a long duration. An ambitious rearmament program was impossible because of Italy's limited reserves in gold and foreign currencies and lack of raw materials. Mussolini ignored the negative advice.<ref>Stephen L. W.

On 12 September 1943, Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in [[Gran Sasso raid|Operation Oak]] and placed in charge of a puppet state called the [[Italian Social Republic]] (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana''/RSI, or ''Repubblica di Sal\u00f2'') in [[northern Italy]]. The war went on for months as the Allies, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] and the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] contended the Social Republic's forces and its German allies. Some areas in Northern Italy were liberated from the Germans as late as May, 1945.

Initially, the Italians intended that Montenegro would become an \"independent\" state closely allied with Italy, reinforced through the strong dynastic links between Italy and Montenegro, as [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena of Italy]] was a daughter of the last Montenegrin king [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]]. The Italian-backed Montenegrin nationalist [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]] and his followers attempted to create a Montenegrin state. On 12 July 1941, they proclaimed the \"Kingdom of Montenegro\" under the protection of Italy. In less than 24 hours, that triggered a [[Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|general uprising against the Italians]]. Within three weeks, the insurgents managed to capture almost all the territory of Montenegro. Over 70,000 Italian troops and 20,000 of [[Albanian Kingdom (1939\u201343)|Albanian]] and [[Sand\u017eak Muslim militia|Muslim]] irregulars were deployed to suppress the rebellion. Drljevic was expelled from Montenegro in October 1941. Montenegro then came under full direct Italian control. With the Italian capitulation of 1943, Montenegro came directly under the control of Germany.\n\n[[Albanian Kingdom (1939\u20131943)|Albania]] was an Italian protectorate and dependency from 1939 to 1943. In spite of Albania's long-standing protection and alliance with Italy, on 7 April 1939 Italian troops [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] Albania, five months before the start of the Second World War.

As a result, the United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a halt by imposing an embargo on all trade between the United States and Japan. Japan was dependent on the United States for 80 percent of its [[petroleum]], and as a consequence the embargo resulted in an economic and military crisis for Japan, as Japan could not continue its war effort against China without access to petroleum.<ref>Euan Graham.

Under the emperor were a political cabinet and the [[Imperial General Headquarters]], with two chiefs of staff. By 1945 the Emperor of Japan was more than a symbolic leader; he played a major role in devising a strategy to keep himself on the throne.<ref>Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'' (2001) ch 13</ref>\n\nAt its peak, Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] included [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], large parts of [[China]], [[Malaysia]], [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[The Philippines]], [[Burma]], a small part of India, and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific.\n\nAs a result of the internal discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's expansionist policies alienated it from other countries in the [[League of Nations]] and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar expansionist policies. Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan entered into conflict [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against the Chinese]] in 1937. The Japanese invasion and occupation of parts of China resulted in numerous atrocities against civilians, such as the [[Nanking massacre]] and the [[Three Alls Policy]]. The Japanese also [[Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts|fought skirmishes]] with Soviet\u2013[[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolian]] forces in [[Manchukuo]] in 1938 and 1939. Japan sought to avoid war with the Soviet Union by signing a non-aggression pact with it in 1941.\n\n[[File:Greater Asian Co-prosperity sphere.png|thumb|left|The Empire of Japan (darker red) and territories controlled by Japanese puppet states during the war (lighter red). Thailand (darkest red) cooperated with Japan. All are members of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].]]\nJapan's military leaders were divided on diplomatic relationships with Germany and Italy and the attitude towards the United States. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] was in favour of war with the United States, but the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was generally strongly opposed. When [[Prime Minister of Japan]] General [[Hideki Tojo]] refused American demands that Japan withdraw its military forces from China, a confrontation became more likely.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=5}} War with the United States was being discussed within the Japanese government by 1940.{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}} Commander of the Combined Fleet Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] was outspoken in his opposition, especially after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, saying on 14 October 1940: \"To fight the United States is like fighting the whole world. But it has been decided. So I will fight the best I can. Doubtless I shall die on board {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} [his flagship]. Meanwhile Tokyo will be burnt to the ground three times. Konoe and others will be torn to pieces by the revengeful people, I [shouldn't] wonder. \"{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}} In October and November 1940, Yamamoto communicated with Navy Minister Oikawa, and stated, \"Unlike the pre-Tripartite days, great determination is required to make certain that we avoid the danger of going to war. \"{{sfn|Asada|2006|pp=275\u2013276}}\n\nWith the European powers focused on the war in Europe, Japan sought to acquire their colonies. In 1940 Japan responded to the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] by occupying [[French Indochina]]. The [[Vichy France]] regime, a ''de facto'' ally of Germany, accepted the takeover. The allied forces did not respond with war. However, the United States instituted an embargo against Japan in 1941 because of the continuing war in China. This cut off Japan's supply of scrap metal and oil needed for industry, trade, and the war effort.\n\nTo isolate the US forces stationed in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and to reduce US naval power, the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] ordered [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|an attack]] on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, on 7 December 1941. They also invaded [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Initially achieving a series of victories, by 1943 the Japanese forces were driven back towards the home islands. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The Soviets formally declared war in August 1945 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|engaged Japanese forces]] in Manchuria and northeast China.\n\n====Colonies and dependencies====\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indonesische jongens tijdens hun soldatentraining door de Japanners TMnr 10001989.jpg|thumb|Japanese officers training Indonesian recruits]]\nTaiwan, then known as Formosa, was a Japanese dependency established in 1895.\n\nKorea was a Japanese protectorate and dependency formally established by the [[Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910]].\n\nThe [[South Pacific Mandate]] were territories granted to Japan in 1919 in the peace agreements of World War I, that designated to Japan the German South Pacific islands. Japan received these as a reward by the Allies of World War I, when Japan was then allied against Germany.\n\nJapan occupied the [[Dutch East Indies]] during the war. Japan planned to transform these territories into a client state of [[Indonesia]] and sought alliance with Indonesian nationalists including future Indonesian President [[Sukarno]], however these efforts did not deliver the creation of an Indonesian state until after Japan's surrender.<ref>Li Narangoa, R. B. Cribb. ''Imperial Japan and National Identities in Asia, 1895-1945''. Psychology Press, 2003. P15-16.</ref>\n\n==Subsequent signatories of the Tripartite Pact==\nIn addition to the 3 major Axis powers, 4 more countries and 2 puppet regimes signed the Tri-Partite Pact as its member states. Of the 4 countries, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria participated in various Axis military operations with their national armed forces, while the 4th, Yugoslavia, saw its pro-Nazi government overthrown in a coup merely days after it signed the Pact, and the membership was reversed.\n\nThe 2 puppet regimes that signed the Tri-Partite Pact, Tiso-led Slovakia and the Independent State of Croatia are listed among the client states section below.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army 1941.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the Balkans campaign]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] was ruled by [[Boris III of Bulgaria|\u0422sar Boris III]] when it signed the Tripartite Pact on 1 March 1941. Bulgaria had been on the losing side in the First World War and sought a return of lost ethnically and historically Bulgarian territories, specifically in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]] (all within [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] and [[Turkey]]). During the 1930s, because of traditional right-wing elements, Bulgaria drew closer to Nazi Germany. In 1940 Germany pressured Romania to sign the [[Treaty of Craiova]], returning to Bulgaria the region of [[Southern Dobrudja]], which it had lost in 1913. The Germans also promised Bulgaria \u2014 if it joined the Axis \u2014 an enlargement of its territory to the borders specified in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]].\n\nBulgaria participated in the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and Greece by letting German troops attack from its territory and sent troops to Greece on April 20. As a reward, the Axis powers allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of both countries\u2014southern and south-eastern Yugoslavia ([[Vardar Banovina]]) and north-eastern Greece (parts of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Greek Thrace]]). The Bulgarian forces in these areas spent the following years fighting various nationalist groups and [[resistance movement]]s. Despite German pressure, Bulgaria did not take part in the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]] and actually never declared war on the Soviet Union. The [[Bulgarian Navy]] was nonetheless involved in a number of skirmishes with the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping.\n\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Bulgarian government declared war on the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. This action remained largely symbolic (at least from the Bulgarian perspective), until August 1943, when Bulgarian air defense and air force attacked Allied bombers, returning (heavily damaged) from a mission over the Romanian oil refineries. This turned into a disaster for the citizens of [[Sofia]] and other major Bulgarian cities, which were heavily bombed by the Allies in the winter of 1943\u20131944.\n\nOn 2 September 1944, as the [[Red Army]] approached the Bulgarian border, a new Bulgarian government came to power and sought peace with the Allies, expelled the few remaining German troops, and declared neutrality. These measures however did not prevent the Soviet Union from declaring war on Bulgaria on 5 September, and on 8 September the Red Army marched into the country, meeting no resistance. This was followed by the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 September 1944]], which brought a government of the pro-Soviet [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] to power. After this, the Bulgarian army (as part of the Red Army's [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]) fought the Germans in Yugoslavia and Hungary, sustaining numerous casualties. Despite this, the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] treated Bulgaria as one of the defeated countries. Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but had to give up all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{Main|Hungary during World War II|Government of National Unity (Hungary)}}\n[[File:Toldi.jpg|thumb|Hungarian [[Toldi (tank)|Toldi I]] tank as used during the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]][[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], ruled by [[Regent]] Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], was the first country apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan to adhere to the Tripartite Pact, signing the agreement on 20 November 1940. Slovakia had been a client state of Germany since 1939.<ref>Seamus Dunn, T.G. Fraser. Europe and Ethnicity: The First World War and Contemporary Ethnic Conflict. Routledge, 1996. P97.</ref>\n\nPolitical instability plagued the country until Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, a Hungarian nobleman and [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian naval]] officer, became regent in 1920. The vast majority of the Hungarians desired to recover territories lost through the [[Trianon Treaty]]. The country drew closer to Germany and Italy largely because of a shared desire to revise the peace settlements made after World War I.{{sfn|Montgomery|2002|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} Many people sympathized with the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] policy of the Nazi regime. Due to its supportive stance towards Germany and the new efforts in the international policy, Hungary gained favourable territorial settlements by the [[First Vienna Award]], after the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] occupied and annexed the remainder of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and in 1940 received [[Northern Transylvania]] from Romania via the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Hungarians permitted German troops to transit through their territory during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], and Hungarian forces took part in the invasion. Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary; the United Kingdom immediately broke off diplomatic relations in response.\n\nAlthough Hungary did not initially participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hungary and the [[Soviet Union]] became belligerents on 27 June 1941. Over 500,000 soldiers served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. All five of Hungary's field armies ultimately participated in the war against the Soviet Union; a significant contribution was made by the [[Hungarian Second Army]].[[File:Hungarian soldiers in the Carpathians.jpg|thumb|Hungarian soldiers in the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1944]]\n\nOn 25 November 1941, Hungary was one of thirteen signatories to the revived Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian troops, like their Axis counterparts, were involved in numerous actions against the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets had gained the upper hand and the Germans were retreating. The Hungarian Second Army was destroyed in fighting on the [[Voronezh Front]], on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. In 1944, with Soviet troops advancing toward Hungary, Horthy attempted to reach an armistice with the Allies. However, the Germans [[Operation Panzerfaust|replaced the existing regime with a new one]]. After fierce fighting, Budapest was taken by the Soviets. A number of pro-German Hungarians retreated to Italy and Germany, where they fought until the end of the war.\n[[File:Rep\u00fcl\u0151t\u00e9r, 1944. \u00e1prilis 13.

Horthy was forced to abdicate after German commandos, led by Colonel [[Otto Skorzeny]], held his son hostage as part of [[Operation Panzerfaust]].\n\nHungary was reorganized following Horthy's abdication in December 1944 into a totalitarian fascist regime called the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Government of National Unity]], led by [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]]. He had been Prime Minister of Hungary since October 1944 and was leader of the anti-Semitic fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. In power, his government was a puppet regime with little authority, and the country was effectively under German control. Days after the Sz\u00e1lasi government took power, the capital of [[Budapest]] was surrounded by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. German and Hungarian fascist forces tried to hold off the Soviet advance but failed. In March 1945, Sz\u00e1lasi fled to Germany as the leader of a government in exile, until the surrender of Germany in May 1945.\n\n===Romania===\n{{Main|Romania in World War II|Romanian Navy during World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B03212, M\u00fcnchen, Staatsbesuch Jon Antonescu bei Hitler.jpg|thumb|Ion Antonescu and [[Adolf Hitler]] at the ''[[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen|F\u00fchrerbau]]'' in [[Munich]] (June 1941)]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-218-0501-27, Russland-S\u00fcd, rum\u00e4nische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|right|Romanian soldiers on the outskirts of Stalingrad during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942]]\n[[File:IAR80.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of Romanian [[IAR80]] fighter aircraft]]\n\nWhen war erupted in Europe in 1939, the [[Kingdom of Romania]] was pro-British and allied to the [[Polish-Romanian alliance|Poles]].

In an effort to appease the Fascist elements within the country and obtain German protection, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] appointed the General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister on September 6, 1940.\n\nTwo days later, Antonescu forced the king to abdicate and installed the king's young son [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai) on the throne, then declared himself ''Conduc\u0103tor'' (\"Leader\") with dictatorial powers. The [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed on 14 September, with the [[Iron Guard]] ruling together with Antonescu as the sole legal political movement in Romania. Under King Michael I and the military government of Antonescu, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] on November 23, 1940.

From late 1940 Hitler sought a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. In February 1941, Hitler called for Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact, the Yugoslav delayed.  In March, divisions of the German army arrived at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border and permission was sought for them to pass through to attack Greece. On 25 March 1941, fearing that Yugoslavia would be invaded otherwise, the Yugoslav government signed the Tripartite Pact with significant reservations. Unlike other Axis powers, Yugoslavia was not obliged to provide military assistance, nor to provide its territory for Axis to move military forces during the war. Less than two days later, after demonstrations in the streets of Belgrade, Prince Paul and the government were removed from office by a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Seventeen-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]] was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]], refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, and started negotiations with Great Britain and Soviet Union. Winston Churchill commented that \"Yugoslavia has found its soul\"; however, Hitler invaded and quickly took control.\n\n==Co-belligerent state combatants==\nVarious countries fought side by side with the Axis powers for a common cause. These countries were not signatories of the Tripartite Pact and thus not formal members of the Axis.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Military history of Finland during World War II}}\n\nAlthough Finland never signed the Tripartite Pact and legally ''(de jure)'' was not a part of the Axis, it was Axis-aligned in its fight against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=134}} Finland signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1941.<ref>Kent Forster, \"Finland's Foreign Policy 1940-1941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,\" ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp 109-123</ref>\n\nThe August 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union contained a secret protocol dividing much of eastern Europe and assigning Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}}{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=120}} After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in November 1939 during the [[Winter War]], intending to establish a communist puppet government in Finland.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|pp=120\u2013121}}{{sfn|Kennedy-Pipe|1995|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The conflict threatened Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region.{{sfn|Kirby|1979|p=123}} Despite Finnish resistance, a peace treaty was signed in March 1940, wherein Finland ceded some key territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]]. After this war, Finland sought protection and support from the United Kingdom{{sfn|Seppinen|1983|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}<ref name=\"FOFinland\">British Foreign Office Archive, 371/24809/461-556.</ref> and non-aligned Sweden,{{sfn|Jokipii|1987|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} but was thwarted by Soviet and German actions. This resulted in Finland being drawn closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories.\n\nIn the opening days of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Finland permitted German planes returning from mine dropping runs over [[Kronstadt]] and [[Neva River]] to refuel at Finnish airfields before returning to bases in [[East Prussia]]. In retaliation, the Soviet Union launched a major air offensive against Finnish airfields and towns, which resulted in a Finnish declaration of war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941. The Finnish conflict with the Soviet Union is generally referred to as the [[Continuation War]].\n\n[[File:Hitler Mannerheim 2.jpg|upright|thumb| [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]] with Hitler]]\nFinland's main objective was to regain territory lost to the Soviet Union in the Winter War. However, on 10 July 1941, Field Marshal [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] issued an [[Order of the Day]] that contained a formulation understood internationally as a Finnish territorial interest in Russian [[Karelia]].\n\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Finland were severed on 1 August 1941, after the British bombed German forces in the Finnish village and port of [[Pechenga (urban-type settlement), Murmansk Oblast|Petsamo]]. The United Kingdom repeatedly called on Finland to cease its offensive against the Soviet Union, and declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]].\n[[File:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish troops passing by the remains of a destroyed Soviet T-34 at the [[battle of Tali-Ihantala]]]]\nFinland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany. Germans and Finns did work closely together during [[Operation Silverfox]], a joint offensive against Murmansk. Finland refused German requests to participate actively in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and also granted asylum to Jews, while Jewish soldiers continued to serve in its army.\n\nThe relationship between Finland and Germany more closely resembled an alliance during the six weeks of the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was presented as a German condition for help with munitions and air support, as the [[Fourth strategic offensive|Soviet offensive coordinated with D-Day]] threatened Finland with complete occupation. The agreement, signed by President [[Risto Ryti]] but never ratified by the Finnish Parliament, bound Finland not to seek a separate peace.\n\nAfter Soviet offensives were fought to a standstill, Ryti's successor as president, Marshall Mannerheim, dismissed the agreement and opened secret negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in a ceasefire on 4 September and the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. Under the terms of the armistice, Finland was obliged to expel German troops from Finnish territory, which resulted in the [[Lapland War]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.\n\n===Free City of Danzig===\n{{Main|Free City of Danzig}}\nThe [[Free City of Danzig]], a semi-autonomous city-state under League of Nations protection, briefly aided the Nazis at the beginning of the [[invasion of Poland]], attacking Polish territories bordering the city.

Seizing power on 1 April 1941, the nationalist government of [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Rashid Ali]] repudiated the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930]] and demanded that the British abandon their military bases and withdraw from the country. Ali sought support from Germany and Italy in expelling British forces from Iraq.\n\nOn 9 May 1941, [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] and associate of Ali, declared holy war{{sfn|Jab\u0101rah|1985|p=183}} against the British and called on Arabs throughout the Middle East to rise up against British rule. On 25 May 1941, the Germans stepped up offensive operations in the Middle East.\n\nHitler issued [[F\u00fchrer Directive No. 30|Order 30]]: \"The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England.

The Germans and Italians dispatched aircraft and aircrew to Iraq utilizing Vichy French bases in Syria, which would later invoke fighting between [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Allied and Vichy French forces in Syria]].\n\nThe Germans planned to coordinate a combined German-Italian offensive against the British in Egypt, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and Iraq. Iraqi military resistance ended by 31 May 1941. Rashid Ali and the Mufti of Jerusalem fled to Iran, then Turkey, Italy, and finally Germany, where Ali was welcomed by Hitler as head of the Iraqi [[government-in-exile]] in Berlin. In propaganda broadcasts from Berlin, the Mufti continued to call on Arabs to rise up against the British and aid German and Italian forces. He also helped recruit [[Muslim]] volunteers in the Balkans for the ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.\n\n===Thailand===\n{{See also|Thailand in World War II}}\n[[File:Plaek Pibulsonggram said Chulalongkorn university student on 8 October 1940.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] gave [[ultranationalist]] speech to the crowds at the [[Grand Palace]] in 1940.]]\n\n[[Thailand]] waged the [[Franco-Thai War]] in October 1940 to May 1941 to reclaim territory from [[French Indochina]]. It became a formal ally of Japan from 25 January 1942. Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invaded Thailand's territory]] an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor (because of the International Dateline, the local time was on the morning of 8 December 1941). Only hours after the invasion, Prime Minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] ordered the cessation of resistance against the Japanese. On 21 December 1941, a military alliance with Japan was signed and on 25 January 1942, [[Sang Phathanothai]] read over the radio Thailand's formal declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thai ambassador to the United States, [[Mom Rajawongse]] [[Seni Pramoj]], did not deliver his copy of the declaration of war. Therefore, although the British reciprocated by declaring war on Thailand and considered it a hostile country, the United States did not.\n\nThe Thais and Japanese agreed that [[Shan State]] and [[Kayah State]] were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control. On 10 May 1942, the Thai [[Phayap Army]] entered Burma's eastern Shan State, which had been claimed by Siamese kingdoms. Three Thai infantry and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the air force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. [[Kengtung]], the main objective, was captured on 27 May. Renewed offensives in June and November saw the Chinese retreat into [[Yunnan]].<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027105102/http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |archivedate=2009-10-27|url=http://geocities.com/thailandwwii/shans.html |title=Thailand and the Second World War }}</ref> The area containing the Shan States and Kayah State was annexed by Thailand in 1942. The areas were ceded back to [[Burma]] in 1945.\n\nThe [[Free Thai Movement]] (\"Seri Thai\") was established during these first few months. Parallel Free Thai organizations were also established in the United Kingdom. Queen [[Rambai Barni]] was the nominal head of the British-based organization, and [[Pridi Banomyong]], the regent, headed its largest contingent, which was operating within Thailand. Aided by elements of the military, secret airfields and training camps were established, while [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[Force 136]] agents slipped in and out of the country.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the Thai population came to resent the Japanese presence. In June 1944, Phibun was overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat. The new civilian government under [[Khuang Aphaiwong]] attempted to aid the resistance while maintaining cordial relations with the Japanese. After the war, U. S. influence prevented Thailand from being treated as an Axis country, but the British demanded three million tons of rice as reparations and the return of areas annexed from [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the war. Thailand also returned the portions of British Burma and French Indochina that had been annexed. Phibun and a number of his associates were put on trial on charges of having committed war crimes and of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, the charges were dropped due to intense public pressure. Public opinion was favorable to Phibun, as he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests.\n\n==Client states==\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n\n===German===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nThe collaborationist administrations of German-occupied countries in Europe had varying degrees of autonomy, and not all of them qualified as fully recognized [[sovereign state]]s. The [[General Government]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]] was a German administration, not a Polish government. In [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]], the [[Quisling regime|National Government]] headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] \u2013 whose name [[Quisling|came to symbolize pro-Axis collaboration]] in several languages \u2013 was subordinate to the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. It was never allowed to have any armed forces, be a recognized military partner, or have autonomy of any kind. In [[History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)|the occupied Netherlands]], [[Anton Mussert]] was given the symbolic title of \"F\u00fchrer of the Netherlands' people\". His [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]] formed a cabinet assisting the German administration, but was never recognized as a real Dutch government. The following list of German client states includes only those entities that were officially{{who|date=March 2020}} considered to be independent countries allied with Germany. They were under varying degrees of German influence and control, but were not ruled directly by Germans.\n\n====Albania (under German control)====\n{{Main|Albanian Kingdom (1943\u20131944)}}\nAfter the Italian armistice, a vacuum of power opened up in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]]. The Italian occupying forces were rendered largely powerless, as the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] took control of the south and the National Front ([[Balli Komb\u00ebtar]]) took control of the north. Albanians in the Italian army joined the guerrilla forces. In September 1943 the guerrillas moved to take the capital of [[Tirana]], but German paratroopers dropped into the city. Soon after the battle, the German High Command announced that they would recognize the independence of a [[greater Albania]]. They organized an Albanian government, police, and military in collaboration with the Balli Komb\u00ebtar. The Germans did not exert heavy control over Albania's administration, but instead attempted to gain popular appeal by giving their political partners what they wanted. Several Balli Komb\u00ebtar leaders held positions in the regime. The joint forces incorporated Kosovo, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, and Presevo into the Albanian state. A High Council of Regency was created to carry out the functions of a head of state, while the government was headed mainly by Albanian conservative politicians. Albania was the only European country occupied by the Axis powers that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the war.{{sfn|Sarner|1997|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}} The Albanian government had refused to hand over their Jewish population.

The Government of National Salvation was evacuated from Belgrade to [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in the first week of October 1944 before the German withdrawal from Serbia was complete.\n\nRacial laws were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on Jews and Roma people, as well as causing the imprisonment of those opposed to Nazism. Several concentration camps were formed in Serbia and at the 1942 Anti-Freemason Exhibition in Belgrade the city was pronounced to be free of Jews (Judenfrei). On 1 April 1942, a Serbian Gestapo was formed. An estimated 120,000 people were interned in German-run concentration camps in Nedi\u0107's Serbia between 1941 and 1944. 50,000 to 80,000 were killed during this period. Serbia became the second country in Europe, following Estonia, to be proclaimed Judenfrei (free of Jews). Approximately 14,500 Serbian Jews \u2013 90 percent of Serbia's Jewish population of 16,000 \u2013 were murdered in World War II.\n\nCollaborationist armed formations forces were involved, either directly or indirectly, in the mass killings of Jews, Roma and those Serbs who sided with any anti-German resistance or were suspects of being a member of such. These forces were also responsible for the killings of many Croats and Muslims; however, some Croats who took refuge in Nedi\u0107's Serbia were not discriminated against. After the war, the Serbian involvement in many of these events and the issue of Serbian collaboration were subject to historical revisionism by later public figures.\n\nNedi\u0107 himself was captured by the Americans when they occupied the former territory of Austria, and was subsequently handed over to the Yugoslav communist authorities to act as a witness against war criminals, on the understanding he would be returned to American custody to face trial by the Allies. The Yugoslav authorities refused to return Nedi\u0107 to United States custody. He died on 4 February 1946 after either jumping or falling out of the window of a Belgrade hospital, under circumstances which remain unclear.\n\n====Italy (Italian Social Republic)====\n{{Main|Italian Social Republic}}\n[[File:Italian social republic map.png|thumb|Italian Social Republic]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-311-0926-07, Italien, italienische Soldaten.jpg|thumb|left|RSI ([[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica Sociale Italiana]]) soldiers, March 1944]]\n\nItalian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] formed the Italian Social Republic (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) on 23 September 1943, succeeding the Kingdom of Italy as a member of the Axis.\n\nMussolini had been removed from office and arrested by King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July 1943. After the Italian armistice, in a [[Gran Sasso raid|raid]] led by German paratrooper [[Otto Skorzeny]], Mussolini was rescued from arrest.\n\nOnce restored to power, Mussolini declared that Italy was a [[republic]] and that he was the new head of state. He was subject to German control for the duration of the war.\n\n====Slovakia (Tiso regime)====\n{{Main|Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n[[File:Slovakia1941 02.png|thumb|Slovakia in 1941]]\nThe [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] under President [[Josef Tiso]] signed the Tripartite Pact on 24 November 1940.\n\nSlovakia had been closely aligned with Germany almost immediately from its declaration of independence from Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939. Slovakia entered into a treaty of protection with Germany on 23 March 1939.\n\nSlovak troops joined the German invasion of Poland, having interest in [[Spi\u0161]] and [[Orava (region)|Orava]]. Those two regions, along with [[Cieszyn Silesia]], had been [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts|disputed]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia since 1918. The Poles fully annexed them following the [[Munich Agreement]]. After the invasion of Poland, Slovakia reclaimed control of those territories.\n[[File:Andrzeja Olejko S\u0142owackie epizody z polskiego Podkarpacia Sanok 39.jpg|thumb|Slovak troops led by General [[Ferdinand \u010catlo\u0161]] (center) pose with a statue of [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] in [[Sanok]] during the Invasion of Poland.]]\nSlovakia invaded Poland alongside German forces, contributing 50,000 men at this stage of the war.\n\nSlovakia declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941 and signed the revived Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941. Slovak troops fought on Germany's Eastern Front, furnishing Germany with two divisions totaling 80,000 men. Slovakia declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in 1942.\n\nSlovakia was spared German military occupation until the [[Slovak National Uprising]], which began on 29 August 1944, and was almost immediately crushed by the Waffen SS and Slovak troops loyal to Josef Tiso.\n\nAfter the war, Tiso was executed and Slovakia once again became part of Czechoslovakia. The border with Poland was shifted back to the pre-war state. Slovakia and the Czech Republic finally separated into independent states in 1993.\n\n===Italian===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\nItaly occupied several nations and set up clients in those regions to carry out administrative tasks and maintain order.\n\n====Monaco====\nThe [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] was officially neutral during the war. The population of the country was largely of Italian descent and sympathized with Italy. Its prince was a close friend of the Vichy French leader, Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, an Axis collaborator. A fascist regime was established under the nominal rule of the prince when the Italian Fourth Army occupied the country on November 10, 1942 as a part of [[Case Anton]]. Monaco's military forces, consisting primarily of police and palace guards, collaborated with the Italians during the occupation.

The NDH remained a member of the Axis until the end of Second World War, its forces fighting for Germany even after its territory had been overrun by [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. On 16 April 1941, [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], a Croatian nationalist and one of the founders of the [[Usta\u0161e]] (''\"Croatian Liberation Movement\"''), was proclaimed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of the new regime.\n\nInitially the Usta\u0161e had been heavily influenced by Italy. They were actively supported by Mussolini's Fascist regime in Italy, which gave the movement training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia, as well as accepting Paveli\u0107 as an exile and allowing him to reside in Rome. Italy intended to use the movement to destroy Yugoslavia, which would allow Italy to expand its power through the Adriatic. Hitler did not want to engage in a war in the Balkans until the Soviet Union was defeated. The Italian occupation of Greece was not going well; Mussolini wanted Germany to invade Yugoslavia to save the Italian forces in Greece. Hitler reluctantly agreed; Yugoslavia was invaded and the Independent State of Croatia was created. Paveli\u0107 led a delegation to Rome and offered the crown of Croatia to an Italian prince of the House of Savoy, who was crowned ''[[Tomislav II]], King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, [[Tuzla]] and Knin, Prince of [[Cisterna]] and of Belriguardo, Marquess of [[Voghera]], and Count of [[Ponderano]].'' The next day, Paveli\u0107 signed the Contracts of Rome with Mussolini, ceding Dalmatia to Italy and fixing the permanent borders between the NDH and Italy. Italian armed forces were allowed to control all of the coastline of the NDH, effectively giving Italy total control of the Adriatic coastline.\n\nHowever, strong German influence began to be asserted soon after the NDH was founded. When the King of Italy ousted Mussolini from power and Italy capitulated, the NDH became completely under German influence.\n\nThe platform of the Usta\u0161e movement proclaimed that Croatians had been oppressed by the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and that Croatians deserved to have an independent nation after years of domination by foreign empires. The Usta\u0161e perceived Serbs to be racially inferior to Croats and saw them as infiltrators who were occupying Croatian lands. They saw the extermination of Serbs as necessary to racially purify Croatia. While part of Yugoslavia, many Croatian nationalists violently opposed the Serb-dominated Yugoslav monarchy, and assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]], together with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]. The regime enjoyed support amongst radical Croatian nationalists. Ustashe forces fought against communist Yugoslav Partisan guerrilla throughout the war.\n\nUpon coming to power, Paveli\u0107 formed the Croatian Home Guard (''Hrvatsko domobranstvo'') as the official military force of the NDH. Originally authorized at 16,000 men, it grew to a peak fighting force of 130,000. The Croatian Home Guard included an air force and navy, although its navy was restricted in size by the Contracts of Rome. In addition to the Croatian Home Guard, Paveli\u0107 was also the supreme commander of the [[Usta\u0161e militia]], although all NDH military units were generally under the command of the German or Italian formations in their area of operations.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government declared war on the Soviet Union, signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941, and sent troops to Germany's Eastern Front. Usta\u0161e militia were garrisoned in the Balkans, battling the communist partisans.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e government applied racial laws on Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people]], as well as targeting those opposed to the fascist regime, and after June 1941 deported them to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] or to German camps in Poland. The racial laws were enforced by the Usta\u0161e militia. The exact number of victims of the Usta\u0161e regime is uncertain due to the destruction of documents and varying numbers given by historians. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH.<ref name=\"US Holocaust Memorial Museum\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711191159/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005449 Jasenovac] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site</ref>\n\n====Greece (Hellenic State)====\n{{Main|Axis occupation of Greece|Hellenic State (1941\u20131944)}}\n[[File:Greece Prefectures 1941-44.png|thumb|Greece, 1941\u20131944]]\nFollowing the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]] of Greece and the flight of the [[Greek government in exile|Greek government]] to Crete and then Egypt, the [[Hellenic State (1941-1944)|Hellenic State]] was formed in May 1941 as a puppet state of both Italy and Germany. Initially, Italy had wished to annex Greece, but was pressured by Germany to avoid civil unrest such as had occurred in Bulgarian-annexed areas. The result was Italy accepting the creation of a puppet regime with the support of Germany. Italy had been assured by Hitler of a primary role in Greece. Most of the country was held by Italian forces, but strategic locations ([[Central Macedonia]], the islands of the northeastern Aegean, most of [[Crete]], and parts of [[Attica]]) were held by the Germans, who seized most of the country's economic assets and effectively controlled the collaborationist government. The puppet regime never commanded any real authority, and did not gain the allegiance of the people. It was somewhat successful in preventing secessionist movements like the [[Vlach \"Roman Legion\"]] from establishing themselves. By mid-1943, the [[Greek Resistance]] had liberated large parts of the mountainous interior (\"Free Greece\"), setting up a separate administration there. After the Italian armistice, the Italian occupation zone was taken over by the German armed forces, who remained in charge of the country until their withdrawal in autumn 1944. In some Aegean islands, German garrisons were left behind, and surrendered only after the end of the war.\n\n===Japanese===\n<!-- Client states section should include only states that were officially independent countries, and not simply local administrations of occupied territories. -->\n{{further|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\nThe Empire of Japan created a number of client states in the areas occupied by its military, beginning with the creation of Manchukuo in 1932. These puppet states achieved varying degrees of international recognition.\n\n====Burma (Ba Maw regime)====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Burma|State of Burma|Burma National Army}}\nThe Japanese Army and Burma nationalists, led by [[Aung San]], seized control of Burma from the United Kingdom during 1942. A [[State of Burma]] was formed on 1 August under the Burmese nationalist leader [[Ba Maw]]. The Ba Maw regime established the Burma Defence Army (later renamed the [[Burma National Army]]), which was commanded by [[Aung San]].\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Cambodia}}\nThe [[Colonial Cambodia#Emergence of Khmer nationalism|Kingdom of Cambodia]] was a short-lived Japanese puppet state that lasted from 9 March 1945 to 15 August 1945.\n\nThe Japanese entered Cambodia in mid-1941, but allowed Vichy French officials to remain in administrative posts. The Japanese calls for an \"Asia for the Asiatics\" won over many Cambodian nationalists.\n\nThis policy changed during the last months of the war. The Japanese wanted to gain local support, so they dissolved French colonial rule and pressured Cambodia to declare its independence within the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Four days later, King [[Norodom Sihanouk|Sihanouk]] declared Kampuchea (the original [[Khmer language|Khmer]] pronunciation of Cambodia) independent. Co-editor of the ''Nagaravatta'', [[Son Ngoc Thanh]], returned from Tokyo in May and was appointed foreign minister.\n\nOn the date of Japanese surrender, a new government was proclaimed with Son Ngoc Thanh as prime minister. When the Allies occupied [[Phnom Penh]] in October, Son Ngoc Thanh was arrested for collaborating with the Japanese and was exiled to France. Some of his supporters went to northwestern Cambodia, which had been under Thai control since the [[French-Thai War]] of 1940, where they banded together as one faction in the [[Khmer Issarak]] movement, originally formed with Thai encouragement in the 1940s.\n\n====China (Reorganized National Government of China)====\n{{Main|Wang Jingwei regime}}\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Japan advanced from its bases in Manchuria to occupy much of East and Central China. Several Japanese puppet states were organized in areas occupied by the Japanese Army, including the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1937\u20131940)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] at [[Beijing]], which was formed in 1937, and the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] at Nanjing, which was formed in 1938. These governments were merged into the [[Reorganized National Government of China]] at Nanjing on 29 March 1940. [[Wang Jingwei]] became head of state. The government was to be run along the same lines as the Nationalist regime and adopted its symbols.\n\nThe Nanjing Government had no real power; its main role was to act as a propaganda tool for the Japanese. The Nanjing Government concluded agreements with Japan and Manchukuo, authorising Japanese occupation of China and recognising the independence of Manchukuo under Japanese protection. The Nanjing Government signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 and declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 9 January 1943.\n\nThe government had a strained relationship with the Japanese from the beginning. Wang's insistence on his regime being the true Nationalist government of China and in replicating all the symbols of the [[Kuomintang]] led to frequent conflicts with the Japanese, the most prominent being the issue of the regime's flag, which was identical to that of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\nThe worsening situation for Japan from 1943 onwards meant that the Nanking Army was given a more substantial role in the defence of occupied China than the Japanese had initially envisaged. The army was almost continuously employed against the communist [[New Fourth Army]].\n\nWang Jingwei died on 10 November 1944, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Chen Gongbo]]. Chen had little influence; the real power behind the regime was [[Zhou Fohai]], the mayor of Shanghai. Wang's death dispelled what little legitimacy the regime had. The state stuttered on for another year and continued the display and show of a fascist regime.\n\nOn 9 September 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the area was surrendered to General [[He Yingqin]], a nationalist general loyal to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. The Nanking Army generals quickly declared their alliance to the Generalissimo, and were subsequently ordered to resist Communist attempts to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese surrender. Chen Gongbo was tried and executed in 1946.\n\n====India (Provisional Government of Free India)====\n{{Main|Azad Hind Fauj|Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:INA Jubilation.jpg|thumb|[[Indian National Army]] soldiers in Asia]] -->\n\nThe ''Arzi Hukumat-e-[[Azad Hind]]'', the Provisional Government of Free India was a state that was recognized by nine Axis governments. It was led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], an [[Indian nationalist]] who rejected [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s nonviolent methods for achieving independence. The [[First INA]] faltered after its leadership objected to being a propaganda tool for Japanese war aims, and the role of [[I Kikan]]. It was revived by the [[Indian Independence League]] with Japanese support in 1942 after the ex-PoWs and Indian civilians in South-east Asia agreed to participate in the INA venture on the condition it was led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]. Bose declared India's independence on October 21, 1943. The Indian National Army was committed as a part of the [[U Go Offensive]]. It played a largely marginal role in the battle, and suffered serious casualties and had to withdraw with the rest of Japanese forces after the [[Battle of Imphal|siege of Imphal]] was broken. It was later committed to the defence of Burma [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|against the Allied offensive]]. It suffered a large number of desertions in this latter part. The remaining troops of the INA maintained order in Rangoon after the withdrawal of Ba Maw's government. although The provisional government was given nominal control of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] from November 1943 to August 1945.\n\n====Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang)====\n{{Main|Mengjiang}}\n[[Mengjiang]] was a Japanese puppet state in [[Inner Mongolia]]. It was nominally ruled by Prince [[Demchugdongrub]], a [[Mongol]] nobleman descended from [[Genghis Khan]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military. Mengjiang's independence was proclaimed on 18 February 1936, following the Japanese occupation of the region.\n\nThe Inner Mongolians had several grievances against the central Chinese government in Nanking, including their policy of allowing unlimited migration of Han Chinese to the region. Several of the young princes of Inner Mongolia began to agitate for greater freedom from the central government, and it was through these men that Japanese saw their best chance of exploiting Pan-Mongol nationalism and eventually seizing control of Outer Mongolia from the Soviet Union.\n\nJapan created Mengjiang to exploit tensions between ethnic Mongolians and the central government of China, which in theory ruled Inner Mongolia. When the various puppet governments of China were unified under the [[Wang Jingwei]] government in March 1940, Mengjiang retained its separate identity as an autonomous federation. Although under the firm control of the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied its territory, Prince Demchugdongrub had his own independent army.\n\nMengjiang vanished in 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II. As Soviet forces advanced into Inner Mongolia, they met limited resistance from small detachments of Mongolian cavalry, which, like the rest of the army, were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n====Laos====\n{{Main|French Protectorate of Laos#Japanese occupation of Laos}}\nFears of Thai irredentism led to the formation of the first Lao nationalist organization, the Movement for National Renovation, in January 1941. The group was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetxar\u0101t]] and supported by local French officials, though not by the Vichy authorities in [[Hanoi]]. This group wrote the current [[Pheng Xat Lao|Lao national anthem]] and designed the current [[Flag of Laos|Lao flag]], while paradoxically pledging support for France. The country declared its independence in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of France in 1944, bringing [[Charles de Gaulle]] to power, meant the end of the alliance between Japan and the Vichy French administration in Indochina. The Japanese had no intention of allowing the [[Gaullist]]s to take over, and in March 1945 they staged a military coup in Hanoi. Some French units fled over the mountains to Laos, pursued by the Japanese, who occupied [[Vientiane|Viang Chan]] in March 1945 and [[Luang Prabang|Luang Phrab\u0101ng]] in April. King [[Sisavang Vong|S\u012bsav\u0101ngvong]] was detained by the Japanese, but his son Crown Prince [[Savang Vatthana|Sav\u0101ngvatthan\u0101]] called on all [[Lao people|Lao]] to assist the French, and many Lao died fighting against the Japanese occupiers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nPrince Phetxar\u0101t opposed this position. He thought that Lao independence could be gained by siding with the Japanese, who made him Prime Minister of Luang Phrab\u0101ng, though not of Laos as a whole. The country was in chaos, and Phetxar\u0101t's government had no real authority. Another Lao group, the Lao S\u0113ri (Free Lao), received unofficial support from the Free Thai movement in the [[Isan]] region.\n\n====Manchuria (Manchukuo)====\n{{Main|Manchukuo}}\n[[File:Military exercise of Manchukuo Imperial Army.JPG|thumb|Manchurian soldiers training in a military exercise]]\n[[File:Manchukuo Air Force.JPG|thumb|Manchurian pilots of the Manchukuo Air Force]]\n\nManchukuo, in the northeast region of China, had been a Japanese puppet state in [[Manchuria]] since the 1930s. It was nominally ruled by [[Puyi]], the last emperor of the [[Qing Dynasty]], but was in fact controlled by the Japanese military, in particular the [[Kwantung Army]]. While Manchukuo ostensibly was a state for ethnic [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the region had a [[Han Chinese]] majority.\n\nFollowing the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, the independence of Manchukuo was proclaimed on 18 February 1932, with Puyi as head of state. He was proclaimed the Emperor of Manchukuo a year later. The new Manchu nation was recognized by 23 of the [[League of Nations]]' 80 members. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were among the major powers who recognised Manchukuo. Other countries who recognized the State were the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Vatican City]]. Manchukuo was also recognised by the other Japanese allies and puppet states, including Mengjiang, the Burmese government of [[Ba Maw]], [[Thailand]], the Wang Jingwei regime, and the Indian government of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The League of Nations later declared in 1934 that Manchuria lawfully remained a part of China. This precipitated Japanese withdrawal from the League. The Manchukuoan state ceased to exist after the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in 1945.\n\n====Philippines (Second Republic)====\n{{main|Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Second Philippine Republic}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Bataan#The Fall of Bataan|surrender]] of the Filipino and American forces in [[Bataan Peninsula]] and [[Corregidor Island]], the Japanese established a puppet state in the Philippines in 1942.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guillermo |first=Artemio R. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&lpg=PA211&dq=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q=Support%20Second%20Republic%20Philippines&f=false |accessdate=22 March 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7246-2 |pages=211, 621}}</ref> The following year, the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|Philippine National Assembly]] declared the Philippines an [[Second Philippine Republic|independent Republic]] and elected [[Jos\u00e9 P.

This French rule ended on 9 March 1945, when the Japanese officially took control of the government. Soon after, Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]] voided the 1884 treaty with France and [[Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim]], a historian, became prime minister.\n\nThe country suffered through the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]].\n\n==Controversial cases==\n{{See also|Foreign relations of the Axis powers}}\n\nStates listed in this section were not officially members of the Axis, but at some point during the war engaged in cooperation with one or more Axis members on level that makes their neutrality disputable.\n\n===Denmark===\n{{Main|Occupation of Denmark }}\n[[File:Flag of Denmark.svg|thumb|[[Kingdom of Denmark]]]]\n\nDenmark was occupied by Germany after April 1940 but never joined the Axis.

In the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Soviet Union gave military aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic]], against [[Spanish State|Spanish Nationalist]] forces, which were assisted by Germany and Italy. However, the Nationalist forces were victorious. The Soviets suffered another political defeat when their ally Czechoslovakia was partitioned and taken over by Germany in 1938\u201339. In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border conflicts, at [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan]] and [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. The latter was a major Soviet victory that led the Japanese Army to avoid war with the Soviets and instead call for expansion south.\n\nIn 1939 the Soviet Union considered forming an alliance with either [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Britain and France]] or with Germany.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=112\u2013120}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=495\u2013496}} When negotiations with Britain and France failed, they turned to Germany and signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Germany was now freed from the risk of war with the Soviets, and was assured a supply of oil. This included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Romania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties.{{sfn|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939}} The Soviet Union had been forced to cede the [[Kresy]] (Western [[Belarus]] and Western [[Ukraine]]) to Poland after losing the [[Soviet-Polish War]] of 1919\u20131921, and the Soviet Union sought to re-annex those territories.<ref name=\"Eastern Europe 2004, Pp. 138-139\"/>\n\nOn 1 September, barely a week after the pact had been signed, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]].

These and other export goods transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories allowed Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade.\n\nIn October and November 1940, [[German\u2013Soviet Axis talks|German-Soviet talks]] about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=58}}{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}} [[Joseph Stalin]] later personally countered with a separate proposal in a letter on 25 November that contained several secret protocols, including that \"the area south of [[Batum]] and [[Baku]] in the general direction of the [[Persian Gulf]] is recognized as the center of aspirations of the Soviet Union\", referring to an area approximating present day Iraq and Iran, and a Soviet claim to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341\u2013343}}{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}} Hitler never responded to Stalin's letter.{{sfn|Donaldson|Nogee|2005|pp=65\u201366}}{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=520\u2013521}} Shortly thereafter, Hitler issued a secret directive on the invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202\u2013205}}{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}}\n\nGermany ended the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=82}} That resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the main members of [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].\n\nGermany then revived its Anti-Comintern Pact, enlisting many European and Asian countries in opposition to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war by the [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]]. The Soviet Union ended the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|by invading Manchukuo]] on 9 August 1945, due to agreements reached at the [[Yalta Conference]] with Roosevelt and Churchill.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Spain in World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg|thumb|Front row in order from left to right: [[Karl Wolff]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Francisco Franco]] and Spain's Foreign Minister [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er|Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]] in Madrid, October 1940.]]\n[[File:Franco-Mussolini-Serrano-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Franco]] (centre) and Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er (left) meeting with Mussolini (right) in [[Bordighera]], Italy in 1941.

Franco described Spain as a member of the Axis and signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] in 1941 with Hitler and Mussolini. Members of the ruling [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola y de las JONS|Falange]] party in Spain held irredentist designs on [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Wylie|2002|p=275}} Falangists also supported Spanish colonial acquisition of [[Tangier]], [[French Morocco]] and northwestern [[French Algeria]].{{sfn|Rohr|2007|p=99}} In addition, Spain held ambitions on former Spanish colonies in Latin America.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} In June 1940 the Spanish government approached Germany to propose an alliance in exchange for Germany recognizing Spain's territorial aims: the annexation of the [[Oran]] province of [[Algeria]], the incorporation of all [[Morocco]], the extension of [[Spanish Sahara]] southward to the twentieth parallel, and the incorporation of [[French Cameroons]] into [[Spanish Guinea]].{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} Spain invaded and occupied the [[Tangier]] International Zone, maintaining its occupation until 1945.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The occupation caused a dispute between Britain and Spain in November 1940; Spain conceded to protect British rights in the area and promised not to fortify the area.{{sfn|Payne|1987|p=269}} The Spanish government secretly held expansionist plans towards Portugal that it made known to the German government. In a communiqu\u00e9 with Germany on 26 May 1942, Franco declared that Portugal should be annexed into Spain.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=857}}\n\nFranco had previously won the [[Spanish Civil War]] with the help of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Both were eager to establish another fascist state in Europe.

This was accepted by Hitler and, within two weeks, there were more than enough volunteers to form a division \u2013 the [[Blue Division]] (''Divisi\u00f3n Azul'') under General [[Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes]].\n\nThe possibility of Spanish intervention in World War II was of concern to the United States, which investigated the activities of Spain's ruling Falange party in Latin America, especially [[Puerto Rico]], where pro-Falange and pro-Franco sentiment was high, even amongst the ruling upper classes.{{sfn|Leonard|Bratzel|2007|p=96}} The Falangists promoted the idea of supporting Spain's former colonies in fighting against American domination.{{sfn|Bowen|2000|p=59}} Prior to the outbreak of war, support for Franco and the Falange was high in the Philippines.{{sfn|Steinberg|2000|p=122}} The [[Falange Exterior]], the international department of the Falange, collaborated with Japanese forces against U.S. and Filipino forces in the [[Philippines]] through the [[Philippine Falange]].{{sfn|Payne|1999|p=538}}\n\n===Vichy France===\n{{main|Vichy France}}\n[[File:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation.svg|thumb|France during the war; [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupied and annexed zones by Germany]] in shades of red, [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|Italian occupation zones]] in shades of green and striped blue, [[zone libre|\"Free zone\"]] in blue.]]\n\nAlthough officially neutral, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France|\"Vichy regime\"]] collaborated with the Axis from its creation on 10 July 1940. It retained full control of the [[zone libre|non-occupied part of France]] until November 1942, and a large part of France's [[French colonial empire|colonial empire]], until the colonies gradually fell under [[Free French]] control.\n\nThe German invasion army entered Paris on 14 June 1940, following the [[battle of France]]. P\u00e9tain became the last Prime Minister of the [[French Third Republic]] on 16 June 1940. He sued for peace with Germany and on 22 June 1940, the French government [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|concluded an armistice]] with Hitler and Mussolini, which came into effect at midnight on 25 June. Under the terms of the agreement, Germany [[occupied France|occupied two-thirds]] of France, including Paris. P\u00e9tain was permitted to keep an \"armistice army\" of 100,000 men within the unoccupied southern zone. This number included neither the army based in the [[French colonial empire]] nor the French fleet. In Africa the Vichy regime was permitted to maintain 127,000.{{sfn|Bachelier|2000|p=98}} The French also maintained substantial garrisons at the French-mandated territory of [[Syrian Republic (1930-1958)|Syria]] and [[Greater Lebanon]], the French colony of [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]], and in [[French Somaliland]]. Some members of the Vichy government pushed for closer cooperation, but they were rebuffed by P\u00e9tain. Neither did Hitler accept that France could ever become a full military partner,{{sfn|Paxton|1993}} and constantly prevented the buildup of Vichy's military strength.\n\nAfter the armistice, relations between the Vichy French and the British quickly worsened. Although the French had told Churchill they would not allow their fleet to be taken by the Germans, the British launched several naval attacks, the most notable of which was against [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|the Algerian harbour of Mers el-Kebir]] on 3 July 1940. Though Churchill defended his controversial decision to attack the French fleet, the action deteriorated greatly the relations between France and Britain. German propaganda trumpeted these attacks as an absolute betrayal of the French people by their former allies.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] (left) meeting with Hitler in October 1940.]]\n[[File:Flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|Personal flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of [[Vichy France]].]]\nOn 10 July 1940, P\u00e9tain was given emergency \"full powers\" by a majority vote of the [[French National Assembly]]. The following day approval of the new constitution by the Assembly effectively created the [[French State]] (''l'\u00c9tat Fran\u00e7ais''), replacing the French Republic with the government unofficially called \"Vichy France,\" after the resort town of [[Vichy]], where P\u00e9tain maintained his seat of government. This continued to be recognised as the lawful government of France by the neutral United States until 1942, while the United Kingdom had recognised [[Free France|de Gaulle's government-in-exile in London]]. Racial laws were introduced in France and its colonies and many [[History of the Jews in France|foreign Jews in France]] were deported to Germany. [[Albert Lebrun]], last President of the Republic, did not resign from the presidential office when he moved to [[Vizille]] on 10 July 1940. By 25 April 1945, during P\u00e9tain's trial, Lebrun argued that he thought he would be able to return to power after the fall of Germany, since he had not resigned.<ref>[http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html Albert Lebrun's biography, French Republic Presidential official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414173559/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_archives/la_presidence/la_galerie_des_presidents/iii_eme_republique/albert_lebrun.21008.html |date=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1940, Vichy France [[invasion of French Indochina|was forced to allow Japan to occupy French Indochina]], a federation of French colonial possessions and protectorates encompassing modern day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vichy regime continued to administer them under Japanese military occupation. [[French Indochina]] was the base for the Japanese [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|invasions of Thailand]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]], and [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]]. In 1945, [[geacps|under Japanese sponsorship]], the [[Empire of Vietnam]] and the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia#Collaborationist Kingdom of Kampuchea|Kingdom of Kampuchea]] were proclaimed as Japanese puppet states.\n\nOn 26 September 1940, de Gaulle [[Battle of Dakar|led an attack by Allied forces on the Vichy port of Dakar]] in [[French West Africa]]. Forces loyal to P\u00e9tain fired on de Gaulle and repulsed the attack after two days of heavy fighting, drawing Vichy France closer to Germany.\n\nDuring the [[Anglo\u2013Iraqi War]] of May 1941, Vichy France allowed Germany and Italy to use air bases in the [[French mandate of Syria]] to support the Iraqi revolt. British and Free French forces attacked later [[Syria-Lebanon campaign|Syria and Lebanon in June\u2013July 1941]], and in 1942 Allied forces [[Battle of Madagascar|took over French Madagascar]]. More and more colonies abandoned Vichy, joining the Free French territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]], [[French Polynesia|Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]] and others who had sided with de Gaulle [[Appeal of 18 June|from the start]].\n\nIn November 1942 Vichy French troops briefly resisted the [[Operation Torch|landing of Allied troops in French North Africa]] for two days, until Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] negotiated a local ceasefire with the Allies. In response to the landings, [[Case Anton|Axis troops invaded]] the non-occupied zone in southern France and ended Vichy France as an entity with any kind of autonomy; it then became a puppet government for the occupied territories.\n\nIn June 1943, the formerly Vichy-loyal colonial authorities in [[French North Africa]] led by [[Henri Giraud]] came to an agreement with the [[Free French]] to merge with their own interim regime with the [[Free France#Creation of the French National Committee (CNF)|French National Committee]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais National'', CFN) to form a [[provisional government]] in [[Algiers]], known as the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (''Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale'', CFLN) initially led by Darlan. After his assassination De Gaulle emerged as the uncontested French leader. The CFLN raised more troops and re-organised, re-trained and re-equipped the Free French military, in cooperation with Allied forces in preparation of future operations [[Operation Husky|against Italy]] and the [[Operation Overlord|German Atlantic wall]].\n\nIn 1943 the [[Milice]], a paramilitary force which had been founded by Vichy, was subordinated to the Germans and assisted them in rounding up opponents and Jews, as well as fighting the [[French Resistance]]. The Germans recruited volunteers in units independent of Vichy. Partly as a result of the great animosity of many right-wingers against the pre-war [[Front Populaire]], volunteers joined the German forces in their anti-communist crusade against the USSR. Almost 7,000 joined ''[[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|L\u00e9gion des Volontaires Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (LVF) from 1941 to 1944. The LVF then formed the cadre of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|Waffen-SS Division ''Charlemagne'']] in 1944\u20131945, with a maximum strength of some 7,500. Both the LVF and the ''Division Charlemagne'' fought on the eastern front.\n\nDeprived of any military assets, territory or resources, the members of the Vichy government continued to fulfil their role as German puppets, being quasi-prisoners in the so-called \"[[Sigmaringen enclave]]\" in a castle in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg at the end of the war in May 1945.\n\n==German, Italian and Japanese World War II cooperation==\n===German-Japanese Axis-cooperation===\n{{Main|Germany\u2013Japan relations#Rapprochement, Axis and World War II (1920\u20131945)}}\n{{see also|Germany\u2013Japan industrial co-operation before World War II}}\n\n===Germany's and Italy's declaration of war against the United States===\nOn 7 December 1941, Japan [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the US naval bases in Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.

The commission formed to decide on the first recipient of the medal selected the German physicist [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] for his work on the science of [[spectroscopy]]. However, Kirchhoff died aged 63 on 17 October 1887, a few months before the award would have been announced. Rather than chose a new recipient for the award, the commission announced at the Academy's session of 26 December 1887 that the inaugural medal would be placed on his grave, in \"supreme honour of the memory of this great scholar of Heidelberg\".<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]]'' (1887), pp.1322\u20131323. The French phrase partially translated here is: ''\"L'Acad\u00e9mie voudra donner \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire du grand savant d'Heidelberg ce supr\u00eame hommage, qui sera une premi\u00e8re cons\u00e9cration de sa gloire et une consolation pour sa famille.\"''</ref>\n\nThe award had been intended to be biennial, but was awarded in 1888 and again in 1889. A statement in the 1889 volume of ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]]'' clarified that the award would be presented annually for the first seven years, and then biennially from 1894 onwards.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]]'' (1889), pp.1095\u20131096</ref>\n\nThis award is distinct from the [[Prix Jules Janssen]] (created in 1897), an annual award presented by the [[French Astronomical Society]]. Both awards are named for the French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen]] (1824\u20131907) (better known as Jules Janssen). Janssen founded the Academy award, and was a member of the inaugural commission.\n\n==Laureates==\n*1887 \u2013 [[Gustav Kirchhoff]]<ref name=\"Wilson\">[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1913PA.....21..377./0000383.000.html Prizes of the French Academy], Ralph E.

The commission formed to decide on the first recipient of the medal selected the German physicist [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] for his work on the science of [[spectroscopy]]. However, Kirchhoff died aged 63 on 17 October 1887, a few months before the award would have been announced. Rather than chose a new recipient for the award, the commission announced at the Academy's session of 26 December 1887 that the inaugural medal would be placed on his grave, in \"supreme honour of the memory of this great scholar of Heidelberg\".<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]]'' (1887), pp.1322-1323. The French phrase partially translated here is: ''\"L'Acad\u00e9mie voudra donner \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire du grand savant d'Heidelberg ce supr\u00eame hommage, qui sera une premi\u00e8re cons\u00e9cration de sa gloire et une consolation pour sa famille.\"''</ref>\n\nThe award had been intended to be biennial, but was awarded in 1888 and again in 1889. A statement in the 1889 volume of ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]]'' clarified that the award would be presented annually for the first seven years, and then biennially from 1894 onwards.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences]]'' (1889), pp.1095-1096</ref>\n\nThis award is distinct from the [[Prix Jules Janssen]] (created in 1897), an annual award presented by the [[French Astronomical Society]]. Both awards are named for the French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen]] (1824\u20131907) (better known as Jules Janssen).
