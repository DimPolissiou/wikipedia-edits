[[Colm \u00d3 Snodaigh]], the brother of R\u00f3n\u00e1n and Rossa, joined the band before the first recordings were made. R\u00f3n\u00e1n, Rossa, and Colm \u00d3 Snodaigh are sons of publisher [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Snodaigh]] and artist Cliodna Cussen and are brothers of Irish [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], [[Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Colm Mac Con Iomaire]] and Dave Odlum left K\u00edla to join [[The Frames]], an Irish rock band. In the same year, Dee Armstrong and Eoin O'Brien joined the band as replacements. Dave Reidy also joined as a lead guitarist, though he emigrated to San Francisco a year later. Karl was then replaced by Ed Kelly on bass who emigrated to Scotland a little over a year after the recording ''Mind the Gap'' in 1994. Eoin O'Brien was replaced by [[Lance Hogan]]. Laurence O Keefe filled in temporarily on bass until Brian Hogan assumed that position prior to recording ''T\u00f3g \u00c9 Go Bog \u00c9''.\n\nIn 2003, in a review of their album ''Luna Park'', K\u00edla's blend of Irish traditional music and world music with a modern rock sensibility was credited with breathing new life into contemporary Irish folk music.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/zrw6 bbc Kila Luna Park Review]</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Donegal guitarist Seanan Brennan joined the band to replace Lance who was on a sabbatical.

K\u00edla's music also features in the award-winning documentary film ''[[Fight or Flight (documentary)|Fight or Flight]]''.\n\nIn late 2011, K\u00edla published their long-awaited ''Book of Tunes''. Comprising over 100 of their compositions and lavishly decorated with photos, poems & prose, the book was a huge success, being described as 'a masterpiece' by Se\u00e1n Laffey from ''[[Irish Music Magazine]]''. The publication of the book ended a fine year for K\u00edla in style. Through this year they played three sell-out shows in Harare, Zimbabwe at the [[HIAFA]] festival, played at the [[Possibilities conference|Possibilities]] conference that welcomed the [[Dalai Lama]] to Ireland and played the inaugural concert in [[Temple Bar Meeting House Square]], under the elegant retractable canopies, two days before Christmas.\n\n2015 could be termed the 'year of the awards and nominations' for K\u00edla.

[[Colm \u00d3 Snodaigh]], the brother of R\u00f3n\u00e1n and Rossa, joined the band before the first recordings were made. R\u00f3n\u00e1n, Rossa, and Colm \u00d3 Snodaigh are sons of publisher [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Snodaigh]] and artist Cliodna Cussen and are brothers of Irish [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], [[Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Colm Mac Con Iomaire]] and Dave Odlum left K\u00edla to join [[The Frames]], an Irish rock band. In the same year, Dee Armstrong and Eoin O'Brien joined the band as replacements. Dave Reidy also joined as a lead guitarist, though he emigrated to San Francisco a year later. Karl was then replaced by Ed Kelly on bass who emigrated to Scotland a little over a year after the recording ''Mind the Gap'' in 1994. Eoin O'Brien was replaced by [[Lance Hogan]]. Laurence O Keefe filled in temporarily on bass until Brian Hogan assumed that position prior to recording ''T\u00f3g \u00c9 Go Bog \u00c9''.\n\nIn 2003, in a review of their album ''Luna Park'', K\u00edla's blend of Irish traditional music and world music with a modern rock sensibility was credited with breathing new life into contemporary Irish folk music.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/zrw6 bbc Kila Luna Park Review]</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Donegal guitarist Seanan Brennan joined the band to replace Lance who was on a sabbatical. He has remained with the band since then bringing an electric guitar to the line up for the first time since Eoin O'Brien was a member.

That same year their music was heavily featured in two other feature films - Maeve Murphy's controversial ''Beyond the Fire'' and Ciar\u00e1n O'Connor's ''[[Trafficked (film)|Trafficked]]''. K\u00edla's music also features in the award-winning documentary film ''[[Fight or Flight (documentary)|Fight or Flight]]''.\n\nIn late 2011, K\u00edla published their long-awaited ''Book of Tunes''. Comprising over 100 of their compositions and lavishly decorated with photos, poems & prose, the book was a huge success, being described as 'a masterpiece' by Se\u00e1n Laffey from ''[[Irish Music Magazine]]''. The publication of the book ended a fine year for K\u00edla in style. Through this year they played three sell-out shows in Harare, Zimbabwe at the [[HIAFA]] festival, played at the [[Possibilities conference|Possibilities]] conference that welcomed the [[Dalai Lama]] to Ireland and played the inaugural concert in [[Temple Bar Meeting House Square]], under the elegant retractable canopies, two days before Christmas.\n\n2015 could be termed the 'year of the awards and nominations' for K\u00edla. They collaborated on the music for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominated animated feature, [[Song of the Sea (2014 film)|Song of the Sea]] with [[Bruno Coulais]]. They received an [[Annie Awards]] nomination for 'Outstanding Achievement in Music in an Animated Feature Production'.

The force consists of Chief Randall Crawford, the violent Gina Jabowski, the overweight Dusty Marlow, the perverted senior citizen Stanley Hopson, the cowardly Gerald Fitzgerald, the addicted drug dog Bullet, and Crawford's son Kevin. The town is also home to many weird characters, including Crawford's ex-wife Karen, the hillbillies Robby and Delbert, Hobo Cop, Dr. Fudlicker, Preacher Paul, Terry Two-Toes and his mom. Continuing arcs of the show includes Jabowski's horniness over Dusty, Kevin's wish to impress his father, and the Crawfords' wish to get back together.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Netflix Orders Cop Animated Comedy Series From 'Brickleberry' Creators; Voice Cast Includes Tom Kenny & Sarah Chalke|url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/paradise-p-d-netflix-cop-animated-comedy-comedy-series-brickleberry-creators-voice-cast-tom-kenny-sarah-chalke-1202358417/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=April 4, 2018|date=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[David Herman]] as Kevin Pubesalad Crawford, a newly-hired police officer and the son of Chief Randall Crawford. As the series progresses, it is shown he is a capable and competent officer though he could be better if he had the proper equipment and funding for his work.\n* [[Tom Kenny]] as Chief Randall Crawford, the police chief of Paradise PD and Kevin's father. Once a fine and proud cop, following an incident where his son shot off both of his testicles, making him incredibly bitter over the next thirteen years, which eventually led to his divorce with his wife. He has to put on testosterone patches frequently in order to keep his masculinity in check.\n* [[Sarah Chalke]] as Gina Jabowski, a psychotic and violent police officer who often sexually harasses her obese coworker Dusty Marlow.  She does this because she has a [[Fat fetishism|fat fetish]] from a brain injury.\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Gerald \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald, a police officer whose [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] sometimes hinders his police work.\n* [[Dana Snyder]] as Dusty Marlow, an obese police officer who is constantly [[sexually harassed]] by Gina. He is very child-like and owns several cats.\n** Snyder also voices Stanley Hopson, an elderly [[bisexual]] police officer who often gets out-of-the-ordinary assignments from Chief Crawford. Even at his advanced age, Hopson is a sexually active deviant, who often recounts his sexual endeavours with other men. He is also senile, which leads to many comical misunderstandings. In the pilot episode, Randall reveals that they cannot retire Stanley because the city lacks the funds to pay his pension.\n* [[Kyle Kinane]] as Bullet, a [[police dog]] who is addicted to the confiscated [[drugs]] that he is tasked with guarding.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Mayor Karen Crawford, the mayor of Paradise, Kevin's mother, and Randall's ex-wife.\n* [[Waco O'Guin]] as Robbie, a blonde redneck who sells argyle meth. Bears a striking resemblance to his ''Brickleberry'' character, Bobby Possumcods.\n* [[Roger Black (actor)|Roger Black]] as Delbert, Robbie's best friend and sidekick who also sells argyle meth. Also bears a striking resemblance to a ''Brickleberry'' character. In this case, it's BoDean (Bobby Possumcods' dim-witted friend). In the season one episode ''Task Force'', Delbert gets attacked by the Kingpin's goons due to a decline in argyle meth sales and [[Amputation|loses his right arm]] in the process; by the end of the first season he gains a robotic prosthetic. In the season two episode ''Who Ate Wally's Waffles'', it is revealed that Delbert birth name was Wally and he was artificially created by [[Imagineering|imagineers]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]] to be their next Disney star; he is stolen by Robbie's family as a kid, renamed Delbert, and [[de facto]] adopted by Robbie's family after Robbie wanted Wally for his birthday.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| allreleased = y\n| released    = y\n| color1      = #95D0EF\n| link1       = #Part 1 (2018)\n| episodes1   = 10\n| start1      = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n\n| color2      = #FED403\n| link2       = #Part 2 (2020)\n| episodes2   = 8\n| start2      = {{Start date|2020|3|6}}\n}}\n\n===Part 1 (2018)===\n{{Episode table |background=#95D0EF |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Welcome to Paradise\n |DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo\n |WrittenBy       = [[Roger Black (actor)|Roger Black]] & [[Waco O'Guin]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n |ShortSummary    = Kevin Crawford has always wanted to be a cop, just like his father...until the day Kevin accidentally castrated his father by shooting him in the testicles.

Once a fine and proud cop, following an incident where his son shot off both of his testicles, making him incredibly bitter over the next thirteen years, which eventually led to his divorce with his wife. He has to put on testosterone patches frequently in order to keep his masculinity in check.\n* [[Sarah Chalke]] as Gina Jabowski, a psychotic and violent police officer who often sexually harasses her obese coworker Dusty Marlow.  She does this because she has a [[Fat fetishism|fat fetish]] from a brain injury.\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Gerald \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald, a police officer whose [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] sometimes hinders his police work.\n* [[Dana Snyder]] as Dusty Marlow, an obese police officer who is constantly [[sexually harassed]] by Gina. He is very child-like and owns several cats.\n** Snyder also voices Stanley Hopson, an elderly [[bisexual]] police officer who often gets out-of-the-ordinary assignments from Chief Crawford. Even at his advanced age, Hopson is a sexually active deviant, who often recounts his sexual endeavours with other men. He is also senile, which leads to many comical misunderstandings. In the pilot episode, Randall reveals that they cannot retire Stanley because the city lacks the funds to pay his pension.\n* [[Kyle Kinane]] as Bullet, a [[police dog]] who is addicted to the confiscated [[drugs]] that he is tasked with guarding.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Mayor Karen Crawford, the mayor of Paradise, Kevin's mother, and Randall's ex-wife.\n* [[Waco O'Guin]] as Robbie, a blonde redneck who sells argyle meth.

Also bears a striking resemblance to a ''Brickleberry'' character. In this case, it's BoDean (Bobby Possumcods' dim-witted friend). In the season one episode ''Task Force'', Delbert gets attacked by the Kingpin's goons due to a decline in argyle meth sales and [[Amputation|loses his right arm]] in the process; by the end of the first season he gains a robotic prosthetic. In the season two episode ''Who Ate Wally's Waffles'', it is revealed that Delbert birth name was Wally and he was artificially created by [[Imagineering|imagineers]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]] to be their next Disney star; he is stolen by Robbie's family as a kid, renamed Delbert, and [[de facto]] adopted by Robbie's family after Robbie wanted Wally for his birthday.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| allreleased = y\n| released    = y\n| color1      = #95D0EF\n| link1       = #Part 1 (2018)\n| episodes1   = 10\n| start1      = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n\n| color2      = #FED403\n| link2       = #Part 2 (2020)\n| episodes2   = 8\n| start2      = {{Start date|2020|3|6}}\n}}\n\n===Part 1 (2018)===\n{{Episode table |background=#95D0EF |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Welcome to Paradise\n |DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo\n |WrittenBy       = [[Roger Black (actor)|Roger Black]] & [[Waco O'Guin]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|8|31}}\n |ShortSummary    = Kevin Crawford has always wanted to be a cop, just like his father...until the day Kevin accidentally castrated his father by shooting him in the testicles.

The airfield quickly fell into disrepair and grass grew on the former runways.{{citation needed|reason=that there were actual runways rather than a field|date=March 2019}}\n\n===The beginnings in the 1930s and 1940s===\n[[File:Dublin Airport 1940 terminal building.jpg|thumb|The original [[International style (architecture)|international style]] passenger terminal, completed in 1940]]\nIn 1936, the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] established a new civil airline, [[Aer Lingus]], which began operating from the [[Military airbase|military aerodrome]], [[Casement Aerodrome]], at [[Baldonnel, Ireland|Baldonnel]] to the southwest of [[Dublin]]. A decision was made that a civil airport should replace Baldonnel as Dublin's airport.  The former Collinstown site, extended into the neighbouring townlands of Rock and Corballis, was chosen.\n\nWork on the new airport began in 1937. By the end of 1939, a grass airfield surface, internal roads, car parks and electrical power and lighting were set up. The inaugural flight from Dublin took place on 19 January 1940 to [[Liverpool]]. In August 1938, work began on a new [[airport terminal]] building. The terminal building was designed by architect Desmond FitzGerald, brother of politician [[Garret FitzGerald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2010/1937-dublin-airport/|title=1937 \u2013 Dublin Airport \u2013 Architecture of Fingal \u2013 Archiseek.com|work=Archiseek.com|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=22 January 2010}}</ref> FitzGerald, who had designed an airport terminal as part of his college studies, led a team of architects that also included Kevin Barry, Daith\u00ed Hanley, Charles Aliaga Kelly, Dermot O'Toole and Harry Robson. The terminal building opened in early 1941, with its design heavily influenced by the tiered structure of the luxury ocean liners of the time. The terminal was awarded the Triennial Gold Medal of the Royal Hibernian Institute of Architects in 1942 and is today a listed building.\n[[File:Dublin Airport (5997469039).jpg|thumbnail|An [[Aer Lingus]] [[DC-3]] plane at Dublin Airport's original Terminal 1 in May 1950.]]\n\nDue to [[World War II]], which was known as [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]] in Ireland, services were severely restricted at Dublin Airport until late 1945. The only international scheduled routes operated during this time were by Aer Lingus to Liverpool (and for a period to [[Manchester]]'s [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]]). The end of the war meant the beginning of a major expansion in services at the airport. Aer Lingus resumed its London service to Croydon in November 1945. In 1947, [[KLM]] started the first European flights to Dublin with a service to [[Amsterdam]]. Three new concrete runways were completed in 1948, and in 1950 - after ten years in operation - the airport had welcomed a total of 920,000 passengers.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/about-us/did-you-know/history|title=History|website=www.dublinairport.com|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Expanding in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThroughout the 1950s Dublin Airport expanded with virtually uninterrupted traffic growth. Runway extensions and terminal enhancements were carried out to deal with the influx of traffic and passengers. New airlines began serving the airport also. These included [[British European Airways]], [[Sabena]], and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|BKS]].\n\nIn 1958, a new transatlantic service was started by Aer Lingus via Shannon Airport. By the mid 1950s, it was clear that the original terminal building was too small to cope with growing passenger numbers. A new North Terminal was opened in June 1959. Originally, the plan was that North Terminal would handle all US and European flights, but instead it became the arrivals terminal for all Dublin Airport passengers, while the original passenger terminal was used for departures.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the number of scheduled carriers continued to grow. By the close of the 1960s, a sizeable number of [[Boeing 737]]s, [[BAC One-Eleven]]s, [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]]s were using the airport regularly. To cope with larger aircraft in the late 1960s new departure gate piers were added close to the old terminal to cope with larger aircraft.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> These piers would subsequently be connected to Terminal 1. During 1969, the airport handled 1,737,151 passengers.\n\nThe advent of [[wide-body aircraft]] posed opportunities and challenges for aviation. In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above [[O'Connell Street]] in Dublin on [[Saint Patrick's Day]]; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. To cope with this, a new \u00a310 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known as Terminal 1, was opened in June 1972.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> The growth which was anticipated at Dublin's airport (and provided for through heavy investment by the airport and Aer Lingus) during the 1970s did not materialise immediately.\n\n[[File:Ryanair (EI-CCW), Dublin, July 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Two of the airport's largest operators side-by-side, a [[Ryanair]] [[BAC 1-11]] (front) and an Aer Lingus [[Boeing 737]] (rear) in 1993]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BDY), Dublin, July 1992 (01).jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-200 and a [[Ryanair]] BAC-111 in July 1992]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-ASI), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 747 in May 1994]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BXB), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-400 and a British Airways ATR 42]]\n\n===Continuing in the 1980s and 1990s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1983 Aer Lingus opened its 'Aer Lingus Commuter' division<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aerlingus.com/media/pdfs/AL_Precourse_Workbook_January%202017_LR_FA.pdf|title=Online pre-course Workbook, Version 2, January 2017|website=Aer Lingus|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> which took delivery of [[Short Brothers|Shorts]], [[Saab AB]] and [[Fokker]] [[turboprop]] aircraft to open regular daily domestic services to and from Ireland's smaller regional airports for the first time, as well as to serve existing routes to smaller regional airports in the United Kingdom. At various stages of its operations, flights were operated to several Irish regional airports to feed passengers into Aer Lingus's international network. These domestic destinations included [[Cork Airport]], [[Shannon Airport]], [[Kerry Airport]], [[Galway Airport]], [[Ireland West Airport Knock]], [[Waterford Airport]], [[Sligo Airport]] and [[City of Derry Airport]]. Aer Lingus Commuter has since been re-absorbed into the main company. The domestic routes, with the exception of Dublin-Shannon, were taken over by Aer Arann. Most of these routes have since been discontinued as the development of the motorway network in Ireland has resulted in significant reductions in travelling time by road. Aer Lingus has continued with the remaining Dublin\u2013UK flights.\n\nDuring the 1980s, major competition, especially on the Dublin\u2013London routes, resulted in passenger numbers swelling to 5.1 million in 1989. In the same year a new {{convert|8650|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} runway and a state-of-the-art air traffic control centre were opened. Dublin Airport continued to expand rapidly in the 1990s. Pier A, which had been the first extension to the old terminal building, was significantly extended. A new Pier C, complete with [[Jet bridge|air bridges]], was built and as soon as this was completed, work commenced to extend it to double its capacity. The ground floor of the original terminal building was returned to passenger service after many years to provide additional departure gates. Pier D, completed in October 2007, is a dedicated low-fares boarding area and provides 14 quick turn-around stands and departure gates; these are not served by air bridges.\n\n===The Bilateral Air Transport Agreement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nIn 1993, a major milestone for the airport was the signing of a new United States \u2013 Ireland [[Bilateral Air Transport Agreement|bilateral agreement]] which allowed airlines to operate some direct transatlantic services for the first time to/from Dublin Airport instead of touching down en route at Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland. (Shannon had once been a major transatlantic refuelling stop for pre-jet aircraft, and this agreement was designed to protect the interests of the Shannon region when modern jets no longer required a refuelling stop and Shannon saw a fall-off in traffic.) Airlines still had to provide an equal number of flights either to or through Shannon as to Dublin. A gradual further watering down of Shannon's so-called 'stopover' status came into effect in November 2006 when more direct flights to Dublin were allowed. The stopover requirement disappeared completely in 2008. At that time, airlines were allowed to fly direct to the US from Dublin without having to match these with any to/from Shannon. It was expected that this would result in a huge increase in services between Dublin and the US and Aer Lingus has identified 16 destinations that it would like to serve directly from Dublin.\n\n===Recent history===\nWith the success of Ireland's '[[Celtic Tiger]]' economy, Dublin Airport saw growth in the 1990s and 2000s. This demand was driven by an increased demand for business travel to and from the country, together with an increase in inward tourism and a surge in demand for foreign holidays and city breaks from the [[Irish people|Irish]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carhire.ie/airportpassengernumbers.php |title=Passenger Numbers at Irish Airports - 2002 to 2015 |publisher=Executive Trust Ltd |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe demand from Ireland's migrant workers, principally those from Eastern Europe, has resulted in a large number of new routes opening to destinations in the European Union accession states. Ireland was one of only three European Union countries (as well as the United Kingdom and Sweden) to open its borders freely to workers from the ten accession states that [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union in 2004]].\n\nThe airport saw significant declines in traffic in 2009 and 2010, although since 2011 the airport has seen an increase in traffic. During 2012, this increase continued with passenger numbers growing by 1.9%. During 2013, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were above the 20 million mark for the first time since 2009 with a 5.6% increase year on year. During 2014, this positive trend continued with an 8% increase over 2013.  As of early December 2015, passenger figures have increased by 16% compared to 2014, and the previous record of 23.46 million passengers set in 2008 has already been passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413095801/https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 April 2016  |title=Dublin Airport Breaks Annual Passenger Numbers Record |publisher=Dublin Airport |date= 4 December 2015 |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, Dublin Airport was chosen for the Special Achievement in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) award for its use of mapping software from ESRI Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.traveldailynews.com/post/dublin-airport-wins-international-award-for-mapping-software|title=Dublin Airport wins international award for mapping software}}</ref>\n\n==Long-haul traffic==\nAs of August 2019, there are services to 31 intercontinental destinations from Dublin Airport (not including [[Anatolia]]).<ref name=\"Dublin Airport Information\">{{cite web|url=https://www.carhire.ie/car-hire-dublin-airport.php |title=Dublin Airport Information |publisher=CARHIRE.ie |date= |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> In 2007, Etihad Airways began operating between Dublin Airport and Abu Dhabi, and increased its capacity to 14 weekly flights in March 2010.

On 22 March 2007, the [[Open skies]] agreement between the US and EU was ratified.

The State Airports Act 2004 also established new airport authorities at Shannon and Cork Airports. The Shannon Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority had separate boards of directors and were authorised under the Act to prepare business plans, which may have in time lead to their full separation from the Dublin Airport Authority. Following a decision by the Irish Government, Shannon Airport became a separate publicly owned airport on 31 December 2012.\n\nIn July 2013, the Dublin Airport Authority was officially renamed \"''DAA plc''\" by the Irish Government.

The project was designed by [[Pascall+Watson]] architects and the total cost was \u20ac600 million. [[Aer Lingus]] is the main carrier operating at Terminal 2 and since its opening have developed a hub at Dublin primarily for traffic traveling between Europe and the United States.  Terminal 2 is now the transatlantic gateway for flights to the United States as it features a [[United States border preclearance|US pre-clearance immigration facility]] which was previously housed in Terminal 1.\n\nConstruction of Terminal 2 began on 1 October 2007, and it was officially opened on 19 November 2010 by the then [[Taoiseach]] Brian Cowen T.D.  The intended purpose of Terminal 2 was to house all long-haul carriers in addition to Aer Lingus; however significant growth in US traffic has resulted in most long haul carriers flying outside the United States remaining in Terminal 1.  During the design of Terminal 2 provisions were made for an expanded check in hall and additional pier (Pier F) to cater for future growth.

The airfield quickly fell into disrepair and grass grew on the former runways.{{citation needed|reason=that there were actual runways rather than a field|date=March 2019}}\n\n===The beginnings in the 1930s and 1940s===\n[[File:Dublin Airport 1940 terminal building.jpg|thumb|The original [[International style (architecture)|international style]] passenger terminal, completed in 1940]]\nIn 1936, the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] established a new civil airline, [[Aer Lingus]], which began operating from the [[Military airbase|military aerodrome]], [[Casement Aerodrome]], at [[Baldonnel, Ireland|Baldonnel]] to the southwest of [[Dublin]]. A decision was made that a civil airport should replace Baldonnel as Dublin's airport.  The former Collinstown site, extended into the neighbouring townlands of Rock and Corballis, was chosen.\n\nWork on the new airport began in 1937. By the end of 1939, a grass airfield surface, internal roads, car parks and electrical power and lighting were set up. The inaugural flight from Dublin took place on 19 January 1940 to [[Liverpool]]. In August 1938, work began on a new [[airport terminal]] building. The terminal building was designed by architect Desmond FitzGerald, brother of politician [[Garret FitzGerald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2010/1937-dublin-airport/|title=1937 \u2013 Dublin Airport \u2013 Architecture of Fingal \u2013 Archiseek.com|work=Archiseek.com|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=22 January 2010}}</ref> FitzGerald, who had designed an airport terminal as part of his college studies, led a team of architects that also included Kevin Barry, Daith\u00ed Hanley, Charles Aliaga Kelly, Dermot O'Toole and Harry Robson. The terminal building opened in early 1941, with its design heavily influenced by the tiered structure of the luxury ocean liners of the time. The terminal was awarded the Triennial Gold Medal of the Royal Hibernian Institute of Architects in 1942 and is today a listed building.\n[[File:Dublin Airport (5997469039).jpg|thumbnail|An [[Aer Lingus]] [[DC-3]] plane at Dublin Airport's original Terminal 1 in May 1950.]]\n\nDue to [[World War II]], which was known as [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]] in Ireland, services were severely restricted at Dublin Airport until late 1945. The only international scheduled routes operated during this time were by Aer Lingus to Liverpool (and for a period to [[Manchester]]'s [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]]). The end of the war meant the beginning of a major expansion in services at the airport. Aer Lingus resumed its London service to Croydon in November 1945. In 1947, [[KLM]] started the first European flights to Dublin with a service to [[Amsterdam]]. Three new concrete runways were completed in 1948, and in 1950 - after ten years in operation - the airport had welcomed a total of 920,000 passengers.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/about-us/did-you-know/history|title=History|website=www.dublinairport.com|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Expanding in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThroughout the 1950s Dublin Airport expanded with virtually uninterrupted traffic growth. Runway extensions and terminal enhancements were carried out to deal with the influx of traffic and passengers. New airlines began serving the airport also. These included [[British European Airways]], [[Sabena]], and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|BKS]].\n\nIn 1958, a new transatlantic service was started by Aer Lingus via Shannon Airport. By the mid 1950s, it was clear that the original terminal building was too small to cope with growing passenger numbers. A new North Terminal was opened in June 1959. Originally, the plan was that North Terminal would handle all US and European flights, but instead it became the arrivals terminal for all Dublin Airport passengers, while the original passenger terminal was used for departures.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the number of scheduled carriers continued to grow. By the close of the 1960s, a sizeable number of [[Boeing 737]]s, [[BAC One-Eleven]]s, [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]]s were using the airport regularly. To cope with larger aircraft in the late 1960s new departure gate piers were added close to the old terminal to cope with larger aircraft.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> These piers would subsequently be connected to Terminal 1. During 1969, the airport handled 1,737,151 passengers.\n\nThe advent of [[wide-body aircraft]] posed opportunities and challenges for aviation. In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above [[O'Connell Street]] in Dublin on [[Saint Patrick's Day]]; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. To cope with this, a new \u00a310 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known as Terminal 1, was opened in June 1972.<ref name=\"dublinairport.com\"/> The growth which was anticipated at Dublin's airport (and provided for through heavy investment by the airport and Aer Lingus) during the 1970s did not materialise immediately.\n\n[[File:Ryanair (EI-CCW), Dublin, July 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Two of the airport's largest operators side-by-side, a [[Ryanair]] [[BAC 1-11]] (front) and an Aer Lingus [[Boeing 737]] (rear) in 1993]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BDY), Dublin, July 1992 (01).jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-200 and a [[Ryanair]] BAC-111 in July 1992]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-ASI), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 747 in May 1994]]\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-BXB), Dublin, May 1994.jpg|thumbnail|An Aer Lingus Boeing 737-400 and a British Airways ATR 42]]\n\n===Continuing in the 1980s and 1990s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1983 Aer Lingus opened its 'Aer Lingus Commuter' division<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aerlingus.com/media/pdfs/AL_Precourse_Workbook_January%202017_LR_FA.pdf|title=Online pre-course Workbook, Version 2, January 2017|website=Aer Lingus|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> which took delivery of [[Short Brothers|Shorts]], [[Saab AB]] and [[Fokker]] [[turboprop]] aircraft to open regular daily domestic services to and from Ireland's smaller regional airports for the first time, as well as to serve existing routes to smaller regional airports in the United Kingdom. At various stages of its operations, flights were operated to several Irish regional airports to feed passengers into Aer Lingus's international network. These domestic destinations included [[Cork Airport]], [[Shannon Airport]], [[Kerry Airport]], [[Galway Airport]], [[Ireland West Airport Knock]], [[Waterford Airport]], [[Sligo Airport]] and [[City of Derry Airport]]. Aer Lingus Commuter has since been re-absorbed into the main company. The domestic routes, with the exception of Dublin-Shannon, were taken over by Aer Arann. Most of these routes have since been discontinued as the development of the motorway network in Ireland has resulted in significant reductions in travelling time by road. Aer Lingus has continued with the remaining Dublin\u2013UK flights.\n\nDuring the 1980s, major competition, especially on the Dublin\u2013London routes, resulted in passenger numbers swelling to 5.1 million in 1989. In the same year a new {{convert|8650|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} runway and a state-of-the-art air traffic control centre were opened. Dublin Airport continued to expand rapidly in the 1990s. Pier A, which had been the first extension to the old terminal building, was significantly extended. A new Pier C, complete with [[Jet bridge|air bridges]], was built and as soon as this was completed, work commenced to extend it to double its capacity. The ground floor of the original terminal building was returned to passenger service after many years to provide additional departure gates. Pier D, completed in October 2007, is a dedicated low-fares boarding area and provides 14 quick turn-around stands and departure gates; these are not served by air bridges.\n\n===The Bilateral Air Transport Agreement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nIn 1993, a major milestone for the airport was the signing of a new United States \u2013 Ireland [[Bilateral Air Transport Agreement|bilateral agreement]] which allowed airlines to operate some direct transatlantic services for the first time to/from Dublin Airport instead of touching down en route at Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland. (Shannon had once been a major transatlantic refuelling stop for pre-jet aircraft, and this agreement was designed to protect the interests of the Shannon region when modern jets no longer required a refuelling stop and Shannon saw a fall-off in traffic.) Airlines still had to provide an equal number of flights either to or through Shannon as to Dublin. A gradual further watering down of Shannon's so-called 'stopover' status came into effect in November 2006 when more direct flights to Dublin were allowed. The stopover requirement disappeared completely in 2008. At that time, airlines were allowed to fly direct to the US from Dublin without having to match these with any to/from Shannon. It was expected that this would result in a huge increase in services between Dublin and the US and Aer Lingus has identified 16 destinations that it would like to serve directly from Dublin.\n\n===Recent history===\nWith the success of Ireland's '[[Celtic Tiger]]' economy, Dublin Airport saw growth in the 1990s and 2000s. This demand was driven by an increased demand for business travel to and from the country, together with an increase in inward tourism and a surge in demand for foreign holidays and city breaks from the [[Irish people|Irish]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carhire.ie/airportpassengernumbers.php |title=Passenger Numbers at Irish Airports - 2002 to 2015 |publisher=Executive Trust Ltd |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe demand from Ireland's migrant workers, principally those from Eastern Europe, has resulted in a large number of new routes opening to destinations in the European Union accession states. Ireland was one of only three European Union countries (as well as the United Kingdom and Sweden) to open its borders freely to workers from the ten accession states that [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union in 2004]].\n\nThe airport saw significant declines in traffic in 2009 and 2010, although since 2011 the airport has seen an increase in traffic. During 2012, this increase continued with passenger numbers growing by 1.9%. During 2013, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport were above the 20 million mark for the first time since 2009 with a 5.6% increase year on year. During 2014, this positive trend continued with an 8% increase over 2013.  As of early December 2015, passenger figures have increased by 16% compared to 2014, and the previous record of 23.46 million passengers set in 2008 has already been passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413095801/https://www.dublinairport.com/gns/at-the-airport/latest-news/15-12-04/Dublin_Airport_Breaks_Annual_Passenger_Numbers_Record.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 April 2016  |title=Dublin Airport Breaks Annual Passenger Numbers Record |publisher=Dublin Airport |date= 4 December 2015 |accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, Dublin Airport was chosen for the Special Achievement in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) award for its use of mapping software from ESRI Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.traveldailynews.com/post/dublin-airport-wins-international-award-for-mapping-software|title=Dublin Airport wins international award for mapping software}}</ref>\n\n==Long-haul traffic==\nAs of August 2019, there are services to 31 intercontinental destinations from Dublin Airport (not including [[Anatolia]]).<ref name=\"Dublin Airport Information\">{{cite web|url=https://www.carhire.ie/car-hire-dublin-airport.php |title=Dublin Airport Information |publisher=CARHIRE.ie |date= |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> In 2007, Etihad Airways began operating between Dublin Airport and Abu Dhabi, and increased its capacity to 14 weekly flights in March 2010.

In return, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] placed a limit of four airports in the US that Aer Lingus could operate to. On 22 March 2007, the [[Open skies]] agreement between the US and EU was ratified. This resulted in the immediate cancellation of the long-running 'Shannon Stopover' requirement, whereby the Irish government had insisted that 50% of all transatlantic flights between Ireland and the United States must pass through Shannon Airport.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/new-open-skies-deal-to-see-end-of-shannon-stopovers-1.361532 New 'open skies' deal to see end of Shannon stopovers], ''The Irish Times'', 6 June 2003</ref>\n\n===US border preclearance===\nDublin Airport is one of only two airports in Europe with [[United States border preclearance]] services for US-bound passengers (the other being Shannon Airport).

All assets and liabilities previously owned by Aer Rianta were transferred to Dublin Airport Authority. The State Airports Act 2004 also established new airport authorities at Shannon and Cork Airports. The Shannon Airport Authority and the Cork Airport Authority had separate boards of directors and were authorised under the Act to prepare business plans, which may have in time lead to their full separation from the Dublin Airport Authority. Following a decision by the Irish Government, Shannon Airport became a separate publicly owned airport on 31 December 2012.\n\nIn July 2013, the Dublin Airport Authority was officially renamed \"''DAA plc''\" by the Irish Government. The rename was principally to remove the \"Dublin\" and \"Authority\" elements of the name which were seen to have little relevance to the overall functions of DAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinairportguide.com/daa-rename/|title=Dublin Airport Guide.com \u2013 Dublin Airport Authority Renamed|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> The name change announced in July 2013 took effect on 6 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daa.ie/gns/media-centre/press-releases/14-11-06/Name_Change_Takes_Effect_At_daa.aspx|title=Press Releases > Name Change Takes Effect At daa|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212319/http://www.daa.ie/gns/media-centre/press-releases/14-11-06/Name_Change_Takes_Effect_At_daa.aspx|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs the largest gateway to Ireland, over 25 million passengers travelled through the airport in 2015, a 15% increase over the previous year.<ref name=\"issuu.com\">{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/daapublishing/docs/daa_annual_report_2015/1|title=daa Annual Report 2015|website=issuu|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref> The main contributors to the growth in traffic in 2015 were the 23 new routes launched during the year and extra capacity on 40 existing services.

The project was designed by [[Pascall+Watson]] architects and the total cost was \u20ac600 million. [[Aer Lingus]] is the main carrier operating at Terminal 2 and since its opening have developed a hub at Dublin primarily for traffic traveling between Europe and the United States.  Terminal 2 is now the transatlantic gateway for flights to the United States as it features a [[United States border preclearance|US pre-clearance immigration facility]] which was previously housed in Terminal 1.\n\nConstruction of Terminal 2 began on 1 October 2007, and it was officially opened on 19 November 2010 by the then [[Taoiseach]] Brian Cowen T.D.  The intended purpose of Terminal 2 was to house all long-haul carriers in addition to Aer Lingus; however significant growth in US traffic has resulted in most long haul carriers flying outside the United States remaining in Terminal 1.  During the design of Terminal 2 provisions were made for an expanded check in hall and additional pier (Pier F) to cater for future growth.  Currently [[Aer Lingus]], [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Norwegian Air International|Norwegian]] and [[United Airlines]] operate from Terminal 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dublinairport.com/flight-information/airlines-terminal-2 |title=Airlines Flying From Dublin Airport T2 |publisher=Dublin Airport T2 |accessdate=1 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606024510/https://www.dublinairport.com/flight-information/airlines-terminal-2 |archivedate=6 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Safety and security==\nDAA has its own branch of the [[Airport Police (Ireland)|Airport Police Service]] which is mandated to provide aviation and general policing at the airport.
