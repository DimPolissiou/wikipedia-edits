It was commissioned in the early 17th century by emperor [[Shah Jahan]] and was located in the [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]] (Hall of Private Audiences, or Ministers' Room) in the [[Red Fort]] of [[Delhi]]. The original throne was subsequently captured and taken as a war trophy in 1739 by the Persian emperor [[Nadir Shah]], and has been kept in the Topkapi Palace ever since then . A replacement throne based on the original was commissioned afterwards and existed until the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Shah Jahan op de pauwentroon.jpg|thumb|[[Shah Jahan]] seated on a minor throne, which probably shared some stylistic elements with the Peacock Throne]]\nShah Jahan ruled in what is considered the [[Golden Age]] of the vast Mughal Empire, which covered almost all of the Indian subcontinent. He ruled from the newly constructed capital of [[Shahjahanabad]]. The emperor was the focus around which everything else revolved, giving audiences and receiving petitioners. The ruler's court was to be a mirror image of paradise on earth, in the very centre of the empire; and such a ruler would be worthy of a [[Throne of Solomon]] (\u062a\u062e\u062a \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646, Takht-e-Sulaiman) to underscore his position as a just king. Just like Solomon's throne, the Peacock Throne was to be covered in gold and jewels, with steps leading up to it, with the ruler floating above ground and closer to heaven. Said Gilani and his workmen from the imperial goldsmiths' department were commissioned with the construction of this new throne. It took seven years to complete. Large amounts of solid gold, precious stones and pearls were used, creating a masterful piece of Mughal workmanship that was unsurpassed before or after its creation. It was an opulent indulgence that could only be seen by a small number of courtiers, aristocrats, and visiting dignitaries. The throne was, even by Golden Age Mughal standards, supremely extravagant, costing twice as much as the construction of the Taj Mahal.<ref name=\"Nicoll 2009 207\">{{cite book |last=Nicoll |first=Fergus |year=2009 |title=Shah Jahan |url={{Google books|KfkCTTcvKGwC|Shah Jahan|page=207|plainurl=yes}} |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=978 0670083039 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/book3.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Books|publisher=Tribuneindia.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000130/spectrum/main7.htm|title=As priceless as the Peacock Throne|author=K.R.N.

Aurangzeb was the last of the strong Mughal emperors. After his death, in 1707, his son [[Bahadur Shah I]] reigned from 1707\u20131712. Bahadur Shah I was able to keep the empire stable, by maintaining a relaxed religious policy; however, after his death the empire was in inexorable decline. A period of political instability, military defeats, and court intrigues led to a succession of weak emperors: [[Jahandar Shah]] ruled for one year from 1712\u20131713, [[Farrukhsiyar]] from 1713\u20131719, [[Rafi ud-Darajat]] and [[Shah Jahan II]] only for a couple of months in 1719. By the time [[Muhammad Shah]] came to power, Mughal power was in serious decline and the empire was vulnerable. Nevertheless, under the generous patronage of Muhammad Shah, the court at Delhi became again a beacon of the arts and culture. Administrative reforms could not however stop the later [[Mughal-Maratha Wars]], which greatly sapped the imperial forces. It was only a question of time until forces from neighbouring Persia saw their chance to invade.\n[[File:Nadir Shah on the Peacock Throne after his defeat of Muhammad Shah. ca. 1850, San Diego MOA.jpg|thumb|The Persian king [[Nader Shah]] seated upon the Peacock Throne with members of the court, after his victory at the [[Battle of Karnal]]]]\n[[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire]] culminated in the [[Battle of Karnal]], on 13 February  1739, and the defeat of Muhammad Shah. Nadir Shah entered Delhi and sacked the city, in the course of which tens of thousands of inhabitants were massacred. Persian troops left Delhi at the beginning of May 1739, taking with them the throne as a war trophy, their haul of treasure amounting to a large reduction in Mughal wealth and an irreplaceable loss of cultural artefacts.

During this visit, Tavernier not only sold several jewels to the emperor and the emperor's uncle Jafar Khan, but established a close relationship with the emperor that led to a longer stay. Tavernier was invited to stay until the conclusion of the emperor's annual birthday celebrations, during which time he had the opportunity to visit the Red Fort and inspect the Peacock Throne. He was also given the opportunity to inspect the valuable jewels and stones belonging to the emperor, but was not able to see those still kept by Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned at Agra Fort. In January 1666, only few months after Tavernier's stay, Shah Jahan died and Aurangzeb claimed the remaining stones.\n\nTavernier gives a detailed description of the Peacock Throne in his book ''Les Six Voyages de J.

There is to be seen, moreover, a sword suspended from this throne, a mace, a round shield, a bow and quiver with arrows; and all these weapons, as also the cushion and steps, both of this throne and the other six, are covered over with stones which match those with which each of the thrones is respectively enriched.\n\nI counted the large balass rubies on the great throne, and there are about 108, all cabuchons, the least of which weighs 100 carats, but there are some which weigh apparently 200 and more. As for the emeralds, there are plenty of good colour, but they have many flaws; the largest may weigh 60 carats and the least 30 carats. I counted about 116; thus there are more emeralds than rubies.\n\nThe underside of the canopy is covered with diamonds and pearls, with a fringe of pearls all round, and above the canopy, which is a quadrangular-shaped dome, there is to be seen a peacock with elevated tail made of blue sapphires and other coloured stones, the body being of gold inlaid with precious stones, having a large ruby in front of the breast, from whence hangs a pear-shaped pearl of 50 carats or thereabouts, and of a somewhat yellow water. On both sides of<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/travelsinindia01tavegoog#page/n460|title=Travels in India|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref> the peacock there is a large bouquet of the same height as the bird, and consisting of many kinds of flowers made of gold inlaid with precious stones. On the side of the throne which is opposite the court there is to be seen a jewel consisting of a diamond of from 80 to 90 carats weight, with rubies and emeralds round it, and when the King is seated he has this jewel in full view.\n\nBut that which in my opinion is the most costly thing about this magnificent throne is, that the twelve columns supporting the canopy are surrounded with beautiful rows of pearls, which are round and of fine water, and weigh from 6 to 10 carats each. At 4 feet distance from the throne there are fixed, on either side, two umbrellas, the sticks of which for 7 or 8 feet in height are covered with diamonds, rubies, and pearls. The umbrellas are of red velvet, and are embroidered and fringed all round with pearls.\n\nThis is what I have been able to observe regarding this famous throne, commenced by Tamerlane and completed by Sh\u0101hjah\u0101n; and those who keep the accounts of the King\u2019s jewels, and of the cost of this great work, have assured me that it amounts to 107,000 lakhs of rupees, which amount to 160,500,000 livres of our money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/travelsinindia01tavegoog#page/n462|title=Travels in India|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nTavernier, however, describes seeing the throne in what is probably the ''[[Diwan-i-Am (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Am]]''. One theory is that the throne was sometimes moved between the two halls, depending on the occasion. Tavernier also describes five other thrones in the ''Diwan-i-Khas''.\n\n== Discrepancies between descriptions of Lahori and Tavernier ==\n[[File:Shah Alam II (1759-1806), the blind mughal Emperor, seated on a golden throne..jpg|thumb|Shah Alam II seated on the throne, next to him the crown prince. Although the original Peacock Throne was lost by the time of this painting, it depicts what was either a replacement throne modelled on the original one, or painted from memories and descriptions (circa 1800)]]\n[[File:Ghulam Murtaza Khan The Delhi Darbar of Akbar II.jpg|thumb|Akbar II seated on the throne (circa 1811)]]\n[[File:Akbar II in durbar.jpg|thumb|Akbar II in ''durbar'' (holding court) in the ''Diwan-i Khas'' at the Red Fort (circa 1830)]]\n\nThe descriptions of Lahori, from before 1648, and Tavernier's, published in 1676, are generally in broad agreement on the most important features of the thrones, such as its rectangular shape, standing on four legs at its corners, the 12 columns on which the canopy rests, and the type of gemstones embedded on the throne, such as balas rubies, emeralds, pearls, diamonds, and other coloured stones. There are however some significant differences between the two descriptions:\n\n* Lahori's account of the throne, based on the language used, could be a description of the projected design. Tavernier's account of the throne seems to be an eye-witness observation during his visit, in 1665, to the Red Fort. It could be that there were differences between the projected and final designs of the throne that Shah Jah\u0101n ascended for the first time on 12 March 1635.\n* According to Lahori, the throne was to have a length of 3 yards (9 feet) and a breadth of 2\u00bd yards (7\u00bd feet). Tavernier however gives the length at 6 feet and breadth of 4 feet. The height is described by Lahori as 5 yards (15 feet), but Tavernier's account does not mention its total height. Only the height of the four legs at the corners are mentioned, which was about 2 feet.\n* Lahori describes the canopy as being supported by 12 emerald columns, Tavernier describes 12 columns that were surrounded by and embedded with rows of pearls, which were round and of fine water, and which weighed from 6 to 10 carats each. He thinks these pearls were in fact the most costly and precious aspect of the throne.\n* A major difference is the position of the eponymous peacock statues. Lahori states that on the top of each pillar there were to be two peacocks, thick-set with gems, and between each two peacocks, a tree set with rubies and diamonds, emeralds and pearls. If the reference to \"pillar\" here means \"column\" there would be 24 peacocks right round the throne. Tavernier however saw only a single large peacock above the quadrangular-shaped, dome-like canopy, with an elevated tail, embedded with blue sapphires and other coloured stones, the body of the peacock being made of gold inlaid with precious stones, having a large ruby in front of the breast, from which hung a pear-shaped pearl around 60 carats in weight. Apart from the single large peacock, Tavernier's account speaks of a large bouquet, representing many kinds of flowers, made of gold inlaid with precious stones, of the same height as the peacock, situated on either side of the peacock.\n* According to Lahori, ascending the throne was by way of three steps, which were also set with jewels of fine water. Tavernier however describes four steps on the longer side of the throne and embedded with the same types of gemstones used on the throne, and with matching designs.\n\nApart from the significant differences between the two accounts given above, there are several details given in Lahori's account that are not mentioned in Tavernier's, and vice versa.\n\n=== Lahori's description ===\n* Lahori's account mentions several historical diamonds that decorated the throne, such as the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, the 95-carat Akbar Shah diamond, the 88.77-carat Shah diamond and the 83-carat Jahangir diamond, apart from the 352.50-carat Timur Ruby, the third-largest balas ruby in the world. Tavernier makes no mention of these most precious stones. One explanation is that when Tavernier saw the throne in 1665, all these historical diamonds and the balas ruby were in the possession of Shah Jahan, who was under house arrest at the Fort in Agra. Shah Jahan died on 22 January 1666\u2014two months after Tavernier left Delhi, and reached Bengal, during this, his sixth, and last, voyage to India\u2014and his son and successor Aurangzeb was able to claim all these gems. Lahori's descriptions were made during the rule of Shah Jahan, when all the gems were probably incorporated in the throne.\n* According to Lahori, a twenty-couplet poem by the poet Muhammad Qudsi praising Shah Jahan in emerald letters was embedded in the throne. Tavernier does not mention this in his account, either because of his inability to read and understand what was written, or because Aurangzeb had ordered its removal.\n\n=== Tavernier's description ===\nTavernier was allowed to closely inspect the throne and its jewels and wrote the most well known detailed description to date.\n\n* In his account, Tavernier gave details of the design in which the balas rubies, emeralds, diamonds, and pearls were arranged on the four horizontal bars connecting the four vertical legs, from which the 12 vertical columns, supporting the canopy, arose. In the middle of each bar, a large cabochon-cut balas ruby was placed, surrounded by four emeralds forming a square cross. Smaller such square crosses were situated on either side of the central large cross, along the length of the bar, but arranged in such a way that while in one square cross a balas ruby occupied the center, surrounded by four emeralds, in the next square cross, an emerald was surrounded by four balas rubies. The emeralds were table-cut and the intervals between the emerald-and-ruby crosses, were covered with diamonds, also table-cut and not exceeding 10 to 12 carats in weight.\n* There were three cushions or pillows upon the throne. The one placed behind the emperor's back was large and round; the other two, placed at his sides, were flat. The cushions were also studded with gems.\n* Tavernier mentioned some royal standards and weapons that were suspended from the throne, such as a mace, a sword and a round shield, and a bow and quiver with arrows, all studded with gemstones.\n* He counted the number of large balas rubies and emeralds on the throne. Accordingly, there were 108 large balas rubies on the throne, all cabochon-cut, the smallest weighing around 100 carats and the largest over 200 carats in weight. He counted 116 large emeralds on the throne, all of excellent colour, but with many flaws (a characteristic feature of emeralds), the smallest weighing around 30 carats and the largest around 60 carats.\n* The underside of the canopy was covered with diamonds and pearls, with a fringe of pearls all round.\n* On the side of the throne facing the court was suspended a diamond of 80 to 90 carats in weight, with rubies and emeralds surrounding it. When the Emperor was seated on the throne, this suspended arrangement of jewels was in full view in front of him.\n* Tavernier then wrote about two large gem-studded royal umbrellas, which were not part of the throne, but were placed on either side of the throne, at a distance of 4 feet from it. The central stems of these umbrellas, 7 to 8 feet long, were covered with diamonds, rubies, and pearls. The cloth of the umbrella was made of red velvet, and embroidered and fringed all round with pearls. The height of these umbrellas might give an indication as to the height of the throne, which was probably of the same height. Thus, the height of the throne would have been around 7 to 10 feet.\n\n== Later Peacock Throne ==\n{{unref|section|date=March 2019}}\nAfter Nadir Shah [[Nader Shah's invasion of India|looted the original]], another throne was made for the Mughal emperor. Along with the Peacock Throne, Nadir had also taken the fabulous [[Koh-i Noor]] and [[Darya-i Noor]] diamonds to [[Persia]], where some became part of the [[Iranian crown jewels|Persian crown jewels]], and others were sold to the [[Ottomans]]. The plunder taken by Nadir was so great that he stopped taxation for 3 years. The bottom half of the Peacock Throne might have been converted into the [[Sun Throne]] also a part of the Persian crown jewels. Various 19th-century Indian paintings of this later throne exist. It was located in the ''Diwan-i-Khas'' and might have been smaller in size than the original. However, the appearance would have been similar, based on either the original plans or from memory and eye-witness accounts. The replacement throne was made out of gold, or was gilded, and was studded with precious and semi-precious stones. Just like the original, it featured 12 columns. The columns carried a Bengali ''[[do-chala]]'' roof, which was graced with two peacock statues on the two ends, carrying pearl necklaces in their beaks, and two peacocks at the top, also carrying pearl necklaces in their beaks. The two lower peacocks were in the center underneath a flower bouquet made out of jewels, or under a royal umbrella. This throne was protected by a canopy made out of precious and colorful textiles, and gold and silver threads. The canopy was carried by four slender columns or beams made out of metal. Underneath the throne, colorful and precious carpets were laid out.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Golden Throne (Mysore)]]\n* [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh's throne]]\n* [[Marble Throne]]\n* [[Naderi Throne]]\n* [[Sun Throne]]\n* [[Throne of Jahangir]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{EB1911|title=Delhi|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabrit07chisrich#page/954/mode/2up|first=|last=|volume=7|page=955a}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last=Curzon |first=George Nathaniel |year=1892 |title=Persia and the Persian Question |url={{Google books|gM0oAAAAYAAJ|Persia and the Persian Question|page=|plainurl=yes}} |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green & Co. |isbn= |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite book |last= |first= |year=1929 |title=Delhi Fort: A Guide to the Building and Gardens |url={{Google books|OzUKAQAAIAAJ|Delhi Fort: A Guide to the Building and Gardens|page=|plainurl=yes}} |location=Delhi |publisher=[[Archaeological Survey of India]] |isbn= |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Waldemar |year=1986 |title=The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India |url={{Google books|AV--abKg9GEC|The Peacock Throne: The Drama of Mogul India|page=|plainurl=yes}} |location=Delhi |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0225-4 |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Swamy |first1=K.R.N. |last2=Ravi|first2=Meera|year=1993 |title=The Peacock Thrones of the World |url={{Google books|oyUFAQAAIAAJ|The Peacock Thrones of the World|page=|plainurl=yes}} |location= |publisher=Alpine Fine Arts Collection |isbn= |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Swamy |first1=K.R.N. |last2=Ravi|first2=Meera|year=2003 |title=The Mughal Peacock Throne ; A Reference Anthology |url={{Google books|3iyYtgAACAAJ|The Peacock Thrones of the World|page=|plainurl=yes}} |location=Kolkata |publisher=Writers Workshop Greybird Book |isbn= |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite book |last=Batra |first=N.

It was commissioned in the early 17th century by emperor [[Shah Jahan]] and was located in the [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]] (Hall of Private Audiences, or Ministers' Room) in the [[Red Fort]] of [[Delhi]]. The original throne was subsequently captured and taken as a war trophy in 1739 by the Persian emperor [[Nadir Shah]], and has been lost since. A replacement throne based on the original was commissioned afterwards and existed until the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Shah Jahan op de pauwentroon.jpg|thumb|[[Shah Jahan]] seated on a minor throne, which probably shared some stylistic elements with the Peacock Throne]]\nShah Jahan ruled in what is considered the [[Golden Age]] of the vast Mughal Empire, which covered almost all of the Indian subcontinent. He ruled from the newly constructed capital of [[Shahjahanabad]]. The emperor was the focus around which everything else revolved, giving audiences and receiving petitioners. The ruler's court was to be a mirror image of paradise on earth, in the very centre of the empire; and such a ruler would be worthy of a [[Throne of Solomon]] (\u062a\u062e\u062a \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646, Takht-e-Sulaiman) to underscore his position as a just king. Just like Solomon's throne, the Peacock Throne was to be covered in gold and jewels, with steps leading up to it, with the ruler floating above ground and closer to heaven. Said Gilani and his workmen from the imperial goldsmiths' department were commissioned with the construction of this new throne. It took seven years to complete. Large amounts of solid gold, precious stones and pearls were used, creating a masterful piece of Mughal workmanship that was unsurpassed before or after its creation. It was an opulent indulgence that could only be seen by a small number of courtiers, aristocrats, and visiting dignitaries. The throne was, even by Golden Age Mughal standards, supremely extravagant, costing twice as much as the construction of the Taj Mahal.<ref name=\"Nicoll 2009 207\">{{cite book |last=Nicoll |first=Fergus |year=2009 |title=Shah Jahan |url={{Google books|KfkCTTcvKGwC|Shah Jahan|page=207|plainurl=yes}} |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=978 0670083039 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/book3.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Books|publisher=Tribuneindia.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000130/spectrum/main7.htm|title=As priceless as the Peacock Throne|author=K.R.N.

Aurangzeb was the last of the strong Mughal emperors. After his death, in 1707, his son [[Bahadur Shah I]] reigned from 1707\u20131712. Bahadur Shah I was able to keep the empire stable, by maintaining a relaxed religious policy; however, after his death the empire was in inexorable decline. A period of political instability, military defeats, and court intrigues led to a succession of weak emperors: [[Jahandar Shah]] ruled for one year from 1712\u20131713, [[Farrukhsiyar]] from 1713\u20131719, [[Rafi ud-Darajat]] and [[Shah Jahan II]] only for a couple of months in 1719. By the time [[Muhammad Shah]] came to power, Mughal power was in serious decline and the empire was vulnerable. Nevertheless, under the generous patronage of Muhammad Shah, the court at Delhi became again a beacon of the arts and culture. Administrative reforms could not however stop the later [[Mughal-Maratha Wars]], which greatly sapped the imperial forces. It was only a question of time until forces from neighbouring Persia saw their chance to invade.\n[[File:Nadir Shah on the Peacock Throne after his defeat of Muhammad Shah. ca. 1850, San Diego MOA.jpg|thumb|The Persian king [[Nader Shah]] seated upon the Peacock Throne with members of the court, after his victory at the [[Battle of Karnal]]]]\n[[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire]] culminated in the [[Battle of Karnal]], on 13 February  1739, and the defeat of Muhammad Shah.

They ought therefore, to be put to such a use, that beholders might share in and benefit by their splendour, and that Majesty might shine with increased brilliancy.\n\nIt was accordingly ordered that, in addition to the jewels in the Imperial jewel-house, rubies, garnets, diamonds, rich pearls and emeralds, to the value of 200 [[Lakh|lacs]] of rupees, should be brought for the inspection of the Emperor, and that they, with some exquisite jewels of great weight, exceeding 50,000 [[Mithqal|miskals]], and worth eighty-six lacs of rupees, having been carefully selected, should be handed over to Bebadal Khan, the superintendent of the goldsmith's department.

It was his great privilege to be invited to visit the court at Delhi by emperor Aurangzeb himself, where he remained as Aurangzeb's guest for two months, from 12 September 1665 to 11 November 1665.\n\nTavernier was invited so the emperor could inspect the jewels he had brought from the west, with the intent of purchasing them. During this visit, Tavernier not only sold several jewels to the emperor and the emperor's uncle Jafar Khan, but established a close relationship with the emperor that led to a longer stay. Tavernier was invited to stay until the conclusion of the emperor's annual birthday celebrations, during which time he had the opportunity to visit the Red Fort and inspect the Peacock Throne. He was also given the opportunity to inspect the valuable jewels and stones belonging to the emperor, but was not able to see those still kept by Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned at Agra Fort. In January 1666, only few months after Tavernier's stay, Shah Jahan died and Aurangzeb claimed the remaining stones.\n\nTavernier gives a detailed description of the Peacock Throne in his book ''Les Six Voyages de J. B. Tavernier'', which was published in 1676 in two volumes. The account of the throne appears in Chapter VIII of Volume II, in which he describes the preparations for the emperor's annual birthday festival, and also the magnificence of the court.

Upon the four feet, which are very massive and from {{convert|20|in|cm}} to {{convert|25|in|cm}} high, are fixed the four bars<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/travelsinindia01tavegoog#page/n458|title=Travels in India|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref> which support the base of the throne, and upon these bars are ranged twelve columns, which sustain the canopy on three sides, there not being any on that which faces the court. Both the feet and the bars, which are more than 18 inches long, are covered with gold inlaid and enriched with numerous diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.\n\nIn the middle of each bar there is a large balass ruby, cut en cabuchon, with four emeralds round it, which form a square cross. Next in succession, from one side to the other along the length of the bars there are similar crosses, arranged so that in one the ruby is in the middle of four emeralds, and in another the emerald is in the middle and four balass rubies surround it. The emeralds are table-cut, and the intervals between the rubies and emeralds are covered with diamonds, the largest of which do not exceed 10 to 12 carats in weight, all being showy stones, but very flat.\n\nThere are also in some parts pearls set in gold, and upon one of the longer sides of the throne there are four steps to ascend it. Of the three cushions or pillows which are upon the throne, that which is placed behind the King's back is large and round like one of our bolsters, and the two others that are placed at his sides are flat. There is to be seen, moreover, a sword suspended from this throne, a mace, a round shield, a bow and quiver with arrows; and all these weapons, as also the cushion and steps, both of this throne and the other six, are covered over with stones which match those with which each of the thrones is respectively enriched.\n\nI counted the large balass rubies on the great throne, and there are about 108, all cabuchons, the least of which weighs 100 carats, but there are some which weigh apparently 200 and more. As for the emeralds, there are plenty of good colour, but they have many flaws; the largest may weigh 60 carats and the least 30 carats. I counted about 116; thus there are more emeralds than rubies.\n\nThe underside of the canopy is covered with diamonds and pearls, with a fringe of pearls all round, and above the canopy, which is a quadrangular-shaped dome, there is to be seen a peacock with elevated tail made of blue sapphires and other coloured stones, the body being of gold inlaid with precious stones, having a large ruby in front of the breast, from whence hangs a pear-shaped pearl of 50 carats or thereabouts, and of a somewhat yellow water. On both sides of<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/travelsinindia01tavegoog#page/n460|title=Travels in India|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref> the peacock there is a large bouquet of the same height as the bird, and consisting of many kinds of flowers made of gold inlaid with precious stones. On the side of the throne which is opposite the court there is to be seen a jewel consisting of a diamond of from 80 to 90 carats weight, with rubies and emeralds round it, and when the King is seated he has this jewel in full view.\n\nBut that which in my opinion is the most costly thing about this magnificent throne is, that the twelve columns supporting the canopy are surrounded with beautiful rows of pearls, which are round and of fine water, and weigh from 6 to 10 carats each. At 4 feet distance from the throne there are fixed, on either side, two umbrellas, the sticks of which for 7 or 8 feet in height are covered with diamonds, rubies, and pearls. The umbrellas are of red velvet, and are embroidered and fringed all round with pearls.\n\nThis is what I have been able to observe regarding this famous throne, commenced by Tamerlane and completed by Sh\u0101hjah\u0101n; and those who keep the accounts of the King\u2019s jewels, and of the cost of this great work, have assured me that it amounts to 107,000 lakhs of rupees, which amount to 160,500,000 livres of our money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/travelsinindia01tavegoog#page/n462|title=Travels in India|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nTavernier, however, describes seeing the throne in what is probably the ''[[Diwan-i-Am (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Am]]''. One theory is that the throne was sometimes moved between the two halls, depending on the occasion. Tavernier also describes five other thrones in the ''Diwan-i-Khas''.\n\n== Discrepancies between descriptions of Lahori and Tavernier ==\n[[File:Shah Alam II (1759-1806), the blind mughal Emperor, seated on a golden throne..jpg|thumb|Shah Alam II seated on the throne, next to him the crown prince. Although the original Peacock Throne was lost by the time of this painting, it depicts what was either a replacement throne modelled on the original one, or painted from memories and descriptions (circa 1800)]]\n[[File:Ghulam Murtaza Khan The Delhi Darbar of Akbar II.jpg|thumb|Akbar II seated on the throne (circa 1811)]]\n[[File:Akbar II in durbar.jpg|thumb|Akbar II in ''durbar'' (holding court) in the ''Diwan-i Khas'' at the Red Fort (circa 1830)]]\n\nThe descriptions of Lahori, from before 1648, and Tavernier's, published in 1676, are generally in broad agreement on the most important features of the thrones, such as its rectangular shape, standing on four legs at its corners, the 12 columns on which the canopy rests, and the type of gemstones embedded on the throne, such as balas rubies, emeralds, pearls, diamonds, and other coloured stones. There are however some significant differences between the two descriptions:\n\n* Lahori's account of the throne, based on the language used, could be a description of the projected design. Tavernier's account of the throne seems to be an eye-witness observation during his visit, in 1665, to the Red Fort. It could be that there were differences between the projected and final designs of the throne that Shah Jah\u0101n ascended for the first time on 12 March 1635.\n* According to Lahori, the throne was to have a length of 3 yards (9 feet) and a breadth of 2\u00bd yards (7\u00bd feet). Tavernier however gives the length at 6 feet and breadth of 4 feet. The height is described by Lahori as 5 yards (15 feet), but Tavernier's account does not mention its total height. Only the height of the four legs at the corners are mentioned, which was about 2 feet.\n* Lahori describes the canopy as being supported by 12 emerald columns, Tavernier describes 12 columns that were surrounded by and embedded with rows of pearls, which were round and of fine water, and which weighed from 6 to 10 carats each. He thinks these pearls were in fact the most costly and precious aspect of the throne.\n* A major difference is the position of the eponymous peacock statues. Lahori states that on the top of each pillar there were to be two peacocks, thick-set with gems, and between each two peacocks, a tree set with rubies and diamonds, emeralds and pearls. If the reference to \"pillar\" here means \"column\" there would be 24 peacocks right round the throne. Tavernier however saw only a single large peacock above the quadrangular-shaped, dome-like canopy, with an elevated tail, embedded with blue sapphires and other coloured stones, the body of the peacock being made of gold inlaid with precious stones, having a large ruby in front of the breast, from which hung a pear-shaped pearl around 60 carats in weight. Apart from the single large peacock, Tavernier's account speaks of a large bouquet, representing many kinds of flowers, made of gold inlaid with precious stones, of the same height as the peacock, situated on either side of the peacock.\n* According to Lahori, ascending the throne was by way of three steps, which were also set with jewels of fine water. Tavernier however describes four steps on the longer side of the throne and embedded with the same types of gemstones used on the throne, and with matching designs.\n\nApart from the significant differences between the two accounts given above, there are several details given in Lahori's account that are not mentioned in Tavernier's, and vice versa.\n\n=== Lahori's description ===\n* Lahori's account mentions several historical diamonds that decorated the throne, such as the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, the 95-carat Akbar Shah diamond, the 88.77-carat Shah diamond and the 83-carat Jahangir diamond, apart from the 352.50-carat Timur Ruby, the third-largest balas ruby in the world. Tavernier makes no mention of these most precious stones. One explanation is that when Tavernier saw the throne in 1665, all these historical diamonds and the balas ruby were in the possession of Shah Jahan, who was under house arrest at the Fort in Agra. Shah Jahan died on 22 January 1666\u2014two months after Tavernier left Delhi, and reached Bengal, during this, his sixth, and last, voyage to India\u2014and his son and successor Aurangzeb was able to claim all these gems. Lahori's descriptions were made during the rule of Shah Jahan, when all the gems were probably incorporated in the throne.\n* According to Lahori, a twenty-couplet poem by the poet Muhammad Qudsi praising Shah Jahan in emerald letters was embedded in the throne. Tavernier does not mention this in his account, either because of his inability to read and understand what was written, or because Aurangzeb had ordered its removal.\n\n=== Tavernier's description ===\nTavernier was allowed to closely inspect the throne and its jewels and wrote the most well known detailed description to date.\n\n* In his account, Tavernier gave details of the design in which the balas rubies, emeralds, diamonds, and pearls were arranged on the four horizontal bars connecting the four vertical legs, from which the 12 vertical columns, supporting the canopy, arose. In the middle of each bar, a large cabochon-cut balas ruby was placed, surrounded by four emeralds forming a square cross. Smaller such square crosses were situated on either side of the central large cross, along the length of the bar, but arranged in such a way that while in one square cross a balas ruby occupied the center, surrounded by four emeralds, in the next square cross, an emerald was surrounded by four balas rubies. The emeralds were table-cut and the intervals between the emerald-and-ruby crosses, were covered with diamonds, also table-cut and not exceeding 10 to 12 carats in weight.\n* There were three cushions or pillows upon the throne. The one placed behind the emperor's back was large and round; the other two, placed at his sides, were flat. The cushions were also studded with gems.\n* Tavernier mentioned some royal standards and weapons that were suspended from the throne, such as a mace, a sword and a round shield, and a bow and quiver with arrows, all studded with gemstones.\n* He counted the number of large balas rubies and emeralds on the throne. Accordingly, there were 108 large balas rubies on the throne, all cabochon-cut, the smallest weighing around 100 carats and the largest over 200 carats in weight. He counted 116 large emeralds on the throne, all of excellent colour, but with many flaws (a characteristic feature of emeralds), the smallest weighing around 30 carats and the largest around 60 carats.\n* The underside of the canopy was covered with diamonds and pearls, with a fringe of pearls all round.\n* On the side of the throne facing the court was suspended a diamond of 80 to 90 carats in weight, with rubies and emeralds surrounding it. When the Emperor was seated on the throne, this suspended arrangement of jewels was in full view in front of him.\n* Tavernier then wrote about two large gem-studded royal umbrellas, which were not part of the throne, but were placed on either side of the throne, at a distance of 4 feet from it. The central stems of these umbrellas, 7 to 8 feet long, were covered with diamonds, rubies, and pearls. The cloth of the umbrella was made of red velvet, and embroidered and fringed all round with pearls. The height of these umbrellas might give an indication as to the height of the throne, which was probably of the same height. Thus, the height of the throne would have been around 7 to 10 feet.\n\n== Later Peacock Throne ==\n{{unref|section|date=March 2019}}\nAfter Nadir Shah [[Nader Shah's invasion of India|looted the original]], another throne was made for the Mughal emperor. Along with the Peacock Throne, Nadir had also taken the fabulous [[Koh-i Noor]] and [[Darya-i Noor]] diamonds to [[Persia]], where some became part of the [[Iranian crown jewels|Persian crown jewels]], and others were sold to the [[Ottomans]]. The plunder taken by Nadir was so great that he stopped taxation for 3 years. The bottom half of the Peacock Throne might have been converted into the [[Sun Throne]] also a part of the Persian crown jewels. Various 19th-century Indian paintings of this later throne exist. It was located in the ''Diwan-i-Khas'' and might have been smaller in size than the original. However, the appearance would have been similar, based on either the original plans or from memory and eye-witness accounts. The replacement throne was made out of gold, or was gilded, and was studded with precious and semi-precious stones. Just like the original, it featured 12 columns. The columns carried a Bengali ''[[do-chala]]'' roof, which was graced with two peacock statues on the two ends, carrying pearl necklaces in their beaks, and two peacocks at the top, also carrying pearl necklaces in their beaks.

The meme became especially popular with teenagers, and since then, there has been a sharp increase in poisoning incidents.<ref name=Molloy2018/> Responding to the growing number of incidents,

Between 2012 and 2013, [[poison control center]]s reported over 7,000 cases of young children eating laundry pods, and ingestion of Procter & Gamble laundry pods had resulted in six deaths by 2017.<ref name=\"Janeway2017\"/> In response to the dangers, Procter & Gamble changed Tide Pod containers to an opaque design, introduced warning labels and added a bitter tasting chemical to the pod contents.\n\nThe pods have been sold since 2012. In late December 2017, Tide Pods became the center of an [[Internet meme]], which involves a dare to intentionally consume the pods. The meme became especially popular with teenagers, and since then, there has been a sharp increase in poisoning incidents.<ref name=Molloy2018/> Responding to the growing number of incidents, [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] started removing videos that featured the challenge, and Procter & Gamble aired numerous advertisements urging people to avoid eating the pods.\n\n==Health

In this system, and other continental criminal procedures, a formal inquisitorial process was conducted by a judge before the trial itself, which lacked, according to Lord Phillips,  many of the constituent rights attached to the concept of a fair trial, for example a lack of rules of evidence and the interrogation of witnesses in the absence of the defendant.<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [59]-[62]</ref> It was suggested that the purpose of the rights codified in article 6 was to prevent this type of conduct, and was not designed to have a major effect on common law systems.<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [14]-[15]</ref>\n\nThe current statutory regime enacted by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was also praised as a \"crafted code\"<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [36]</ref> which ensured that hearsay evidence was properly admitted. It was noted that the current system was heavily influenced by the [[Law Commission]] and by consultation with experts.<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [29]</ref> It was suggested that to introduce the \"sole or decisive rule\" without discussion or consideration would damage this code.\n\nThe court also noted that the rule would create practical difficulties in the criminal system,<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [87]-[90]</ref> and that it was virtually always the case that UK law did exclude evidence that fell within the \"sole or decisive rule\".<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [93]</ref>\n\nAnother observation made was that the rule is [[paradoxical]]; it results in spurious or weak hearsay evidence which would not result in a conviction alone being admitted, while stronger, damning evidence which is likely to achieve a conviction even in the absence of further evidence being excluded. It was suggested that this approach did not make sense, and that good systems tend to exclude weak, not strong evidence.<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [91]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[2009 Judgments of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Hearsay in English Law]]\n*[[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]\n*[[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]\n\n[[Category:2009 in case law]]\n[[Category:2009 in British law]]\n[[Category:Supreme Court of the United Kingdom cases]]\n[[Category:Evidence case law]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox SCOTUK case\n  |Litigants= R v Horncastle (and others)\n  |ArgueDate= 7\u20139 July\n  |ArgueYear= 2009\n  |DecideDate= 9 December\n  |DecideYear= 2009\n  |FullName= R. v Horncastle (Michael Christopher) ,R. v Blackmore (David Lee) ,R. v Marquis (Abijah), R. v Graham (Joseph David)\n  |Neutral Citation= [http://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2009_0073_Judgment.pdf <nowiki>[2009]</nowiki> UKSC 14]\n  |Other Citations= [2010] 2 AC 373, [2010] 2 WLR 47, [2010] 2 All ER 359\n  |Prior= [2009] EWCA Crim 964 (Affirmed in full)\n  |Procedural=\n  |Holding= ''Appeals dismissed'', When hearsay evidence was adduced in a way which complied with the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003|statutory regimes]], there was no breach of [[Right to a fair trial|Article 6]], notwithstanding that the evidence was the \"sole or decisive\" basis of a conviction.\n  |Majority= Lord Phillips (Lady Hale and Lords Brown, Mance, Neuberger, Kerr and Judge concurring)\n  |Dissent=\n  |Area of Law= [[Human Rights]], [[Evidence|Criminal Evidence]]\n  |Applied=\n  |Reversed previous case=\n  |Distinguished previous case= \n  |Reversed=\n  |Distinguished=\n  |Followed=\n  |ECtHR=\n  |ECJ=\n}}\n{{cite bailii|litigants='''R  v Horncastle & Others'''|court=UKSC|year=2009|num=14}} was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] regarding [[hearsay evidence]] and the compatibility of UK hearsay law with the right to a fair trial under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR).<ref>{{cite web|last=Tomlinson|first=Hugh|title=Case Preview: R v Horncastle and others, Hearsay Evidence in Criminal Cases|url=http://ukscblog.com/case-preview-r-v-horncastle-and-others-hearsay-evidence-in-criminal-cases}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ryder|first=Matthew|url=http://ukscblog.com/do-we-want-less-crime-maybe-not|publisher=UKSC Blog |title=Do we want less crime?

It was noted that the current system was heavily influenced by the [[Law Commission]] and by consultation with experts.<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [29]</ref> It was suggested that to introduce the \"sole or decisive rule\" without discussion or consideration would damage this code.\n\nThe court also noted that the rule would create practical difficulties in the criminal system,<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [87]-[90]</ref> and that it was virtually always the case that UK law did exclude evidence that fell within the \"sole or decisive rule\".<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [93]</ref>\n\nAnother observation made was that the rule is [[paradoxical]]; it results in spurious or weak hearsay evidence which would not result in a conviction alone being admitted, while stronger, damning evidence which is likely to achieve a conviction even in the absence of further evidence being excluded. It was suggested that this approach did not make sense, and that good systems tend to exclude weak, not strong evidence.<ref>[2009] UKSC 14 [91]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[2009 Judgments of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Hearsay in English Law]]\n*[[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]\n*[[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]\n\n[[Category:2009 in case law]]\n[[Category:2009 in British law]]\n[[Category:Supreme Court of the United Kingdom cases]]\n[[Category:Evidence case law]]\n", "name_user": "Dl\u00edod\u00f3ir95", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBackground:Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Horncastle"}
