At a local competition felicitation, the local minister, Shriram Singh, proud of him, promises for help whenever needed.\n\nAnand frequently goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to solve a foreign Math journal. One day, the manager finally catches him, and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests him to get his article published in this journal and earn a free lifetime subscription to it. Anand goes to the post-office, where his father Rajendra works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one has been able to solve yet. He then gets featured in the journal for solving the problem, and gets a letter from Professor Richard of the [[University of Cambridge]] to join a program there. But Anand needs money to travel. He and Rajendra go to Shriram but he denies any promise. They both further try to collect money but remain helpless, and get depressed. One day, Rajendra dies of a heart attack. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and financial condition.\n\nHe then sells [[Papadum|papads]] in the city. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, an assistant of the local minister. Lallan takes Anand as a teacher in his coaching centre, Excellence Coaching Centre. There, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. He thinks that these poor kids also have a right to study. Hence, he leaves Excellence and starts a separate tuition for poor kids, in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. He teaches them to learn everything practically and have the concepts cleared in an easy and fun way. All this enrages Lallan, whose centre is facing criticism for not retaining Anand.\n\nIn course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and his mother. Lallan and Shriram plan to have Anand killed so that his kids won't be entering [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]]. Anand is hurt brutally by two of Lallan's henchmen, and is hospitalised, on the verge of death. He tells his students to then use their knowledge to defeat the goons sent by Shriram, while he is being treated. The students, in unity, use their knowledge and defeat the goons and Anand is treated successfully. The students take the IIT exam and all 30 students pass successfully.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as [[Anand Kumar]], a [[Mathematician|mathematician]] who opens a program named Super 30 where he teaches 30 students for [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]] in free cost.\n* [[Mrunal Thakur]] as Supriya, Anand's love interest.\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Rajendra Kumar,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mid-day.com/articles/on-sets-hrithik-roshan-loses-weight-for-his-role-in-super-30/19433190|title=On sets: Hrithik Roshan loses weight for his role in Super 30|date=2018-05-18|work=mid-day|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en}}</ref> Anand's father who dies after suffering from a heart attack.\n* [[Nandish Sandhu|Nandish Singh]] as Pranav Kumar,<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet Nandish Singh, who plays Hrithik Roshan's brother in 'Super 30'|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-meet-nandish-singh-who-plays-hrithik-roshan-s-brother-in-super-30-2589947|website=dnaindia.com|date=2 March 2018|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref> Anand's brother.\n* [[Aditya Shrivastava]] as Lallan Singh, Shri Ram's assistant.\n* [[Sadhana Singh]] as Jayanti Kumar, Anand's mother.\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Shri Ram Singh,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-pankaj-tripathi-to-play-hrithik-roshan-aka-anand-kumar-s-arch-rival-in-super-30-2625091|title=Pankaj Tripathi to play Hrithik Roshan aka Anand Kumar's arch-rival in Super 30|date=2018-06-13|work=dna|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref> a local minister.\n*[[Vijay Varma]] as Fugga Kumar\n* [[Amit Sadh]] as Raghunath<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/amit-sadh-is-super-30s-sutradhar/articleshow/64753466.cms|title=Amit Sadh is the narrator for Hrithik Roshan-starrer Super 30|work=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2018-08-09}}</ref>\n*Sharat Sonu as Haadim Malik, Shriram's secretary.\n*[[Manav Gohil]] as Purushottam\n*Aayush Kumar Shukla as Vinod\n*[[Rahul Raj]] as Kishore\n*Deepali Gautam as Kusum\n*[[Ali Haji (actor)|Ali Haji]] as Prithvi\n*[[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as Bachchi\n*[[Karishma Sharma]] in [[item number]] \"Paisa\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.desimartini.com/news/martini-shots/breakdowns/super-30s-paisa-song-hrithik-roshan-shows-the-power-money-can-give-article112078.htm|title=Super 30\u2019s Paisa Song: Hrithik Roshan Shows The Power Money Can Give!|date=21 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/super-30-new-song-paisa-hrithik-roshan-as-anand-kumar-shows-importance-of-money-1553307-2019-06-21|title=Super 30 new song Paisa: Hrithik Roshan as Anand Kumar shows importance of money|date=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Mrunal Thakur]] was cast opposite Hrithik Roshan in the film.

At a local competition felicitation, the local minister, Shriram Singh, proud of him, promises for help whenever needed.\n\nAnand frequently goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to solve a foreign Math journal. One day, the manager finally catches him, and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests him to get his article published in this journal and earn a free lifetime subscription to it. Anand goes to the post-office, where his father Rajendra works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one has been able to solve yet. He then gets featured in the journal for solving the problem, and gets a letter from Professor Richard of the [[University of Cambridge]] to join a program there. But Anand needs money to travel. He and Rajendra go to Shriram but he denies any promise. They both further try to collect money but remain helpless, and get depressed. One day, Rajendra dies of a heart attack. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and financial condition.\n\nHe then sells [[Papadum|papads]] in the city. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, an assistant of the local minister. Lallan takes Anand as a teacher in his coaching centre, Excellence Coaching Centre. There, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. He thinks that these poor kids also have a right to study. Hence, he leaves Excellence and starts a separate tuition for poor kids, in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. He teaches them to learn everything practically and have the concepts cleared in an easy and fun way. All this enrages Lallan, whose centre is facing criticism for not retaining Anand.\n\nIn course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and his mother. Lallan and Shriram plan to have Anand killed so that his kids won't be entering [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]]. Anand is hurt brutally by two of Lallan's henchmen, and is hospitalised, on the verge of death.

When a company chooses to outsource their payroll, timesheets, wage calculations, creating pay checks, direct deposits, and tax payments can be handled all, or in part, by the payroll company{{cn|date=December 2019}}.\n\nPayroll plays a major role in the internal operations of a business for several reasons. From the perspective of [[Accounting|accounting]], payroll and payroll taxes are subject to laws and regulations. Payroll in the U.S. is subject to federal, state, and local regulations including [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|employee exemptions]], [[Records management|record keeping]], and [[Taxation in the United States|tax requirements]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-payroll-laws-3590.html|title=Employee Payroll Laws|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> Payroll also plays a large role from the [[human resources]] point of view. Payroll errors, such as late or incorrect paychecks, are a sensitive topic that can cause tension between employees and their employer. One requirement to maintaining high [[employee morale]] is that payroll must be paid accurately and in a timely manner because employees are very sensitive to any payroll errors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.501c.com/employees-will-jump-ship-because-of-a-payroll-error/|title=EMPLOYEES WILL JUMP SHIP BECAUSE OF A PAYROLL ERROR|last=Smith|first=Mac|website=501(c) Services|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==Frequency of Payrolls==\nCompanies typically process payroll at regular intervals. This interval varies from company to company and will often differ within the company for different employees for larger companies. The four most common pay frequencies according to research conducted in February 2019 by the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] and the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] are weekly at 33.8%, biweekly at 42.2%, semimonthly at 18.6%, and monthly at 5.4%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ces/publications/length-pay-period.htm|title=Length of pay periods in the Current Employment Statistics survey|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> The other, much less common payroll frequencies, include daily, four-weekly, bimonthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually.  \n\nWeekly payrolls have 52 40-hour pay periods per year and includes one 40 hour work week for overtime calculations. Biweekly payrolls consist of 26 80-hour pay periods per year and consist of two 40 hour work weeks for overtime calculations. Weekly and biweekly payrolls are the most common for [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|nonexempt employees]] because they are the two that allow for the easiest and most transparent overtime calculations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://hirelevel.com/2015/02/24/items-consider-choosing-payroll-frequency/|title=5 Considerations When Choosing a Payroll Frequency|date=2015-02-24|website=HireLevel|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> \n\nSemimonthly payrolls have 24 pay periods per year with two pay dates per month. These pay dates are commonly paid on either the 1st and the 15th day of the month or the 15th and the last day of the month and consist of 86.67 hours per pay period. Monthly payrolls have 12 pay periods per year with a monthly pay date. Each monthly payroll consists of 173.33 hours. Both semimonthly and monthly payrolls are more common for exempt employees that are earning a set salary each payroll. This is because overtime can be confusing and difficult to follow as it may be earned in one week but then falls under a different pay period<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\nDaily payroll is paid to the employee on a day-to-day basis. Four-weekly payrolls are paid once every four weeks, or 13 times per year. Bimonthly payrolls are paid once every two months, or six times per year. These three payroll options are very rarely used, but are used for regular payroll when used. Quarterly payrolls are paid once at the end of each quarter, or four times per year. Semiannually payrolls are paid twice per year and annual payrolls are paid once per year. These three payroll options are mostly used for pay such as bonuses or owner [[profit sharing]] or [[capital gain]] payrolls.\n\nEach employee views their individual payroll on either a physical check stub or via an online portal. When viewing this stub, there are different components that are separate from one another yet all tie together to complete the transaction.\n\nThe first component is gross pay, or [[gross income]]. Gross pay is simply the total amount of compensation that an employee will receive before any deductions or reimbursements are made, including, but not limited to, regular wages, overtime pay, commissions, and bonuses.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/gross-pay.html|title=Which of your friends needs to learn this term?|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The next part of a paycheck is any pretax deductions that may be applicable. These could include insurances, such has health, dental, or life insurance, deductions for certain [[individual retirement account|retirement accounts]], or deductions for [[flexible spending account|FSA]] or [[health savings account|HSA]] accounts. A paycheck also includes taxes. Taxes taken out of the paycheck are collected by the employer and then paid to either the federal, state, or local governments. After the taxes are taken out of payroll, additional adjustments are made in the form of deductions, [[Reimbursement|reimbursements]], and [[Garnishment|garnishments]]. After the payroll is adjusted for the different components, the final total that the employee takes home is known as the [[Net income|net pay]], or net amount, of the check. Net pay is the amount that the employee gets to keep for themselves and spend however they see fit.\n\n== Gross Pay ==\nIn payroll, the gross pay is \"The big number\" on an employee's paycheck. Gross pay, also known as gross income, is the total payment that an employee earns before any deductions or taxes are taken out<ref name=\":2\" />. For employees that are hourly, gross pay is calculated when the rate of hourly pay is multiplied by the total number of regular hours worked. If the employee has overtime hours, these are multiplied by the overtime rate of pay and the two amounts are added together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-gross-pay-and-how-is-it-calculated-398696|title=How to Calculate Gross Pay for All of Your Employees|last=Murray|first=Jean|website=The Balance Small Business|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> Also included in gross pay is any other type of earnings that an employee may have. These may include holiday pay, vacation or sick pay, bonuses, and any miscellaneous pay that the employee may receive.\n\nGross pay for salaried employees is an amount that is set every payroll, unless there are bonuses or other pay involved. If a salaried employee has a salary of $40,000 per year, then their base gross pay will be $40,000 per year, plus any bonuses. For hourly employees, their gross pay can vary from one check to the next. An hourly employee's gross pay amount is their hourly rate times the number of hours they worked, plus any bonuses or miscellaneous pay they may receive.\n\n== Payroll Deductions and Reimbursements ==\nThere are two types of payroll deductions that are taken out of gross pay. The first type are mandatory deductions. These deductions are simply the taxes taken out. The other type of deductions are then considered to be voluntary deductions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancecareers.com/payroll-deductions-1918223|title=Everything You Need to Know About Payroll Deductions|last=Heathfield|first=Susan M.|website=The Balance Careers|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> There are a wide array of voluntary deductions that can be taken out of an employee's gross pay, some of which are taken out before taxes and some being taken out after taxes.  Pre tax deductions are deductions that are taken out of an employee's gross pay amount before it is subject to tax{{cn|date=December 2019}}. Since pre tax deductions are taken from an employee's gross pay before taxes are applied, it also reduces the amount of taxable income for that employee.  \n\nAfter tax deductions are just as they seem. They are deductions that are taken out after taxes have been taken out of an employee's payroll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.zacks.com/pretax-aftertax-deductions-2766.html|website=finance.zacks.com|title=What Are Pre-Tax and After-Tax Deductions?|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Unlike pre-taxed deductions, after tax deductions do not reduce the amount of taxable income for an employee. Like pretax deductions, there are numerous forms of after tax deductions that can be taken out of an employee's check each payroll.\n\n== Payroll taxes ==\nTaxes are one of the most complicated and sensitive aspects of payroll. Various levels of government require employers to withhold various types of income and payroll taxes as well as require the employer to pay their portion of these taxes as well. In the United States, [[Payroll tax|payroll taxes]] and [[Income tax|income taxes]] are two separate taxes, yet they are both associated with payroll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/income-tax-vs-payroll-tax/|title=Income Tax vs Payroll Tax {{!}} Top 5 Differences (with infographics)|date=2018-06-16|website=Wallstreet Mojo|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> Payroll taxes are used to support [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] costs while income taxes are used for other government programs and expenses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://budgeting.thenest.com/difference-between-payroll-tax-income-tax-25574.html|title=What Is the Difference Between Payroll Tax & Income Tax?|last=November 29|first=Catie Watson-Updated|last2=2018|website=budgeting.thenest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref> To differentiate the two when viewing the paystub, payroll taxes will be listed as FICA, social security, and Medi, or Medicare, and income taxes will be the [[Taxation in the United States|Federal]] and [[State income tax|State taxes]] that are withheld.\n\n=== Payroll taxes in the United States ===\nBy law, employers must withhold payroll and income taxes from employees' checks and transfer them to several tax agencies. Employer's are also responsible for paying the employer's share of payroll taxes along with depositing tax withheld from the employees' paychecks, preparing various reconciliation reports, accounting for the payroll expense through their financial reporting, and filing payroll tax returns. The exception to employer taxes is if the employee that is working is an independent contractor or freelancer.\n\n==== Employee Taxes ====\nPayroll taxes that are taken out of an employee's check include Social Security, or FICA, and Medicare taxes. Employees pay 6.2% of their salary to Social Security up to $132,900. Wages earned after an employee has earned gross wages of $132,900 are no longer subject to Social Security taxes. Employees must also pay 1.45% of their earned wages towards Medicare. Wages earned in excess of $200,000 are subject to a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax. This means that every dollar earned over $200,000 is subject to Medicare taxes that total 2.35%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15|title=Publication 15 (2019), (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\nIncome taxes that employee wages are subject to include federal income tax withholding, state income tax withholding, and various local taxes. Federal income tax withholding is different for each employee based on filing status, allowances elected, and total wages earned, which is determined when an employee fills out the federal [[Form W-4|W-4 Form]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/calculate-income-tax-withholding-from-paycheck-398714|title=How to Use the New W-4 Form to Calculate Employee Withholding|last=Murray|first=Jean|website=The Balance Small Business|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Federal income taxes are determined by the federal government and are governed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. [[State income tax|State income tax withholding]] is determined by each state individually and vary in amounts. There are 7 states that have no income taxes and two others that tax only dividend and interest income, which do not involve payroll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-brackets-2019/|title=2019 State Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets|date=2019-03-20|website=Tax Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Depending on the location, sometimes there will also need to be local taxes included in the taxes taken out of each employee's pay check as well. Local income taxes are not nearly as common as federal and state income taxes and most people will not have any local income taxes that have to be paid.\n\n==== Employer Taxes ====\nWhile income taxes are only paid by the employee, payroll taxes are paid not only by the employee, but also by their employer. Payroll taxes that employer's must pay are FICA, Medicare, [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|FUTA]], and [[State unemployment tax act|SUTA]]. The employer portion of the Social Security tax that is paid is the same as the employee portion. Employers must pay a match that is an additional 6.2% of each employee's wages that caps at $132,900 worth of earned wages for each employee. For Medicare, employers must pay a match of 1.45% of all employee wages earned. Contrary to the employee portion, the employer does not pay to pay Additional Medicare Tax Withholding of 0.9% on wages earned above $200,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751|title=Topic No. 751 Social Security and Medicare Withholding Rates {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nEmployers also have two payroll taxes they must pay that the employees do not have to pay. These two taxes are FUTA and SUTA. FUTA, or Federal Unemployment Tax Act, is a tax that is used to fund those employees who have lost their jobs through unemployment compensation.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-the-federal-unemployment-tax-futa-397959|title=When and How to Pay and Report Federal Unemployment Taxes (FUTA)|last=Murray|first=Jean|website=The Balance Small Business|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> Initially, FUTA is taxed at 6% of the first $7,000 earned by each employee. However, most employers receive a credit, or discount, or 5.4% which leaves the effective FUTA tax rate at 0.6% of the first $7,000 earned by each employee<ref name=\":02\" />.\n\n==== Freelance Taxes ====\nThe exceptions to the payroll and income taxes above are found in [[Form W-9|W-9]] employees and [[freelancer|freelancers]]. When an employer hires a freelancer, or W-9 employee, they are not responsible for remitting tax payments for that employee. Freelancers are responsible for paying their Federal and State Income Taxes and both portions of the FICA and Medicare Taxes (12.4% and 2.9% respectively) on all income if total income is over $400.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/file-taxes-for-freelance-work|title=Freelance Taxes 101|website=daveramsey.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> For freelancers or independent contractors that expect to owe at least $1,000 in taxes must pay their taxes quarterly based on the current year's Quarterly Tax Deadlines. In regard to FUTA and SUTA taxes, independent contractors do not pay either of these taxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paychex.com/articles/payroll-taxes/what-is-futa|title=What is FUTA?|date=2019-04-02|website=Paychex|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Wage Garnishments ==\nA wage [[garnishment]] is a court-ordered method of collecting overdue debts that requires employers to withhold money from employee wages and then send it directly to the creditor or to whomever it is that the employee owes money to.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://legaldictionary.net/wage-garnishment/|title=Wage Garnishment - Definition, Examples, Processes|last=Team|first=Content|date=2015-04-15|website=Legal Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Wage garnishments are post-tax deductions, meaning that these mandatory withholdings do not lower an employee's taxable income. Unpaid debts that may result in wage garnishments include credit card bill and medical bills, child support and alimony, federal student loans, and taxy levy's<ref name=\":5\" />. Each of these garnishments have different amounts that they can deduct from an employee's check, with child support being able to take up to 60% of disposable income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.legalzoom.com/can-child-support-majority-paycheck-27058.html|title=Can Child Support Be the Majority of Your Paycheck?|website=info.legalzoom.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n== Net Pay ==\n\nNet pay is simply the total amount that an employee receives from their pay check after all required and voluntary deductions are taken out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-net-pay-1918196|title=The Difference Between Gross Pay and Net Pay|last=Heathfield|first=Susan M.|website=The Balance Careers|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>The formula for determining an employee's net pay would be: Net Pay = Gross Pay - Pretax Deductions - Taxes + Reimbursements - Garnishments - After Tax Deductions. \n==Outsourcing==\nBusinesses may decide to outsource their payroll functions to an outsourcing service like a [[Payroll service bureau]] or a fully managed payroll service. These can normally reduce the costs involved in having payroll trained employees in-house as well as the costs of systems and software needed to process a payroll. Where this may reduce the cost for some companies many will foot a bigger bill to outsource their payroll if they have a special designed payroll program or payouts for their employees.{{cn|date=December 2019}} In many countries, business payrolls are complicated in that [[Payroll tax|taxes]] must be filed consistently and accurately to applicable regulatory agencies. For example, restaurant payrolls which typically include [[Tip (gratuity)|tip]] calculations, deductions, garnishments and other variables, can be difficult to manage especially for new or small business owners.\n\nIn the UK, payroll bureaus will deal with all HM Revenue & Customs inquiries and deal with employee's queries. Payroll bureaus also produce reports for the businesses' account department and payslips for the employees and can also make the payments to the employees if required. As of 6 April 2016, umbrella companies are no longer able to offset travel and subsistence expenses and if they do, they will be deemed liable to reimburse to HMRC any tax relief obtained. Furthermore, recruitment companies and clients may be potentially liable for the unpaid tax.<ref>{{cite web|title=All change for Umbrella Companies from April 2016|url=http://www.fcsa.org.uk/resources/technical-briefings/all-change-for-umbrella-companies-from-april-2016/|website=FCSA|publisher=The Freelancer & Contractor Services Association|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother reason many businesses outsource is because of the ever-increasing complexity of payroll legislation. Annual changes in tax codes, ''Pay as you earn'' ([[PAYE]]) and [[National Insurance]] bands as well as statutory payments and deductions having to go through the payroll often mean there is a lot to keep abreast of in order to maintain compliance with the current legislation.\n\nOn the other hand, businesses may also decide to utilize payroll software to supplement the efforts of a payroll accountant or office instead of hiring more payroll specialists and outsourcing a payroll company. Payroll software base its calculation on entered rate, approved data obtained from other integrated tools like the electronic [[Time clock|Bundy clock]], and other essential digital HR tools. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.nacha.org NACHA \u2013 The Electronic Payments Association]\n*[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15/index.html IRS Publication 15 (2010)(Circular E) Employer's Tax Guide ]\n*[https://www.bls.gov/ United States Bureau of Labor Statistics ]\n\n{{Employment}}\n\n[[Category:Expense]]\n[[Category:Employment compensation]]\n[[Category:Payroll|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||financial firms|Payroll service bureau|the 1961 film|Payroll (film)}}[[File:John Lewis Payslip.png|thumb|right|Handling payroll typically involves sending out [[payslip]]s to employees.]]\nA company's '''payroll''' is the list of employees of that company that are entitled to receive pay and the amounts that each should receive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/payroll|title=Definition of PAYROLL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> Along with the amounts that each employee should receive for time worked or tasks performed, payroll can also refer to a company's records of payments that were previously made to employees, including [[Salary|salaries]] and [[Wage|wages]], [[Bonus payment|bonuses]], and [[Withholding tax|withheld taxes]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eunqTszlDcEC|title=Essentials of Payroll: Management and Accounting|last1=Bragg|first1=Steven M.|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0471456144|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>, or the company's department that calculates and pays out these amounts.

The four most common pay frequencies according to research conducted in February 2019 by the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] and the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] are weekly at 33.8%, biweekly at 42.2%, semimonthly at 18.6%, and monthly at 5.4%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ces/publications/length-pay-period.htm|title=Length of pay periods in the Current Employment Statistics survey|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> The other, much less common payroll frequencies, include daily, four-weekly, bimonthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually.  \n\nWeekly payrolls have 52 40-hour pay periods per year and includes one 40 hour work week for overtime calculations. Biweekly payrolls consist of 26 80-hour pay periods per year and consist of two 40 hour work weeks for overtime calculations. Weekly and biweekly payrolls are the most common for [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|nonexempt employees]] because they are the two that allow for the easiest and most transparent overtime calculations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://hirelevel.com/2015/02/24/items-consider-choosing-payroll-frequency/|title=5 Considerations When Choosing a Payroll Frequency|date=2015-02-24|website=HireLevel|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> \n\nSemimonthly payrolls have 24 pay periods per year with two pay dates per month. These pay dates are commonly paid on either the 1st and the 15th day of the month or the 15th and the last day of the month and consist of 86.67 hours per pay period. Monthly payrolls have 12 pay periods per year with a monthly pay date. Each monthly payroll consists of 173.33 hours. Both semimonthly and monthly payrolls are more common for exempt employees that are earning a set salary each payroll. This is because overtime can be confusing and difficult to follow as it may be earned in one week but then falls under a different pay period<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\nDaily payroll is paid to the employee on a day-to-day basis. Four-weekly payrolls are paid once every four weeks, or 13 times per year. Bimonthly payrolls are paid once every two months, or six times per year. These three payroll options are very rarely used, but are used for regular payroll when used. Quarterly payrolls are paid once at the end of each quarter, or four times per year. Semiannually payrolls are paid twice per year and annual payrolls are paid once per year. These three payroll options are mostly used for pay such as bonuses or owner [[profit sharing]] or [[capital gain]] payrolls.\n==Components of Payroll==\n\nEach employee views their individual payroll on either a physical check stub or via an online portal. When viewing this stub, there are different components that are separate from one another yet all tie together to complete the transaction.\n\nThe first component is gross pay, or [[gross income]]. Gross pay is simply the total amount of compensation that an employee will receive before any deductions or reimbursements are made, including, but not limited to, regular wages, overtime pay, commissions, and bonuses.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/gross-pay.html|title=Which of your friends needs to learn this term?|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The next part of a paycheck is any pretax deductions that may be applicable. These could include insurances, such has health, dental, or life insurance, deductions for certain [[individual retirement account|retirement accounts]], or deductions for [[flexible spending account|FSA]] or [[health savings account|HSA]] accounts. A paycheck also includes taxes. Taxes taken out of the paycheck are collected by the employer and then paid to either the federal, state, or local governments. After the taxes are taken out of payroll, additional adjustments are made in the form of deductions, [[Reimbursement|reimbursements]], and [[Garnishment|garnishments]]. After the payroll is adjusted for the different components, the final total that the employee takes home is known as the [[Net income|net pay]], or net amount, of the check. Net pay is the amount that the employee gets to keep for themselves and spend however they see fit.\n\n== Gross Pay ==\nIn payroll, the gross pay is \"The big number\" on an employee's paycheck. Gross pay, also known as gross income, is the total payment that an employee earns before any deductions or taxes are taken out<ref name=\":2\" />. For employees that are hourly, gross pay is calculated when the rate of hourly pay is multiplied by the total number of regular hours worked. If the employee has overtime hours, these are multiplied by the overtime rate of pay and the two amounts are added together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-gross-pay-and-how-is-it-calculated-398696|title=How to Calculate Gross Pay for All of Your Employees|last=Murray|first=Jean|website=The Balance Small Business|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> Also included in gross pay is any other type of earnings that an employee may have. These may include holiday pay, vacation or sick pay, bonuses, and any miscellaneous pay that the employee may receive.\n\nGross pay for salaried employees is an amount that is set every payroll, unless there are bonuses or other pay involved. If a salaried employee has a salary of $40,000 per year, then their base gross pay will be $40,000 per year, plus any bonuses. For hourly employees, their gross pay can vary from one check to the next. An hourly employee's gross pay amount is their hourly rate times the number of hours they worked, plus any bonuses or miscellaneous pay they may receive.\n\n== Payroll Deductions and Reimbursements ==\nThere are two types of payroll deductions that are taken out of gross pay. The first type are mandatory deductions. These deductions are simply the taxes taken out. The other type of deductions are then considered to be voluntary deductions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancecareers.com/payroll-deductions-1918223|title=Everything You Need to Know About Payroll Deductions|last=Heathfield|first=Susan M.|website=The Balance Careers|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> There are a wide array of voluntary deductions that can be taken out of an employee's gross pay, some of which are taken out before taxes and some being taken out after taxes.  Pre tax deductions are deductions that are taken out of an employee's gross pay amount before it is subject to tax{{cn|date=December 2019}}. Since pre tax deductions are taken from an employee's gross pay before taxes are applied, it also reduces the amount of taxable income for that employee.  \n\nAfter tax deductions are just as they seem. They are deductions that are taken out after taxes have been taken out of an employee's payroll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.zacks.com/pretax-aftertax-deductions-2766.html|website=finance.zacks.com|title=What Are Pre-Tax and After-Tax Deductions?|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Unlike pre-taxed deductions, after tax deductions do not reduce the amount of taxable income for an employee. Like pretax deductions, there are numerous forms of after tax deductions that can be taken out of an employee's check each payroll.\n\n== Payroll taxes ==\nTaxes are one of the most complicated and sensitive aspects of payroll. Various levels of government require employers to withhold various types of income and payroll taxes as well as require the employer to pay their portion of these taxes as well. In the United States, [[Payroll tax|payroll taxes]] and [[Income tax|income taxes]] are two separate taxes, yet they are both associated with payroll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/income-tax-vs-payroll-tax/|title=Income Tax vs Payroll Tax {{!}} Top 5 Differences (with infographics)|date=2018-06-16|website=Wallstreet Mojo|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> Payroll taxes are used to support [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] costs while income taxes are used for other government programs and expenses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://budgeting.thenest.com/difference-between-payroll-tax-income-tax-25574.html|title=What Is the Difference Between Payroll Tax & Income Tax?|last=November 29|first=Catie Watson-Updated|last2=2018|website=budgeting.thenest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref> To differentiate the two when viewing the paystub, payroll taxes will be listed as FICA, social security, and Medi, or Medicare, and income taxes will be the [[Taxation in the United States|Federal]] and [[State income tax|State taxes]] that are withheld.\n\n=== Payroll taxes in the United States ===\nBy law, employers must withhold payroll and income taxes from employees' checks and transfer them to several tax agencies. Employer's are also responsible for paying the employer's share of payroll taxes along with depositing tax withheld from the employees' paychecks, preparing various reconciliation reports, accounting for the payroll expense through their financial reporting, and filing payroll tax returns. The exception to employer taxes is if the employee that is working is an independent contractor or freelancer.\n\n==== Employee Taxes ====\nPayroll taxes that are taken out of an employee's check include Social Security, or FICA, and Medicare taxes. Employees pay 6.2% of their salary to Social Security up to $132,900. Wages earned after an employee has earned gross wages of $132,900 are no longer subject to Social Security taxes. Employees must also pay 1.45% of their earned wages towards Medicare. Wages earned in excess of $200,000 are subject to a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax. This means that every dollar earned over $200,000 is subject to Medicare taxes that total 2.35%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15|title=Publication 15 (2019), (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref>\n\nIncome taxes that employee wages are subject to include federal income tax withholding, state income tax withholding, and various local taxes. Federal income tax withholding is different for each employee based on filing status, allowances elected, and total wages earned, which is determined when an employee fills out the federal [[Form W-4|W-4 Form]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/calculate-income-tax-withholding-from-paycheck-398714|title=How to Use the New W-4 Form to Calculate Employee Withholding|last=Murray|first=Jean|website=The Balance Small Business|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Federal income taxes are determined by the federal government and are governed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. [[State income tax|State income tax withholding]] is determined by each state individually and vary in amounts. There are 7 states that have no income taxes and two others that tax only dividend and interest income, which do not involve payroll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-brackets-2019/|title=2019 State Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets|date=2019-03-20|website=Tax Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Depending on the location, sometimes there will also need to be local taxes included in the taxes taken out of each employee's pay check as well. Local income taxes are not nearly as common as federal and state income taxes and most people will not have any local income taxes that have to be paid.\n\n==== Employer Taxes ====\nWhile income taxes are only paid by the employee, payroll taxes are paid not only by the employee, but also by their employer. Payroll taxes that employer's must pay are FICA, Medicare, [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|FUTA]], and [[State unemployment tax act|SUTA]]. The employer portion of the Social Security tax that is paid is the same as the employee portion. Employers must pay a match that is an additional 6.2% of each employee's wages that caps at $132,900 worth of earned wages for each employee. For Medicare, employers must pay a match of 1.45% of all employee wages earned. Contrary to the employee portion, the employer does not pay to pay Additional Medicare Tax Withholding of 0.9% on wages earned above $200,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751|title=Topic No. 751 Social Security and Medicare Withholding Rates {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nEmployers also have two payroll taxes they must pay that the employees do not have to pay. These two taxes are FUTA and SUTA. FUTA, or Federal Unemployment Tax Act, is a tax that is used to fund those employees who have lost their jobs through unemployment compensation.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-the-federal-unemployment-tax-futa-397959|title=When and How to Pay and Report Federal Unemployment Taxes (FUTA)|last=Murray|first=Jean|website=The Balance Small Business|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> Initially, FUTA is taxed at 6% of the first $7,000 earned by each employee. However, most employers receive a credit, or discount, or 5.4% which leaves the effective FUTA tax rate at 0.6% of the first $7,000 earned by each employee<ref name=\":02\" />.\n\n==== Freelance Taxes ====\nThe exceptions to the payroll and income taxes above are found in [[Form W-9|W-9]] employees and [[freelancer|freelancers]]. When an employer hires a freelancer, or W-9 employee, they are not responsible for remitting tax payments for that employee. Freelancers are responsible for paying their Federal and State Income Taxes and both portions of the FICA and Medicare Taxes (12.4% and 2.9% respectively) on all income if total income is over $400.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/file-taxes-for-freelance-work|title=Freelance Taxes 101|website=daveramsey.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> For freelancers or independent contractors that expect to owe at least $1,000 in taxes must pay their taxes quarterly based on the current year's Quarterly Tax Deadlines. In regard to FUTA and SUTA taxes, independent contractors do not pay either of these taxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paychex.com/articles/payroll-taxes/what-is-futa|title=What is FUTA?|date=2019-04-02|website=Paychex|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Wage Garnishments ==\nA wage [[garnishment]] is a court-ordered method of collecting overdue debts that requires employers to withhold money from employee wages and then send it directly to the creditor or to whomever it is that the employee owes money to.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://legaldictionary.net/wage-garnishment/|title=Wage Garnishment - Definition, Examples, Processes|last=Team|first=Content|date=2015-04-15|website=Legal Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Wage garnishments are post-tax deductions, meaning that these mandatory withholdings do not lower an employee's taxable income. Unpaid debts that may result in wage garnishments include credit card bill and medical bills, child support and alimony, federal student loans, and taxy levy's<ref name=\":5\" />. Each of these garnishments have different amounts that they can deduct from an employee's check, with child support being able to take up to 60% of disposable income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.legalzoom.com/can-child-support-majority-paycheck-27058.html|title=Can Child Support Be the Majority of Your Paycheck?|website=info.legalzoom.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n== Net Pay ==\n\nNet pay is simply the total amount that an employee receives from their pay check after all required and voluntary deductions are taken out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-net-pay-1918196|title=The Difference Between Gross Pay and Net Pay|last=Heathfield|first=Susan M.|website=The Balance Careers|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>The formula for determining an employee's net pay would be: Net Pay = Gross Pay - Pretax Deductions - Taxes + Reimbursements - Garnishments - After Tax Deductions. \n==Outsourcing==\nBusinesses may decide to outsource their payroll functions to an outsourcing service like a [[Payroll service bureau]] or a fully managed payroll service. These can normally reduce the costs involved in having payroll trained employees in-house as well as the costs of systems and software needed to process a payroll. Where this may reduce the cost for some companies many will foot a bigger bill to outsource their payroll if they have a special designed payroll program or payouts for their employees.{{cn|date=December 2019}} In many countries, business payrolls are complicated in that [[Payroll tax|taxes]] must be filed consistently and accurately to applicable regulatory agencies. For example, restaurant payrolls which typically include [[Tip (gratuity)|tip]] calculations, deductions, garnishments and other variables, can be difficult to manage especially for new or small business owners.\n\nIn the UK, payroll bureaus will deal with all HM Revenue & Customs inquiries and deal with employee's queries. Payroll bureaus also produce reports for the businesses' account department and payslips for the employees and can also make the payments to the employees if required. As of 6 April 2016, umbrella companies are no longer able to offset travel and subsistence expenses and if they do, they will be deemed liable to reimburse to HMRC any tax relief obtained. Furthermore, recruitment companies and clients may be potentially liable for the unpaid tax.<ref>{{cite web|title=All change for Umbrella Companies from April 2016|url=http://www.fcsa.org.uk/resources/technical-briefings/all-change-for-umbrella-companies-from-april-2016/|website=FCSA|publisher=The Freelancer & Contractor Services Association|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother reason many businesses outsource is because of the ever-increasing complexity of payroll legislation. Annual changes in tax codes, ''Pay as you earn'' ([[PAYE]]) and [[National Insurance]] bands as well as statutory payments and deductions having to go through the payroll often mean there is a lot to keep abreast of in order to maintain compliance with the current legislation.\n\nOn the other hand, businesses may also decide to utilize payroll software to supplement the efforts of a payroll accountant or office instead of hiring more payroll specialists and outsourcing a payroll company. Payroll software base its calculation on entered rate, approved data obtained from other integrated tools like the electronic [[Time clock|Bundy clock]], and other essential digital HR tools. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.nacha.org NACHA \u2013 The Electronic Payments Association]\n*[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15/index.html IRS Publication 15 (2010)(Circular E) Employer's Tax Guide ]\n*[https://www.bls.gov/ United States Bureau of Labor Statistics ]\n\n{{Employment}}\n\n[[Category:Expense]]\n[[Category:Employment compensation]]\n[[Category:Payroll|*]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4053:405:ee77:3472:cc54:ab91:40f1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll"}

The compromise should offer a larger repayment towards the creditor's debt than could otherwise be expected were the Debtor to be made bankrupt.

Many companies\u2019 heavily invest into accountancy and rely on [[insolvency]] solutions to prevent debt from being left aside.\n\n==Default==\n{{main|Default (finance)}}\nDefault occurs when the debtor has not met its legal obligations according to the debt contract, e.g.- it has not made a scheduled payment, or has violated a [[loan covenant|covenant]] in the debt contract. Default may occur if the debtor is either unwilling or unable to pay its [[debt]]. This can occur with all debt obligations including [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s, [[loan]]s, and [[promissory note]]s.<ref name=\"Default\">{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp|title=Default|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref>\n\nIf the debt owed becomes beyond the possibility of repayment, the debtor faces [[insolvency]] or [[bankruptcy]]; in the [[United Kingdom]] and some states of the [[United States]] until the mid-19th century, debtors could be imprisoned in [[debtor's prison]]s, while in some countries such as [[Greece]] debtors are still imprisoned.\n\n==Debtor in Bankruptcy and Individual Voluntary Arrangements==\nAn [[Individual Voluntary Arrangement]] is a legally binding arrangement supervised by a licensed [[Insolvency Practitioner]], the purpose of which is to enable an individual, sole trader or Partner (\"the Debtor\") to reach a compromise with his creditors and avoid the consequences of bankruptcy. The compromise should offer a larger repayment towards the creditor's debt than could otherwise be expected were the Debtor to be made bankrupt. This is often facilitated by the Debtor making contributions to the arrangement from his income over a designated period or from a third party contribution or other source that would not ordinarily be available to a Trustee in [[Bankruptcy]].<ref name=\"A guide to individual voluntary agreements\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mw-w.com/a-guide-to-individual-voluntary-arrangements.html|title=A guide to individual voluntary agreements|publisher=McTear Williams & Wood|accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\nIn the Latin version of the [[Lord's Prayer]], the words ''Et dimitte nobis debita nostra/Sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris'', the words ''Debtor'' and ''Debt'' are sometimes translated as ''Sinner'' and ''Sin''. This particular understanding of sin, as a form of debt that humanity inherits, is related to the soteriological theory of [[substitutionary atonement]], which states that Jesus died on the cross as a propitiation, or substitute, for sinners.<ref name=\"Debt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/debt|title=Debt|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Administration order]]\n*[[Administrative receivership]]\n*[[Bankruptcy]]\n*[[Creditor's rights]]\n*[[Debtors' prison]]\n*[[Liquidation]]\n*[[Simplified Individual Voluntary Arrangement]]\n*[[Protected Trust Deed]] (only available in Scotland)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090429115235/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/ Insolvency Service website]\n*[http://www.insolvency-practitioners.org.uk/ Insolvency Practitioners Association website]\n*[http://www.insolvencynews.com/ Insolvency News]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Debt]]\n", "name_user": "Commuter3", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add alternate spelling \"debitor\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor"}

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.<ref name=billzebub/> This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.<ref name=billzebub/> Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and Emperor's ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').\n\n=== Production ===\nThe earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} giving their recordings a distinctive \"lo-fi\" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.<ref name=chronicles/><ref name=murdermusic/> Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more \"raw\" or \"cold\".<ref name=murdermusic/> A well-known example of this approach is on the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]], a band who Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says \"represent the [[DIY]] aspect of black metal.\"<ref name=murdermusic/> In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]]. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.<ref name=murdermusic/> Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, \"Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction\".<ref name=guardian/>\n\n== History ==\nThe conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a \"first wave\", and that a \"second wave\" was begun by the early Norwegian scene, especially by Mayhem vocalist, Dead's suicide;<ref>Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.</ref> Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide;{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=39}} and Darkthrone's album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.<ref name=paganfront>[[Hendrik M\u00f6bus]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Jon \"Metalion\" Kristiansen: [https://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann: ''Darkthrone''.

They were often [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] bands.<ref name=sam/><ref>{{cite book |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |title=Metal: The Definitive Guide |page=208}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"black metal\" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,<ref name=murdermusic/> the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.\n\nAnother major influence on black metal was the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. [[Quorthon]]), created \"the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal\".{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that later became a common trait.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return\u2026\u2026]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988).

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.<ref name=billzebub/> This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.<ref name=billzebub/> Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and Emperor's ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').\n\n=== Production ===\nThe earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} giving their recordings a distinctive \"lo-fi\" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.<ref name=chronicles/><ref name=murdermusic/> Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more \"raw\" or \"cold\".<ref name=murdermusic/> A well-known example of this approach is on the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]], a band who Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says \"represent the [[DIY]] aspect of black metal.\"<ref name=murdermusic/> In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]]. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.<ref name=murdermusic/> Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, \"Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction\".<ref name=guardian/>\n\n== History ==\nThe conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a \"first wave\", and that a \"second wave\" was begun by the early Norwegian scene, especially by Mayhem vocalist, Dead's suicide;<ref>Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.</ref> Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide;{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=39}} and Darkthrone's album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.<ref name=paganfront>[[Hendrik M\u00f6bus]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Jon \"Metalion\" Kristiansen: [https://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.</ref><ref>Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann: ''Darkthrone''.

Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,<ref name=murdermusic/> the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.\n\nAnother major influence on black metal was the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. [[Quorthon]]), created \"the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal\".{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that later became a common trait.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return\u2026\u2026]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988).

However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and rather used Satanic themes to provoke controversy or gain attention. One of the few exceptions was [[Mercyful Fate]] singer and [[Church of Satan]] member [[King Diamond]], whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls \"one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for [[shock value]]\".{{sfn|Moynihan|S\u00f8derlind|2003|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Gorgoroth by Christian Misje.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Video shoot for \"Carving a Giant\" by Gorgoroth, which features mock crucifixions]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, many Norwegian black-metallers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} They attacked the Church of Satan for its \"freedom and life-loving\" views;<ref name=killyourself2>Esa Lahdenpera: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html ''Northern Black Metal Legends''].

It provided 140,000 immigrant visas ([[Green card|green cards]]) annually for employment-based immigration and mandated that foreign nationals of no country shall receive more than 7% of the available visas in each category in any given year, with the exception of excess unused visas. However, this is not the case for the [[H-1B visa]] system. As such, Indian nationals that for years have received the majority of H-1B visas,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/BAHA/h-1b-2007-2017-trend-tables.pdf|title=Number of H-1B Petition Filings FY2007 - FY2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.uscis.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> despite receiving about 20% of the annual Employment-based green cards<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2018AnnualReport/FY18AnnualReport%20-%20TableV.pdf|title=Immigrant Visas Issued and Adjustments of Status Subject to Numerical Limitations Fiscal Year 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=www.travel.state.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook|title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics|date=2009-07-09|website=Department of Homeland Security|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> have to wait decades before receiving one. A similar situation holds for immigrants applying for family-based green cards where millions of people, mostly from the Philippines, Mexico, India, and China, have to wait years before receiving a green card. The fundamental cause of the green card backlog is that annual demand for green cards is much higher than ones available annually and not, as some may assume, the per-country caps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@goodarzm/what-are-the-implications-of-the-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act-of-2019-e8dce7b2ab6d|title=What are the Implications of the \u201cFairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019\u201d (H.R.1044/S.386)?|last=Mehr|first=Goodarz|date=2019-08-29|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> It is estimated that currently there are 4.7 million people waiting in the green card backlog, 3.9 million of whom are waiting for a family-based green card and the rest waiting for an employment-based green card.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/immigration-wait-times-quotas-have-doubled-green-card-backlogs-are-long|title=Immigration Wait Times from Quotas Have Doubled: Green Card Backlogs Are Long, Growing, and Inequitable|date=2019-06-18|website=Cato Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Provisions ==\nThe bill would, after a five-year transition period, remove the per-country caps for employment-based green cards and increase the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7% to 15%, while increasing the number of total available green cards.

As such, Indian nationals that for years have received the majority of H-1B visas,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/BAHA/h-1b-2007-2017-trend-tables.pdf|title=Number of H-1B Petition Filings FY2007 - FY2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.uscis.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> despite receiving about 20% of the annual Employment-based green cards<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2018AnnualReport/FY18AnnualReport%20-%20TableV.pdf|title=Immigrant Visas Issued and Adjustments of Status Subject to Numerical Limitations Fiscal Year 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=www.travel.state.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook|title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics|date=2009-07-09|website=Department of Homeland Security|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> have to wait decades before receiving one. A similar situation holds for immigrants applying for family-based green cards where millions of people, mostly from the Philippines, Mexico, India, and China, have to wait years before receiving a green card. The fundamental cause of the green card backlog is that annual demand for green cards is much higher than ones available annually and not, as some may assume, the per-country caps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@goodarzm/what-are-the-implications-of-the-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act-of-2019-e8dce7b2ab6d|title=What are the Implications of the \u201cFairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019\u201d (H.R.1044/S.386)?|last=Mehr|first=Goodarz|date=2019-08-29|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> It is estimated that currently there are 4.7 million people waiting in the green card backlog, 3.9 million of whom are waiting for a family-based green card and the rest waiting for an employment-based green card.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/immigration-wait-times-quotas-have-doubled-green-card-backlogs-are-long|title=Immigration Wait Times from Quotas Have Doubled: Green Card Backlogs Are Long, Growing, and Inequitable|date=2019-06-18|website=Cato Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Provisions ==\nThe bill would, after a five-year transition period, remove the per-country caps for employment-based green cards and increase the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7% to 15%, while increasing the number of total available green cards.
