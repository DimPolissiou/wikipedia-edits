Coach soon becomes concerned that El Matador is being distracted by the big city lights, and moves the team into a cheap motel on the outskirts of town.

But in Las Vegas... all is NOT what it seems!\n\n64    '''\"Total Replay\"'''\n\nDays before the semi-final against Invincible United, Supa Strikas have been getting a new practice method by using Prof's latest machine, which brings you to a virtual reality world where you can battle the world's toughest soccer legends!

On the way they realise that El Matador's live stream, Klaus's constant bathroom breaks, and a creepy Grimm FC gift shop are the least of their worries, as the forests of Feratuvia hold something much more terrifyng...\n\n76. '''\"Training Daze\"'''\n\nAfter Supa Strikas shock loss to Invincible United. Coach goes berserk. But when somebody hacks the secret training Centre and Toni  Vern sets up a food stand. Something doesn't taste right?\n\n77. '''\"Cool Aid\"'''                                                            \n\nVince pays DJ Midas Touch to bring Cool Joe off his game. Shakes gets locked in the recording room. Klaus enters the music industry. Can Shakes help Cool Joe get back to his old self? And will Supa Strikas prevail against Invincible United?\n\n\n78.

{"title_page": "Bristol Yachts", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:Bristol Healing.jpg|thumb|Bristol under full sail]]\n'''Bristol Yachts''' was a [[United States]]-based company which was among the first commercially successful production fiberglass [[sailboat]] boat builders. The company was founded in 1966 and closed in 1997.\n\n==History==\nBristol Yacht Company was founded by Clinton Pearson. Clint and his cousin Everett Pearson began building fiberglass dinghies in 1955 in their garage on County Street in Seekonk, MA, just over the MA/RI state line.  Within a year the newly founded [[Pearson Yachts]] employed hundreds of people. Fast corporate expansion resulted in cash flow problems, so the cousins raised capital by selling equity in Pearson to Grumman Allied Industries in 1961.  Clinton left in 1964 and bought out a troubled sailboat-maker, Sailstar, in [[West Warwick]], [[Rhode Island]], and moved into the abandoned Herreshoff boatyard.  [[Carl Alberg]] designed the company's first boat, the Bristol 27. Clinton changed the company\u2019s name to Bristol Yacht Company in 1966, and the Sailstar brand was phased out. The boat yard was eventually located on Popasquash Road, in Bristol, Rhode Island. The facilities included a giant barn on land owned by Clinton and where his home was located as well. Across the road from the barn was a small marina and travellift. Due to bankruptcy the company closed in 1997.\n\n==Models and designers==\nEarly Bristol models aimed at the mass market and often were cutaway full [[keel]] or keel-centerboard designs. Among the first models were the Alberg designed 27 and the Herreshoff designed 29.\n[[Halsey Chase Herreshoff|Halsey Herreshoff]], the grandson of the brilliant yacht designer and innovator [[Nathanael Herreshoff]] and a renowned yacht designer in his own right, designed a number of first generation models, including the Bristol 22 \u201cCaravel\u201d, the 26 \"Courier\", 28, 29, 30, 33 and 34. His early designs made the most of the CCA rules with cutaway keels and long overhangs. His later designs were generally performance oriented fin and skeg or fin keel designs. Carl Alberg was responsible for the first generation Bristol models Corinthian 19 (one of the original Sailstar models that Bristol took over) and the Bristol 27 (a boat very similar in design to the [[Pearson Triton|Pearson Triton 28]], also an Alberg design). [[Paul Coble (Naval Architect)|Paul Coble]] designed the Corsair (another Sailstar model later identified as the Bristol 24)--a very stout and roomy 24 footer. The Bristol 32 and 39 (40) were designed by [[Ted Hood]].\n\nEarly Bristols offered a lot for their modest prices, including encapsulated lead keels on many models, but with iron punchings and concrete on many of the boats that joined the Bristol line when Bristol acquired the molds from Sailstar. The boats features large galleys for their day, large cockpits with seats you could sleep on, fiberglass cabin headliners on some models, and interiors with a nice blend of white formica and mahogany trim. The early boats had keel-hung rudders, cut away full keels and were moderately stout boats with an relatively comfortable motion for their day. The second generation Bristol yachts carried a decimal and a repeat of the second model number (27.7, 29.9, 31.1, 33.3, 35.5, 38.8, 41.1, 43.3, 45.5, 47.7, 51.1). They came from the design team of [[Ted Hood]], an America's Cup designer. Hood designs generally were [[centerboard]] boats which aimed for performance without deep draft, although some models offered the option of a deeper fixed keel. The hull designs were a development of Ted Hood's \"whale bottom\" delta hull form, with a steep deadrise allowing the ballast to be placed low in the hull (compensating for the lack of ballast in the centreboard), and improving interior space. This hull design is known for its comfortable motion in a seaway. Several of the second generation boats were designed by Dieter Empacher, who, at the time, was employed by Hood design group.\n\nLater on, numerous options were available making the boats essentially semi-custom. For example, in 1985 the options list included a choice of interior wood, counter material, cabin floor, exterior rubbing rails, higher/deeper toe rails, teak swim ladder, a choice of engines, instrumentation options, and so on. Bristols were typically built more heavily than many comparable production sailboats, with features such as skeg-hung rudders, keel-stepped masts, fully encapsulated keel ballast, interior cabinetry bonded to the hull for strength, heavy-duty bronze seacocks, and heavy fibreglass lay-up. Most Bristols can be raced using the [[PHRF]] handicap system, despite being designed more for cruising and comfort.\n\nThe company built, or at least advertised, two models of motor yacht, one designated the 42 foot Bristol Offshore Trawler and the other advertised as a 38 foot model available in both an aft cabin and sedan configuration. Bristol trawlers were sold during the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Bristol Yacht Co. laid up the hull for the early 42 foot model which was a round-bilge design by the famed Eldridge-McGinnis naval architecture firm. The 42 foot model displaced somewhere between 26 and 30,000 pounds. The hulls were shipped off to another builder for epoxy laminated plywood decks and interiors. Production of the Bristol trawlers shifted to India during the 1970s, adding provenance to the Bristol-built trawlers. Numerous Bristol 42 trawlers remain in service as of November 2011.\n\nThe company began building custom designed sailboats in the 50-plus foot range in the early 1990s but eventually folded in 1997. The yard built more than 4400 boats, the largest being 72' long.\n\n==Notable voyages and sailors==\nBill Wolfram, born 1950, sailed a Bristol 22, We-Tu, from Port Townsend, Washington, to Australia and back, around 2002-2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill's Story|url=http://www.laurig.com/articles/bill/frameset.html|accessdate=19 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624161553/http://laurig.com/articles/bill/frameset.html|archivedate=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nJohn Atkisson sailed his Bristol 32 \"Kestrel\" in the spring of 2005 singlehanded from New England to Britain, spent time cruising in Europe and eventually round-tripping back to the US.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Bart|title=John Atkisson; After law career, he sailed across Atlantic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/06/AR2010030602169.html|accessdate=19 April 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=7 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nKen and Katie Stuber, sailed their 1980 Bristol 32 \"Sand Dollar\", hull #298, most of the way around the world, departing San Francisco in 2008 and arriving in Florida in 2016 via Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, the Philippines, Borneo, Southeast Asia, Thailand, the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, and the West Indies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Joe|date=November/December 2018|title=Bristol 32 A lovely full-keel cruiser in the classic CCA style|url=|journal=Good Old Boat|volume=Issue 123|pages=8-13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=sanddollarn4ks.blogspot.com|title=Ken and Katie's Voyages Aboard Sand Dollar|last=Stuber|first=Katie|date=|website=Ken and Katie's Voyages Aboard Sand Dollar|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n==Boats==\n*[[Bristol 29.9]]\n*[[Bristol 39]]\n*[[Bristol 40]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n{{Bristol Yachts}}\n\n[[Category:American boat builders]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:Bristol Healing.jpg|thumb|Bristol under full sail]]\n'''Bristol Yachts''' was a [[United States]]-based company which was among the first commercially successful production fiberglass [[sailboat]] boat builders.

In addition to tailored skirts, women wore [[stiletto heel]] shoes and suits with short boxy jackets, and oversized buttons. Simple, geometric dresses, known as shifts, were also in style. For evening wear, full-skirted evening gowns were worn; these often had a low [[d\u00e9colletage]] and close-fitting waists. For casual wear, [[Capri pants|capri trousers]] were the fashion for women and girls.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n====Bikini====\n[[File:Beach Party Annette Funicello Frankie Avalon Mid-1960s.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Publicity photo of [[Frankie Avalon]] and [[Annette Funicello]] for [[Beach party film|Beach Party]] films (c. 1960s).

Traditionally, trousers had been viewed by western society as masculine, but by the early 1960s, it had become acceptable for women to wear them everyday. These included [[Levi Strauss]] jeans, which had previously been considered blue collar wear, and \"stretch\" [[drainpipe jeans]] with [[elastane]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20181221000740/https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/FD77/production/_93778846_2131980480_a774c5e5f1_o.jpg 1962 Sears catalog]</ref> Women's trousers came in a variety of styles: narrow, wide, below the knee, above the ankle, and eventually mid thigh.

It was heavily influenced by the [[Space Race]] of the [[Cold War]], in addition to popular [[science fiction]] [[paperback]]s, films and television series such as ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Dan Dare]]'', or ''[[Lost In Space]]''.

Synthetic material was also popular with space age fashion designers. After the Second World War, fabrics like nylon, corfam, orlon, terylene, lurex and spandex were promoted as cheap, easy to dry, and wrinkle-free. The synthetic fabrics of the 1960s allowed space age fashion designers to design garments with bold shapes and a plastic texture.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Sixties fashion: From less is more to youthquake.|last=Walford|first=Johnathan|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2013|isbn=9780500516935|location=London|pages=110}}</ref> Non-cloth material, such as [[polyester]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], became popular in clothing and accessories as well. For daytime outerwear, short plastic raincoats, colourful [[swing coats]] and dyed fake-furs were popular for young women. In 1966, the [[Nehru jacket]] arrived on the fashion scene, and was worn by both sexes. Suits were very diverse in color but were, for the first time ever, fitted and very slim. Waistlines for women were left unmarked and hemlines were getting shorter and shorter.\n\n[[File:Brigitte Bardot.jpg|thumb|left|French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] wearing a transparent top and a [[feather boa]], 1968]]\nFootwear for women included low-heeled sandals and kitten-heeled pumps, as well as the trendy white [[go-go boots]].

These were known as \"Beatle boots\" and were widely copied by young men in Britain.\n\nThe French designer [[Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges]] was particularly influential in the development of space age fashion. The \"space look\" he introduced in the spring of 1964 included trouser suits, goggles, box-shaped dresses with high skirts, and go-go boots.

The miniskirt changed fashion forever.\n\nThe definition of a miniskirt is a skirt with a hemline that is generally between 6 and 7 inches above the knees. Early references to the miniskirt from the Wyoming newspaper ''The Billings Gazette'', described the miniskirt as a controversial item that was produced in Mexico City.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} During the 1950s, the miniskirt began appearing in [[science fiction film]]s like [[Flight to Mars (film)|''Flight to Mars'']] and ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''<ref>Parks, C. (2015, March 23). ''The Miniskirt: An Evolution From The '60s To Now''. Retrieved October 30, 2016, from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/23/mini-skirt-evolution_n_6894040.html</ref>\n\n[[Mary Quant]] and [[Andre Courreges]] both contributed to the invention of the miniskirt during the 1960s. [[Mary Quant]], A British designer, was one of the pioneers of the miniskirt during 1960. She named the skirt after her favorite car, the Mini Cooper. Quant introduced her design in the mid-60s at her London boutique, Bazaar. She has said: \" We wanted to increase the availability of fun for everyone. We felt that expensive things were almost immoral and the New Look was totally irrelevant to us.\" Miniskirts became popular in London and Paris and the term \"Chelsea Look\" was coined.<ref>Paula Reed. (2012). In ''Fifty Fashion Looks that Changed the 1960s'' (pp. 30\u201331). England: Alison Starling.</ref>\n\n[[Andre Courreges]] was a French fashion designer who also began experimenting with hemlines in the early 1960s. He started to show space-age dresses that hit above the knee in late 1964. His designs were more structured and sophisticated than Quant's design.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This made the miniskirt more acceptable to the French public. His clothes represented a couture version of the \"[[Youthquake (movement)|Youthquake]]\" street style and heralded the arrival of the \"moon girl\" look.<ref>Koda, H. (2010). ''100 Dresses: The Costume Institute'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art. S.l.: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\nAs teen culture became stronger, the term \"[[Youthquake (movement)|Youthquake]]\" came to mean the power of young people. This was unprecedented before the 1960s. Before [[World War II]], teenagers dressed and acted like their parents. Many settled down and began raising families when they were young, normally right after high school. They were often expected to work and assist their families financially. Therefore, youth culture begins to develop only after World War II, when the advancement of many technologies and stricter child labor laws became mainstream. Teenagers during this period had more time to enjoy their youth, and the freedom to create their own culture separate from their parents. Teens soon began establishing their own identities and communities, with their own views and ideas, breaking away from the traditions of their parents.<ref>Blackman, C. (2012). ''100 Years of Fashion''. London: Laurence King Pub.</ref> The fabulous \"little girl\" look was introduced to USA\u2014styling with Bobbie Brooks, bows, patterned knee socks and mini skirts. The miniskirt and the \"little girl\" look that accompanied it reflect a revolutionary shift in the way people dress. Instead of younger generations dressing like adults, they became inspired by childlike dress.<ref>Nectara, J (2012, July 13). \"The Miniskirt \u2013 A Short History.\" Retrieved October 30, 2016, from http://www.fashionavecpassion.com/the-miniskirt-a-short-history/</ref>\n\n[[Second-wave feminism]] made the miniskirt popular. Women had entered the professional workforce in larger numbers during World War II and many women soon found they craved a career and life outside the home.<ref>Bourne, L.

Flared trousers and bell bottoms appeared in 1964 as an alternative to [[capri pants]], and led the way to the hippie period introduced in the 1960s. Bell bottoms were usually worn with chiffon blouses, polo-necked ribbed sweaters or tops that bared the midriff. These were made in a variety of materials including heavy denims, silks, and even elasticated fabrics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tarrant|first=Naomi|title=The Development of Costume|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=88}}</ref> Variations of [[polyester]] were worn along with acrylics.<ref name=\"retrowow2\" /> A popular look for females was the suede mini-skirt worn with a French polo-neck top, square-toed boots, and [[Newsboy cap]] or [[beret]]. This style was also popular in the early 2000s.\n\nWomen were inspired by the top models of the day which included [[Twiggy]], [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Colleen Corby]], [[Penelope Tree]], and [[Veruschka]]. Velvet mini dresses with lace-collars and matching cuffs, wide tent dresses and [[culottes]] pushed aside the geometric shift. False eyelashes were in vogue, as was pale lipstick.  Hemlines kept rising, and by 1968 they had reached well above mid-thigh. These were known as \"micro-minis\". This was when the \"angel dress\" first made its appearance on the fashion scene. A micro-mini dress with a flared skirt and long, wide trumpet sleeves, it was usually worn with patterned tights, and was often made of crocheted lace, velvet, chiffon or sometimes cotton with a [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] print. The cowled-neck \"monk dress\" was another religion-inspired alternative; the cowl could be pulled up to be worn over the head. For evening wear, skimpy chiffon baby-doll dresses with spaghetti-straps were popular, as well as the \"cocktail dress\", which was a close-fitting sheath, usually covered in lace with matching long sleeves.<ref>Contini, p. 317</ref> [[Feather boa]]s were occasionally worn. Famous celebrities associated with marketing the miniskirt included: [[Twiggy]]; model [[Jean Shrimpton]], who attended an event in the Melbourne Cup Carnival in Australia wearing a miniskirt in 1965; [[Goldie Hawn]], who appeared on ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'' with her mini skirt in 1967;  and [[Jackie Kennedy]], who wore a short white pleated Valentino dress when she married Aristotle Onassis in 1968.\n\n====The Single Girl====\n[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] was a model who reflected the ideal of the single girl.]]\nWriter, [[Helen Gurley Brown]], wrote [[Sex and the Single Girl]] in 1962. This book acted as a guide for women of any marital status to take control of their own lives financially as well as emotionally.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex and the Single Girl|last=Brown|first=Helen Gurley|publisher=Bernard Geis Associates|year=1962|isbn=9781569802526|location=|pages=}}</ref> This book was revolutionary since it encouraged sex before marriage; something that was historically looked down upon. With the high success of this book, a pathway was set for media to also encourage this behavior.

The Single Girl represented 'movement'. She was young, single, active, and economically self-sufficient. To represent this new Single Girl feminine ideal, many 1960s photographers photographed models outside\u2014often having them walk or run in fashion shoots. Models in the 1960s also promoted sports wear, which reflected the modern fascination with speed and the quickening pace of the 1960s urban life. Although the Single Girl was economically, socially and emotionally self-sufficient, the ideal body form was difficult for many to achieve. Therefore, women were constrained by diet restrictions that seemed to contradict the image of the empowered 1960s Single Girl.<ref name=\"Radner 2001 183\u2013197\">{{cite book|last=Radner|first=Hilary|title=Body Dressing|year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=1859734448|pages=183\u2013197|editor=Joanne Entwistle and Elizabeth B. Wilson|chapter=Embodying the Single Girl in the 1960s}}</ref> Fashion photographers also photographed the Single Girl wearing business wear, calling her the Working Girl. The Working Girl motif represented another shift for the modern, fashionable woman. Unlike earlier periods, characterized by formal evening gowns and the European look, the 1960s Working Girl popularized day wear and \"working clothing\". New ready to wear lines replaced individualized formal couture fashion. The Working Girl created an image of a new, independent woman who has control over her body.<ref name=\"Radner 2001 183\u2013197\" />\n\nThere was a new emphasis on [[ready-to-wear]] and personal style.

She emerged in the mid-sixties, and her defining characteristic is the iconic miniskirt. \"Dolly Girls\" also sported long hair, slightly teased, of course, and childish-looking clothing. Clothes were worn tight fitting, sometimes even purchased from a children's section. Dresses were often embellished with lace, ribbons, and other frills; the look was topped off with light colored tights. Crocheted clothing also took off within this specific style.<ref>Bond, David (1981). ''The Guinness Guide to 20th Century Fashion.''

Hosiery manufacturers of the time like Mary Quant (who founded Pamela Mann Legwear) combined the \"Flower Power\" style of dress and the [[Pop Art]] school of design to create fashion tights that would appeal to a female audience that enjoyed [[psychedelia]].<ref>\n[http://www.uktights.com/article/13/hosiery-trends-over-the-decades Hosiery Trends Over The Decades]</ref>\nPonchos, moccasins, love beads, peace signs, medallion necklaces, chain belts, polka dot-printed fabrics, and long, puffed \"bubble\" sleeves were popular fashions in the late 1960s. Both men and women wore frayed bell-bottomed jeans, tie-dyed shirts, work shirts, Jesus sandals, and headbands. Women would often go barefoot and some went braless. The idea of multiculturalism also became very popular; a lot of style inspiration was drawn from traditional clothing in Nepal, India, Bali, Morocco and African countries. Because inspiration was being drawn from all over the world, there was increasing separation of style; clothing pieces often had similar elements and created similar silhouettes, but there was no real \"uniform\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Miles|first=Barry|title=Hippie|year=2004|publisher=Sterling|isbn=1402714424}}</ref>\n\nFringed buck-skin vests, flowing caftans, the \"lounging\" or \"hostess\" pajamas were also popular. \"Hostess\" pajamas consisted of a tunic top over floor-length culottes, usually made of polyester or chiffon. Long maxi coats, often belted and lined in sheepskin, appeared at the close of the decade. [[Animal prints]] were popular for women in the autumn and winter of 1969.

[[Pendleton jacket]]s were common due to their cheapness, warmth and durability. Design wise the surf jacket suited popularly with nonchalance, warmth for coastal Californian climate, and utility pockets for surf wax and VW car keys, two surf essentials (Pendleton Woolen Mills).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.heddels.com/2016/09/pendleton-woolen-mills-an-unlikely-surf-icon/|title=Pendleton Woolen Mills - An Unlikely Surf Icon|date=2016-09-12|work=Heddels|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Pendleton Surf Jacket expanded upon Fifties pop cultural fashions, however new in its relaxed, intangibly cool vibe.

Surf styles mainstreamed into fashion when [[Soul surfer|Soul Surfers]] wanted to make livings in surfing associated careers.

For a surfer though, it is curious why a woolen plaid jacket paired with [[Ugg boots|UGG boots]], and not the [[Boardshorts|board-short]] or [[aloha shirt]] identified the surfer. The Pendleton ''[[Tartan|plaid]]'', originally worn by [[Lumberjack|logger]]s, hunters and fishermen, was a common item of [[casual wear]] for American men of all classes before the [[British invasion]]. For the youth of the 60s, however, the plaid Pendleton signified [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and tribal seamen style translated from Welsh folklore, rebellious Scots [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]], and rugged American frontiersmen (Bowe).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gearpatrol.com/2014/10/02/history-flannel/|title=The History of Flannel - Gear Patrol|date=2014-10-02|work=Gear Patrol|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Sixties invented the Californian Cool style, by relaxing style to escape [[Cold War]] meltdowns with [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] fascinations, bridging the macho 1950s teen towards 1960s Hippie style. The Cold War's tense political context conceived Surf Fashion as a way to relax and escape established violence. California, the birthplace of American Surfing, also produced much of the technology experimentations used in the nuclear space race. [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] designers in Pasadena were designing nuclear arms for day jobs, and were surfing at night. The modern surfboard design itself originates from the military industrial complex's product development, where the Manhattan Project's [[Hugh Bradner]] also designed the modern neoprene [[wetsuit]] (Inside the Curl).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130803-surfing-surprising-history-hawaiian-culture-extreme-sports/|title=Inside the Curl: Surfing's Surprising History|date=2013-08-04|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref>\n\nCalifornian engineers for the Cold War were also surfing and equally engineering that fashion. Just as the [[Bikini Atoll|Bikini]]'s name comes from a nuclear test site, Surf fashion in this era consistently references the Cold War context. Surfing became an attractive fashion identity in this era because it perpetuates adolescence, and the pursuit of pleasure in times of anxiety and paranoia. In a teenage driven culture, which aimed to ignore establishment conflicts, surfers mused [[Hawaiian culture|Hawaii]] and its associated [[tiki culture]] as a place of escape with tropical paradises as the antithesis to modern society. This sustained Hawaiian flora and fauna patterns' in fashion its attraction. The Sixties Surfer was not the first to escape violence or revolutionize the pursuit of happiness through Polynesian fascination.

It was a decade that broke many fashion traditions, mirroring social movements during the time. Around the middle of the decade, fashions arising from small pockets of young people in a few urban centres received large amounts of media publicity, and began to heavily influence both the ''[[haute couture]]'' of elite designers and the mass-market manufacturers.

In addition to tailored skirts, women wore [[stiletto heel]] shoes and suits with short boxy jackets, and oversized buttons. Simple, geometric dresses, known as shifts, were also in style. For evening wear, full-skirted evening gowns were worn; these often had a low [[d\u00e9colletage]] and close-fitting waists. For casual wear, [[Capri pants|capri trousers]] were the fashion for women and girls.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n====Bikini====\n[[File:Beach Party Annette Funicello Frankie Avalon Mid-1960s.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Publicity photo of [[Frankie Avalon]] and [[Annette Funicello]] for [[Beach party film|Beach Party]] films (c. 1960s).

The breakthrough came in 1963, after rather large versions featured in the surprise hit teen film ''[[Beach Party]]'', which launched the [[Beach party film]] genre.\n\n====The rise of trousers for women====\n[[File:Go-go boots by Andre Courreges, 1965.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[go-go boot]]s designed by [[Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges|Andre Courrege]] in 1965.]]\nThe 1960s were an age of fashion innovation for women.

Traditionally, trousers had been viewed by western society as masculine, but by the early 1960s, it had become acceptable for women to wear them everyday. These included [[Levi Strauss]] jeans, which had previously been considered blue collar wear, and \"stretch\" [[drainpipe jeans]] with [[elastane]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20181221000740/https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/FD77/production/_93778846_2131980480_a774c5e5f1_o.jpg 1962 Sears catalog]</ref> Women's trousers came in a variety of styles: narrow, wide, below the knee, above the ankle, and eventually mid thigh. Mid-thigh cut trousers, also known as shorts, evolved around 1969.

It was heavily influenced by the [[Space Race]] of the [[Cold War]], in addition to popular [[science fiction]] [[paperback]]s, films and television series such as ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Dan Dare]]'', or ''[[Lost In Space]]''.

Synthetic material was also popular with space age fashion designers. After the Second World War, fabrics like nylon, corfam, orlon, terylene, lurex and spandex were promoted as cheap, easy to dry, and wrinkle-free. The synthetic fabrics of the 1960s allowed space age fashion designers to design garments with bold shapes and a plastic texture.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Sixties fashion: From less is more to youthquake.|last=Walford|first=Johnathan|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2013|isbn=9780500516935|location=London|pages=110}}</ref> Non-cloth material, such as [[polyester]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], became popular in clothing and accessories as well. For daytime outerwear, short plastic raincoats, colourful [[swing coats]] and dyed fake-furs were popular for young women. In 1966, the [[Nehru jacket]] arrived on the fashion scene, and was worn by both sexes. Suits were very diverse in color but were, for the first time ever, fitted and very slim. Waistlines for women were left unmarked and hemlines were getting shorter and shorter.\n\n[[File:Brigitte Bardot.jpg|thumb|left|French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] wearing a transparent top and a [[feather boa]], 1968]]\nFootwear for women included low-heeled sandals and kitten-heeled pumps, as well as the trendy white [[go-go boots]]. Shoes, boots, and handbags were often made of [[patent leather]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Beatles wore elastic-sided boots similar to [[Winkle-pickers]] with pointed toes and [[Heel (shoe)#Male wear|Cuban heel]]s. These were known as \"Beatle boots\" and were widely copied by young men in Britain.\n\nThe French designer [[Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges]] was particularly influential in the development of space age fashion. The \"space look\" he introduced in the spring of 1964 included trouser suits, goggles, box-shaped dresses with high skirts, and go-go boots.

The miniskirt changed fashion forever.\n\nThe definition of a miniskirt is a skirt with a hemline that is generally between 6 and 7 inches above the knees. Early references to the miniskirt from the Wyoming newspaper ''The Billings Gazette'', described the miniskirt as a controversial item that was produced in Mexico City.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} During the 1950s, the miniskirt began appearing in [[science fiction film]]s like [[Flight to Mars (film)|''Flight to Mars'']] and ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''<ref>Parks, C. (2015, March 23). ''The Miniskirt: An Evolution From The '60s To Now''. Retrieved October 30, 2016, from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/23/mini-skirt-evolution_n_6894040.html</ref>\n\n[[Mary Quant]] and [[Andre Courreges]] both contributed to the invention of the miniskirt during the 1960s. [[Mary Quant]], A British designer, was one of the pioneers of the miniskirt during 1960. She named the skirt after her favorite car, the Mini Cooper. Quant introduced her design in the mid-60s at her London boutique, Bazaar. She has said: \" We wanted to increase the availability of fun for everyone. We felt that expensive things were almost immoral and the New Look was totally irrelevant to us.\" Miniskirts became popular in London and Paris and the term \"Chelsea Look\" was coined.<ref>Paula Reed. (2012). In ''Fifty Fashion Looks that Changed the 1960s'' (pp. 30\u201331). England: Alison Starling.</ref>\n\n[[Andre Courreges]] was a French fashion designer who also began experimenting with hemlines in the early 1960s. He started to show space-age dresses that hit above the knee in late 1964. His designs were more structured and sophisticated than Quant's design.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This made the miniskirt more acceptable to the French public. His clothes represented a couture version of the \"[[Youthquake (movement)|Youthquake]]\" street style and heralded the arrival of the \"moon girl\" look.<ref>Koda, H. (2010). ''100 Dresses: The Costume Institute'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art. S.l.: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\nAs teen culture became stronger, the term \"[[Youthquake (movement)|Youthquake]]\" came to mean the power of young people. This was unprecedented before the 1960s. Before [[World War II]], teenagers dressed and acted like their parents. Many settled down and began raising families when they were young, normally right after high school. They were often expected to work and assist their families financially. Therefore, youth culture begins to develop only after World War II, when the advancement of many technologies and stricter child labor laws became mainstream. Teenagers during this period had more time to enjoy their youth, and the freedom to create their own culture separate from their parents. Teens soon began establishing their own identities and communities, with their own views and ideas, breaking away from the traditions of their parents.<ref>Blackman, C. (2012). ''100 Years of Fashion''. London: Laurence King Pub.</ref> The fabulous \"little girl\" look was introduced to USA\u2014styling with Bobbie Brooks, bows, patterned knee socks and mini skirts. The miniskirt and the \"little girl\" look that accompanied it reflect a revolutionary shift in the way people dress. Instead of younger generations dressing like adults, they became inspired by childlike dress.<ref>Nectara, J (2012, July 13). \"The Miniskirt \u2013 A Short History.\" Retrieved October 30, 2016, from http://www.fashionavecpassion.com/the-miniskirt-a-short-history/</ref>\n\n[[Second-wave feminism]] made the miniskirt popular. Women had entered the professional workforce in larger numbers during World War II and many women soon found they craved a career and life outside the home.<ref>Bourne, L.

Flared trousers and bell bottoms appeared in 1964 as an alternative to [[capri pants]], and led the way to the hippie period introduced in the 1960s. Bell bottoms were usually worn with chiffon blouses, polo-necked ribbed sweaters or tops that bared the midriff. These were made in a variety of materials including heavy denims, silks, and even elasticated fabrics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tarrant|first=Naomi|title=The Development of Costume|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=88}}</ref> Variations of [[polyester]] were worn along with acrylics.<ref name=\"retrowow2\" /> A popular look for females was the suede mini-skirt worn with a French polo-neck top, square-toed boots, and [[Newsboy cap]] or [[beret]]. This style was also popular in the early 2000s.\n\nWomen were inspired by the top models of the day which included [[Twiggy]], [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Colleen Corby]], [[Penelope Tree]], and [[Veruschka]]. Velvet mini dresses with lace-collars and matching cuffs, wide tent dresses and [[culottes]] pushed aside the geometric shift. False eyelashes were in vogue, as was pale lipstick.  Hemlines kept rising, and by 1968 they had reached well above mid-thigh. These were known as \"micro-minis\". This was when the \"angel dress\" first made its appearance on the fashion scene. A micro-mini dress with a flared skirt and long, wide trumpet sleeves, it was usually worn with patterned tights, and was often made of crocheted lace, velvet, chiffon or sometimes cotton with a [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] print. The cowled-neck \"monk dress\" was another religion-inspired alternative; the cowl could be pulled up to be worn over the head. For evening wear, skimpy chiffon baby-doll dresses with spaghetti-straps were popular, as well as the \"cocktail dress\", which was a close-fitting sheath, usually covered in lace with matching long sleeves.<ref>Contini, p. 317</ref> [[Feather boa]]s were occasionally worn. Famous celebrities associated with marketing the miniskirt included: [[Twiggy]]; model [[Jean Shrimpton]], who attended an event in the Melbourne Cup Carnival in Australia wearing a miniskirt in 1965; [[Goldie Hawn]], who appeared on ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'' with her mini skirt in 1967;  and [[Jackie Kennedy]], who wore a short white pleated Valentino dress when she married Aristotle Onassis in 1968.\n\n====The Single Girl====\n[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] was a model who reflected the ideal of the single girl.]]\nWriter, [[Helen Gurley Brown]], wrote [[Sex and the Single Girl]] in 1962. This book acted as a guide for women of any marital status to take control of their own lives financially as well as emotionally.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex and the Single Girl|last=Brown|first=Helen Gurley|publisher=Bernard Geis Associates|year=1962|isbn=9781569802526|location=|pages=}}</ref> This book was revolutionary since it encouraged sex before marriage; something that was historically looked down upon.

The Single Girl represented 'movement'. She was young, single, active, and economically self-sufficient. To represent this new Single Girl feminine ideal, many 1960s photographers photographed models outside\u2014often having them walk or run in fashion shoots. Models in the 1960s also promoted sports wear, which reflected the modern fascination with speed and the quickening pace of the 1960s urban life. Although the Single Girl was economically, socially and emotionally self-sufficient, the ideal body form was difficult for many to achieve. Therefore, women were constrained by diet restrictions that seemed to contradict the image of the empowered 1960s Single Girl.<ref name=\"Radner 2001 183\u2013197\">{{cite book|last=Radner|first=Hilary|title=Body Dressing|year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=1859734448|pages=183\u2013197|editor=Joanne Entwistle and Elizabeth B.

The Working Girl motif represented another shift for the modern, fashionable woman. Unlike earlier periods, characterized by formal evening gowns and the European look, the 1960s Working Girl popularized day wear and \"working clothing\". New ready to wear lines replaced individualized formal couture fashion. The Working Girl created an image of a new, independent woman who has control over her body.<ref name=\"Radner 2001 183\u2013197\" />\n\nThere was a new emphasis on [[ready-to-wear]] and personal style.

She emerged in the mid-sixties, and her defining characteristic is the iconic miniskirt. \"Dolly Girls\" also sported long hair, slightly teased, of course, and childish-looking clothing. Clothes were worn tight fitting, sometimes even purchased from a children's section. Dresses were often embellished with lace, ribbons, and other frills; the look was topped off with light colored tights. Crocheted clothing also took off within this specific style.<ref>Bond, David (1981). ''The Guinness Guide to 20th Century Fashion.''

Hosiery manufacturers of the time like Mary Quant (who founded Pamela Mann Legwear) combined the \"Flower Power\" style of dress and the [[Pop Art]] school of design to create fashion tights that would appeal to a female audience that enjoyed [[psychedelia]].<ref>\n[http://www.uktights.com/article/13/hosiery-trends-over-the-decades Hosiery Trends Over The Decades]</ref>\nPonchos, moccasins, love beads, peace signs, medallion necklaces, chain belts, polka dot-printed fabrics, and long, puffed \"bubble\" sleeves were popular fashions in the late 1960s. Both men and women wore frayed bell-bottomed jeans, tie-dyed shirts, work shirts, Jesus sandals, and headbands. Women would often go barefoot and some went braless. The idea of multiculturalism also became very popular; a lot of style inspiration was drawn from traditional clothing in Nepal, India, Bali, Morocco and African countries. Because inspiration was being drawn from all over the world, there was increasing separation of style; clothing pieces often had similar elements and created similar silhouettes, but there was no real \"uniform\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Miles|first=Barry|title=Hippie|year=2004|publisher=Sterling|isbn=1402714424}}</ref>\n\nFringed buck-skin vests, flowing caftans, the \"lounging\" or \"hostess\" pajamas were also popular. \"Hostess\" pajamas consisted of a tunic top over floor-length culottes, usually made of polyester or chiffon. Long maxi coats, often belted and lined in sheepskin, appeared at the close of the decade. [[Animal prints]] were popular for women in the autumn and winter of 1969.

[[Pendleton jacket]]s were common due to their cheapness, warmth and durability. Design wise the surf jacket suited popularly with nonchalance, warmth for coastal Californian climate, and utility pockets for surf wax and VW car keys, two surf essentials (Pendleton Woolen Mills).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.heddels.com/2016/09/pendleton-woolen-mills-an-unlikely-surf-icon/|title=Pendleton Woolen Mills - An Unlikely Surf Icon|date=2016-09-12|work=Heddels|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Pendleton Surf Jacket expanded upon Fifties pop cultural fashions, however new in its relaxed, intangibly cool vibe.

The Pendleton ''[[Tartan|plaid]]'', originally worn by [[Lumberjack|logger]]s, hunters and fishermen, was a common item of [[casual wear]] for American men of all classes before the [[British invasion]]. For the youth of the 60s, however, the plaid Pendleton signified [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and tribal seamen style translated from Welsh folklore, rebellious Scots [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]], and rugged American frontiersmen (Bowe).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gearpatrol.com/2014/10/02/history-flannel/|title=The History of Flannel - Gear Patrol|date=2014-10-02|work=Gear Patrol|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Sixties invented the Californian Cool style, by relaxing style to escape [[Cold War]] meltdowns with [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] fascinations, bridging the macho 1950s teen towards 1960s Hippie style. The Cold War's tense political context conceived Surf Fashion as a way to relax and escape established violence. California, the birthplace of American Surfing, also produced much of the technology experimentations used in the nuclear space race. [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] designers in Pasadena were designing nuclear arms for day jobs, and were surfing at night. The modern surfboard design itself originates from the military industrial complex's product development, where the Manhattan Project's [[Hugh Bradner]] also designed the modern neoprene [[wetsuit]] (Inside the Curl).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130803-surfing-surprising-history-hawaiian-culture-extreme-sports/|title=Inside the Curl: Surfing's Surprising History|date=2013-08-04|access-date=2018-04-15}}</ref>\n\nCalifornian engineers for the Cold War were also surfing and equally engineering that fashion. Just as the [[Bikini Atoll|Bikini]]'s name comes from a nuclear test site, Surf fashion in this era consistently references the Cold War context. Surfing became an attractive fashion identity in this era because it perpetuates adolescence, and the pursuit of pleasure in times of anxiety and paranoia. In a teenage driven culture, which aimed to ignore establishment conflicts, surfers mused [[Hawaiian culture|Hawaii]] and its associated [[tiki culture]] as a place of escape with tropical paradises as the antithesis to modern society. This sustained Hawaiian flora and fauna patterns' in fashion its attraction. The Sixties Surfer was not the first to escape violence or revolutionize the pursuit of happiness through Polynesian fascination.

In the UK, it was the new fashion for mod women to cut their hair short and close to their heads.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pendergast|first=Tom and Sarah|title=Fashion, Costume and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=MI, USA|isbn=0-7876-5422-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/fashioncostumecu0000pend/page/935 935]|url=https://archive.org/details/fashioncostumecu0000pend/page/935}}</ref> Meanwhile, hippie girls favored long, straight natural hair, kept in place with a [[bandana]].\n\n===Men's hairstyles===\n[[File:Brian_Jones_1967.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brian Jones]] of the [[Rolling Stones]] with typical [[mod haircut]], 1967]]\nFor professional men born before 1940, the side parted [[short back and sides]] was the norm in the UK, Europe and America from the early 60s until the end of the decade. Black men usually buzzed their hair short or wore styles like the [[conk]], artificially straightened with chemicals. Blue collar white men, especially former military personnel, often wore [[buzzcut]]s and [[flattop|flat tops]] during the summer. During the early to mid 60s, rebellious [[Irish-American]], [[Italian-American]] and [[Hispanic]] teens influenced by the [[greaser subculture]] often wore [[ducktail]]s, [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]]s and [[quiffs]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nDue to the influence of [[mod subculture|mod]] bands like [[the Beatles]] or the [[Rolling Stones]], [[mop-top]] hairstyles were most popular for white and [[Hispanic]] men during the mid 60s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The [[mod haircut]] began as a short version around 1963 through 1964, developed into a longer style worn during 1965\u201366, and eventually evolved into an unkempt hippie version worn during the 1967\u201369 period and into the early 1970s. Facial hair, evolving in its extremity from simply having longer sideburns, to [[mustache]]s and goatees, to full-grown beards became popular with young men from 1966 onwards.\n\nHead coverings changed dramatically towards the end of the decade as men's hats went out of style, replaced by the [[bandanna]], [[digger hat]], [[Stetson]], or [[Bob Dylan cap]] if anything at all.  As men let their hair grow long,  the [[Afro]] became the hairstyle of choice for [[African American]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This afro was not just a fashion statement but also an emblem of racial pride. They started to believe that by allowing their hair to grow in its nature state without chemical treatments, they would be accepting their racial identities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pendergast|first=Tom and Sarah|title=Fashion, Costume and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=MI, USA|isbn=0-7876-5422-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fashioncostumecu0000pend/page/937 937\u2013938]|url=https://archive.org/details/fashioncostumecu0000pend/page/937}}</ref>\n\n==Image gallery==\nA selection of images representing the fashion trends of the 1960s:{{Clear}}<gallery>\nFile:Mrs. Kennedy in the Diplomatic Reception Room.jpg|First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] wearing a red wool dress with matching jacket.

He sings \"[[Jingle Bells]]\".\n\nThe second holiday-themed doll was released in February 2011 in time for [[Valentine's Day]]. This doll is red with a pink shirt featuring red hearts. Its ears are unique in that they are also shaped like hearts, breaking away from the bear, dog, elephant and rabbit ears used up until now. This doll sings \"[[Let Me Call You Sweetheart]]\" in her alto voice.\n\nIn March 2011, the third holiday-themed doll was released for [[Easter]]. This Sing-a-ma-jig is a white Easter rabbit with more detailed bunny ears. It sings \"[[Peter Cottontail (song)|Here Comes Peter Cottontail]]\", and rather than saying \"Goodbye\" or \"See you later\", signs off by saying, \"Happy Easter!\"  His shirt is covered in a colorful Easter Egg pattern. He has a baritone vocal range.\n\nA [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] themed doll was released in time for the holiday in 2011, was Red, White, and Blue, and sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". Instead of \"Hello!\" or \"How do you do?\", he signs on by saying \"Happy Independence Day!\" He has a tenor vocal range.\n\nFour [[Halloween]] themed dolls were released in October 2011. These Sing-a-ma-jigs included a pumpkin, a ghost, a skeleton, and a witch. All of them sing Trick or Treat and the ghost, skeleton and witch were [[Target Corporation|Target]] exclusives, whereas the pumpkin was not exclusive. For the way they sign off, the pumpkin and ghost sign off by saying \"Happy Halloween!\", the skeleton says \"Scare You Later' and the Witch says \"See You Later\". Also, for the way they sign on, the pumpkin and ghost say \"Trick or Treat\" and the skeleton and witch say \"Happy Halloween\" in their tenor, bass and soprano voices.\n\nIn November 2011, two new Christmas themed Sing-a-ma-jigs were released. They included a snowman and a reindeer. The snowman sings [[Jingle Bells]] and the reindeer sings \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" in their alto voices.\n\n===Special Edition===\nThere are two Birthday Sing-a-ma-jigs: the pink \"Birthday Soprano\" and the blue \"Birthday Tenor\". Each sings \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" in different pitches in addition to chattering and harmonizing with other Sing-a-ma-jig characters, and rather than saying \"Goodbye\" or \"See you later\", The birthday tenor signs off by saying, \"Can I have cake too?\" and the birthday soprano signs off by saying, \"Bye Bye, Birthday!\".\n\nThere are also [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Disney [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] Sing-a-ma-jigs. Mickey and Minnie each sing a favorite Disney tune. Mickey sings the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Theme Song and Minnie sings Hot Dog.\n\n=== The Hits! ===\nThere are 3 Sing-a-ma-jigs of a series part called \"The Hits!\".

Each \"squeeze\" causes the Sing-a-ma-jig to open its mouth to emit noise. The doll's mouth contains a set of plastic [[teeth]] that click together when closing. A Sing-a-ma-jig's noises include songs, \"jibber-jabber\" made up of vowel sounds, different notes on the [[octave scale]], a greeting, and a goodbye. They each sing a different public-domain [[song]] unique to their model. The voice that each one has is unique to its model as well.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2035319_2034286_2034245,00.html | title=The Top 10 Everything of 2010 - Sing-a-ma-jigs | work=TIME | date=December 9, 2010 | accessdate=2011-01-06 | author=Townsend, Allie}}</ref>\n\nSing-a-ma-jigs were popularized by [[John Green (author)|John Green]] in his video \"Making Adorable Music\" which was uploaded to [[YouTube]] on October 22, 2010.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upHNBY3Kiq4|title=Making Adorable Music|publisher=YouTube|work=VlogBrothers|date=October 22, 2010|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Basic===\nAs of late 2019, there are 22 \"basic\" Sing-a-ma-jig models: Italicised colors are the ones that have the \"Voice Wiggle Effect\", although the Aqua and Rose ones were later released as standard versions without that effect.

He sings \"[[Jingle Bells]]\".\n\nThe second holiday-themed doll was released in February 2011 in time for [[Valentine's Day]]. This doll is red with a pink shirt featuring red hearts. Its ears are unique in that they are also shaped like hearts, breaking away from the bear, dog, elephant and rabbit ears used up until now. This doll sings \"[[Let Me Call You Sweetheart]]\" in her alto voice.\n\nIn March 2011, the third holiday-themed doll was released for [[Easter]]. This Sing-a-ma-jig is a white Easter rabbit with more detailed bunny ears. It sings \"[[Peter Cottontail (song)|Here Comes Peter Cottontail]]\", and rather than saying \"Goodbye\" or \"See you later\", signs off by saying, \"Happy Easter!\"  His shirt is covered in a colorful Easter Egg pattern. He has a baritone vocal range.\n\nA [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] themed doll was released in time for the holiday in 2011, was Red, White, and Blue, and sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". Instead of \"Hello!\" or \"How do you do?\", he signs on by saying \"Happy Independence Day!\" He has a tenor vocal range.\n\nFour [[Halloween]] themed dolls were released in October 2011. These Sing-a-ma-jigs included a pumpkin, a ghost, a skeleton, and a witch. All of them sing Trick or Treat and the ghost, skeleton and witch were [[Target Corporation|Target]] exclusives, whereas the pumpkin was not exclusive. For the way they sign off, the pumpkin and ghost sign off by saying \"Happy Halloween!\", the skeleton says \"Scare You Later' and the Witch says \"See You Later\". Also, for the way they sign on, the pumpkin and ghost say \"Trick or Treat\" and the skeleton and witch say \"Happy Halloween\" in their tenor, bass and soprano voices.\n\nIn November 2011, two new Christmas themed Sing-a-ma-jigs were released. They included a snowman and a reindeer. The snowman sings [[Jingle Bells]] and the reindeer sings \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" in their alto voices.\n\n===Special Edition===\nThere are two Birthday Sing-a-ma-jigs: the pink \"Birthday Soprano\" and the blue \"Birthday Tenor\". Each sings \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" in different pitches in addition to chattering and harmonizing with other Sing-a-ma-jig characters, and rather than saying \"Goodbye\" or \"See you later\", The birthday tenor signs off by saying, \"Can I have cake too?\" and the birthday soprano signs off by saying, \"Bye Bye, Birthday!\".\n\nThere are also [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Disney [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] Sing-a-ma-jigs. Mickey and Minnie each sing a favorite Disney tune. Mickey sings the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Theme Song and Minnie sings Hot Dog.\n\n=== The Hits! ===\nThere are 3 Sing-a-ma-jigs of a series part called \"The Hits!\". These were only sold in the UK and Japan and Korea, and they all have the Voice Wiggle Effect. Author [[John Green (Author)|John Green]] of the [[Vlogbrothers|Vlogbrothers]] stated that he has been in a 14 month long, ongoing search for the Red Sing-a-ma-jig.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPlyf9OqsNY|title=hey now|last=Green|first=John|date=April 21, 2020|website=VlogBrothers|publisher=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
