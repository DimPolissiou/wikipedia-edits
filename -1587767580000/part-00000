The external gills will eventually be hidden by a layer of skin.|alt=|161x161px]]\nTadpoles of frogs and toads are usually globular, with a laterally compressed tail and internal gills. When first hatched, anuran tadpoles have external gills that are eventually covered by skin. Newly hatched tadpoles are also equipped with a cement gland which allows them to attach to objects.

Most tadpoles are fully [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]], though some species of amphibians have tadpoles that are [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]]. Tadpoles have some features that are may not be found in adult amphibians such as a lateral line, gills, and tails. As they undergo [[metamorphosis]], the diet of tadpoles changes and they will start to breathe air.\n\nHaving no hard parts, it might be expected that [[fossil]] tadpoles would not exist.

Most of the levels are riddled with enemies and if the player's ship is hit by an enemy or projectile, it will reflect the amount of damage taken as a result: it can lose the laser tip and the engine before the last hit that will obliterate the player's ship. In addition, there is a hidden level inside the game where the player can earn high scores by destroying the faces of the game's creators.<ref name=\"EGMgoz\">{{cite magazine|last=Kosher|first=Mike|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_11/page/n35|title=Tricks of the Trade - Secret Tricks, Codes, And Strategies - Gates of Zendocon - Secret Designers Room|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=11|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1990|page=35}}</ref><ref name=\"IGNgoz\"/>\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.jpg|thumb|right|''Gates of Zendocon'' started its development before any Atari Lynx hardware existed.]]\n''Gates of Zendocon'' was written by Peter Engelbrite when he worked at Epyx as games developer and programmer.

Programmed by ''[[Todd's Adventures in Slime World]]'' author Peter Engelbrite, ''Gates of Zendocon'' began its development prior to the existence of functional Lynx hardware.\n\n''Gates of Zendocon'' received positive reception from critics after its initial release, with praise towards the presentation, originality and gameplay but the sound department received criticism.

Most of the levels are riddled with enemies and if the player's ship is hit by an enemy or projectile, it will reflect the amount of damage taken as a result: it can lose the laser tip and the engine before the last hit that will obliterate the player's ship. In addition, there is a hidden level inside the game where the player can earn high scores by destroying the faces of the game's creators.<ref name=\"EGMgoz\">{{cite magazine|last=Kosher|first=Mike|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_11/page/n35|title=Tricks of the Trade - Secret Tricks, Codes, And Strategies - Gates of Zendocon - Secret Designers Room|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=11|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1990|page=35}}</ref><ref name=\"IGNgoz\"/>\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.jpg|thumb|right|''Gates of Zendocon'' started its development before any Atari Lynx hardware existed.]]\n''Gates of Zendocon'' was written by Peter Engelbrite when he worked at Epyx as games developer and programmer.

At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Harry divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. The marriage may well have saved her career, as several of her tenants had sued her the year before for forcing them to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year [[lease]]s. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Harry's growing hotel empire.\n\n[[File:GreenwichCTGreenwichHospitalEntrance09212007.JPG|thumb|Leona and Harry B.

He later concentrated on the hotel industry, building the [[Lotte New York Palace Hotel|Helmsley Palace Hotel]] on [[Madison Avenue]]. Together, the Helmsleys built a New York real estate empire that included [[Helmsley Building|230 Park Avenue]], the [[Empire State Building]], and the [[Tudor City]] apartment complex on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]], as well as Helmsley-Spear Inc., their management and leasing business. The couple also developed properties that included the Helmsley Palace Hotel, the New York Helmsley Hotel, the [[Park Lane Hotel (New York)|Park Lane Hotel]], and hotels in Florida and other states. By the beginning of 1989, twenty-three hotels in the chain were directly controlled by Leona Helmsley.\n\nHelmsley was featured in an advertising campaign portraying her as a demanding \"queen\" who wanted nothing but the best for her guests. The slightest mistake was usually grounds for firing, and Helmsley was known to shout insults and obscenities at targeted employees just before they were fired.\n\nOn March 31, 1982, Helmsley's only child, Jay Panzirer, died of a [[heart attack]] resulting from [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].<ref>{{cite book|title= The Helmsleys: The Rise and Fall of Harry & Leona|last= Hammer|first= Richard|year= 1990|publisher= NAL Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-453-00682-5|page= [https://archive.org/details/helmsleysrisefal00hamm/page/208 208]|url= https://archive.org/details/helmsleysrisefal00hamm/page/208}}</ref> Her son's widow, who lived in a property that Helmsley owned, received an [[eviction]] notice shortly after his funeral. Helmsley successfully sued her son's estate for money and property that she claimed he had borrowed, and she was ultimately awarded $146,092.\n\n==Tax-evasion conviction==\nDespite the Helmsleys' [[net worth]] totalling over $1&nbsp;billion, they were known for disputing payments to contractors and vendors. In 1983, the Helmsleys bought [[Dunnellen Hall]], a 21-room mansion in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], to use as a weekend retreat. The property cost $11&nbsp;million, but the Helmsleys wanted to make it even more luxurious. The work included a $1&nbsp;million [[Sprung floor|dance floor]], a silver clock and a mahogany card table.<ref name=\"Toobin\">{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-36029445_ITM|title=Rich Bitch|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|date=September 29, 2008|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}</ref> The remodeling bills came to $8&nbsp;million, which the Helmsleys were loath to pay. A group of contractors sued the Helmsleys for non-payment; the Helmsleys eventually paid off most of the debt owed to the contractors.\n\nIn 1985, during court proceedings in relation to the lawsuit, the contractors revealed that most of their work was being illegally billed to the Helmsleys' hotels as business expenses. The contractors sent a stack of the falsified invoices to the ''[[New York Post]]'' to prove that the Helmsleys were trying to avoid tax liabilities. The resulting ''Post'' story led to a federal criminal investigation. Jeremiah McCarthy, the Helmsleys' executive engineer, also alleged that Leona repeatedly demanded that he sign invoices to bill personal expenses to the Helmsley-Spear and, when McCarthy declined to do so, exploded with tyrannical outbursts, shouting, \"You're not my fucking partner! You'll sign what I tell you to sign.\"<ref>''New York Times'', August 1989.</ref> In 1988, then-[[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] indicted the Helmsleys and two of their associates on several tax-related charges, as well as [[extortion]].<ref name=\"Queen\" />\n\nThe trial was delayed until the summer of 1989 due to numerous motions by the Helmsleys' attorneys, most of them related to Harry's health. He had begun to appear enfeebled shortly after the beginning of his relationship with Leona years before, and had recently suffered a [[stroke]] on top of a pre-existing heart condition. Ultimately, he was ruled mentally and physically unfit to stand trial, and Leona would face the charges alone.<ref name=\"Queen\" />\n\nAt trial, a former Helmsley-Spear executive, Paul Ruffino, said that he refused to sign phony invoices billing the company for work done on the Connecticut mansion. Ruffino, originally engaged to assist Harry through the Hospitality Management Services arm, said that Leona fired him on several different occasions for refusing to sign the bills, only for Harry to usually tell him to ignore her and come back to work. Another one of the key witnesses was a former housekeeper at the Helmsley home, Elizabeth Baum, who recounted Leona telling her, \"We don't pay taxes.

At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Harry divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. The marriage may well have saved her career, as several of her tenants had sued her the year before for forcing them to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year [[lease]]s. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Harry's growing hotel empire.\n\n[[File:GreenwichCTGreenwichHospitalEntrance09212007.JPG|thumb|Leona and Harry B. Helmsley Medical Building, the main building of [[Greenwich Hospital (Connecticut)|Greenwich Hospital]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]]]\n\nSupposedly under her influence, Harry began a program of conversion of apartment buildings [[Condominium conversion|into condos]]. He later concentrated on the hotel industry, building the [[Lotte New York Palace Hotel|Helmsley Palace Hotel]] on [[Madison Avenue]]. Together, the Helmsleys built a New York real estate empire that included [[Helmsley Building|230 Park Avenue]], the [[Empire State Building]], and the [[Tudor City]] apartment complex on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]], as well as Helmsley-Spear Inc., their management and leasing business. The couple also developed properties that included the Helmsley Palace Hotel, the New York Helmsley Hotel, the [[Park Lane Hotel (New York)|Park Lane Hotel]], and hotels in Florida and other states. By the beginning of 1989, twenty-three hotels in the chain were directly controlled by Leona Helmsley.\n\nHelmsley was featured in an advertising campaign portraying her as a demanding \"queen\" who wanted nothing but the best for her guests. The slightest mistake was usually grounds for firing, and Helmsley was known to shout insults and obscenities at targeted employees just before they were fired.\n\nOn March 31, 1982, Helmsley's only child, Jay Panzirer, died of a [[heart attack]] resulting from [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].<ref>{{cite book|title= The Helmsleys: The Rise and Fall of Harry & Leona|last= Hammer|first= Richard|year= 1990|publisher= NAL Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-453-00682-5|page= [https://archive.org/details/helmsleysrisefal00hamm/page/208 208]|url= https://archive.org/details/helmsleysrisefal00hamm/page/208}}</ref> Her son's widow, who lived in a property that Helmsley owned, received an [[eviction]] notice shortly after his funeral. Helmsley successfully sued her son's estate for money and property that she claimed he had borrowed, and she was ultimately awarded $146,092.\n\n==Tax-evasion conviction==\nDespite the Helmsleys' [[net worth]] totalling over $1&nbsp;billion, they were known for disputing payments to contractors and vendors. In 1983, the Helmsleys bought [[Dunnellen Hall]], a 21-room mansion in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], to use as a weekend retreat. The property cost $11&nbsp;million, but the Helmsleys wanted to make it even more luxurious. The work included a $1&nbsp;million [[Sprung floor|dance floor]], a silver clock and a mahogany card table.<ref name=\"Toobin\">{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-36029445_ITM|title=Rich Bitch|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|date=September 29, 2008|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}</ref> The remodeling bills came to $8&nbsp;million, which the Helmsleys were loath to pay. A group of contractors sued the Helmsleys for non-payment; the Helmsleys eventually paid off most of the debt owed to the contractors.\n\nIn 1985, during court proceedings in relation to the lawsuit, the contractors revealed that most of their work was being illegally billed to the Helmsleys' hotels as business expenses. The contractors sent a stack of the falsified invoices to the ''[[New York Post]]'' to prove that the Helmsleys were trying to avoid tax liabilities. The resulting ''Post'' story led to a federal criminal investigation. Jeremiah McCarthy, the Helmsleys' executive engineer, also alleged that Leona repeatedly demanded that he sign invoices to bill personal expenses to the Helmsley-Spear and, when McCarthy declined to do so, exploded with tyrannical outbursts, shouting, \"You're not my fucking partner! You'll sign what I tell you to sign.\"<ref>''New York Times'', August 1989.</ref> In 1988, then-[[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] indicted the Helmsleys and two of their associates on several tax-related charges, as well as [[extortion]].<ref name=\"Queen\" />\n\nThe trial was delayed until the summer of 1989 due to numerous motions by the Helmsleys' attorneys, most of them related to Harry's health. He had begun to appear enfeebled shortly after the beginning of his relationship with Leona years before, and had recently suffered a [[stroke]] on top of a pre-existing heart condition. Ultimately, he was ruled mentally and physically unfit to stand trial, and Leona would face the charges alone.<ref name=\"Queen\" />\n\nAt trial, a former Helmsley-Spear executive, Paul Ruffino, said that he refused to sign phony invoices billing the company for work done on the Connecticut mansion. Ruffino, originally engaged to assist Harry through the Hospitality Management Services arm, said that Leona fired him on several different occasions for refusing to sign the bills, only for Harry to usually tell him to ignore her and come back to work. Another one of the key witnesses was a former housekeeper at the Helmsley home, Elizabeth Baum, who recounted Leona telling her, \"We don't pay taxes.

Created and produced by John T. Binkley, the series was [[Nickelodeon]]'s only teenage [[soap opera]]. The show was shot on videotape, similar to most [[daytime drama]]s.\n\nThe series was first conceived as ''Fifteen'' in hamzas futo form for [[The Disney Channel]], where a 13-episode pilot series was produced and tested in the U.S. After Disney decided not to proceed with the project, Nickelodeon and Canadian partners joined Binkley in producing the series which was known in its first and second seasons as ''Hillside'' in Canada, and throughout the 65-episode run as ''Fifteen'' in the U.S.  The show was subsequently syndicated around the world, with runs in Germany and Israel, among others. Rerun rights are held by the [[Peter Rodgers Organization]], which has made the first season available for free on [[YouTube]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6UfctxfSOoFYSRqN6NaWijRgGwW3eELI</ref>\n\nThe series features a large [[ensemble cast]] which underwent several changes over the show's four-season run. Notable cast members include [[Laura Harris]], [[Enuka Okuma]], and [[Ryan Reynolds]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Fifteen'' followed the students of fictional Hillside School and dealt with a variety of issues including [[dating]], [[divorce]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[infidelity]] and friendship. The show played heavily into [[stereotype]]s, including two characters named Dylan and Chris, who wore leather jackets to show off their toughness, but which could not completely disguise their inner selves. At one point, they play a gig with their band\n''Teenagers In Love'' at local eatery and hangout spot The Avalon.<ref>http://www.fakebands.com/wiki/index.php?title=Teenagers_in_Love</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Laura Harris]] as '''Ashley Frasier''' (Seasons 1-4) \u2013 Ashley is a soft-spoken honor student who struggles to balance academic expectations with personal relationships.

Created and produced by John T. Binkley, the series was [[Nickelodeon]]'s only teenage [[soap opera]]. The show was shot on videotape, similar to most [[daytime drama]]s.\n\nThe series was first conceived as ''Fifteen'' in an improvised form for [[The Disney Channel]], where a 13-episode pilot series was produced and tested in the U.S. After Disney decided not to proceed with the project, Nickelodeon and Canadian partners joined Binkley in producing the series which was known in its first and second seasons as ''Hillside'' in Canada, and throughout the 65-episode run as ''Fifteen'' in the U.S.  The show was subsequently syndicated around the world, with runs in Germany and Israel, among others. Rerun rights are held by the [[Peter Rodgers Organization]], which has made the first season available for free on [[YouTube]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6UfctxfSOoFYSRqN6NaWijRgGwW3eELI</ref>\n\nThe series features a large [[ensemble cast]] which underwent several changes over the show's four-season run. Notable cast members include [[Laura Harris]], [[Enuka Okuma]], and [[Ryan Reynolds]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Fifteen'' followed the students of fictional Hillside School and dealt with a variety of issues including [[dating]], [[divorce]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[infidelity]] and friendship. The show played heavily into [[stereotype]]s, including two characters named Dylan and Chris, who wore leather jackets to show off their toughness, but which could not completely disguise their inner selves.
