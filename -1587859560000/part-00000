{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

Later in the episode Sally is found to have hanged herself. The show's first Halfway House (a boarding house for recently released prisoners) is later named in her honour.\n* '''Frieda Joan \"Franky\" Doyle''' ([[Carol Burns]] \u2013 episode 1\u201320), an agitating [[lesbian]] [[motorcycle|bikie]] who suffers ferocious outbursts when she becomes angry. Her violent attitude stems in part from the fact that she is [[illiterate]]. She falls in love with fellow inmate Karen Travers, who does not appreciate her advances; however, the pair eventually strike up a friendship when Karen begins teaching Franky how to read. Despite her immense popularity with viewers, Franky appears in only the first 20 episodes (due to actress Carol Burns choosing to leave as the series was extended from a sixteen-part serial to an ongoing soap opera); after her brother Gary ([[Greg Stroud]]) is killed in a tractor accident, and feeling jaded by Karen after Franky takes her friendship to mean something more, Franky escapes the prison with Doreen and Lizzie. Although Lizzie is forced to turn back due to her weak heart, Franky and Doreen go on the run, even posing as nuns before Franky is shot dead by a Policeman. Despite Franky's short run on the show, the character is mentioned numerous times over the next couple of hundreds of episodes.\n* '''Karen Mary Travers''' (n\u00e9e Healy) ([[Peta Toppano|Peita Toppano]] \u2013 episode 1\u201380), a middle-class school-teacher who had stabbed her abusive, adulterous husband to death. Initially Karen offers up little defence for her actions (which had led to her being given a life sentence), only later does it emerge that, as well as the physical and mental abuse she refused to report, she had returned from having the [[abortion]] that her husband had forced her to have, only to find him in bed with another woman, which ultimately sees her sentence reduced to two years. Arriving at the prison, as well as being intimidated by the [[sexual harassment]] of Franky Doyle (whom she later manages to befriend), she is reunited with Dr. Greg Miller, who is now working as the prison doctor at Wentworth, whom she previously had a close relationship with before getting married. The pair have a close friendship within Wentworth at times, but also grow apart during the course of the 1979 season. With her sentence reduced, Karen is permitted to have day release to study at University; during this time she has a brief relationship with lawyer Steve Wilson, who defends her in court. Although given a two-year sentence, Karen is given parole from Wentworth by the end of the 1979 season. After several false starts, she is befriended by prisoner rights campaigner Angela Jeffries ([[Jeanie Drynan]]), who ultimately puts Karen in charge of the show's first Halfway House. Karen runs the house for a short time towards the end of the 1979 season, with the newly released Doreen Anderson as the first tenant, but during this time, Greg confesses his love for her and the two resume their relationship. In the 1979 season finale, Karen is shot by Pat O'Connell (see separate entry)'s son David, who believes that Greg was responsible for his mother's re-arrest and mistakenly shoots Karen instead of Greg. With Karen narrowly escaping death and badly scared, Greg makes plans for them to start afresh in Queensland; Karen is last seen in episode 80, recovering from her wounds; Greg (and, off-screen, Karen) leaving the series a few episodes later. When Greg makes a brief return appearance in episode 107, we hear that Karen is recovering well and the pair have now married. She's lastly mentioned in episode 201 by a psychiatrist who tries to jog back Bea's memory who ended up with a serious case of [[amnesia]] from a car accident from her transfer back to Wentworth after her temporal stay at Barnhurst.\n* '''Lynnette Jane \"Lynn\" Warner \u2013 \"Wonk\"''' ([[Kerry Armstrong]] \u2013 episode 1\u201344), a young, rather na\u00efve country girl who had come to the city to work as a nanny and arrived at Wentworth protesting her innocence at having kidnapped the baby in her care and buried him alive. She was brutally initiated into prison life, when Bea Smith, upon hearing about her crime, burned her hand \"accidentally\" with the press, giving rise to one of Prisoner's most iconic scenes. Lynn gains the nickname \"Wonky Warner\" (or just \"Wonk\") from some of the other women, especially Doreen, due to her being perceived as mentally unbalanced due to her supposed crimes. It is eventually discovered that the child's own mother had buried the child alive; clearing Lynn of her accused crime. However, upon her release, Lynn runs away from her parents' farm with Doug Parker, also an ex-convict, whom she marries, and reluctantly becomes involved with an armed hold-up, which leaves Doug dead and Lynn back inside (as well as losing the unborn baby she was carrying after being raped as a nanny). During her second spell in Wentworth, she became part of the new work release programme, working during the day at a local garden centre for Syd Butterfield ([[Alan Rowe (australian actor)|Alan Rowe]]), and getting close with Syd's son Geoffrey ([[David Cameron (actor)|David Cameron]]) in the process, much to the chagrin of Syd. Both Lynn's work programme and parole are jeopardised when she is caught trying to smuggle letters out of the prison, which she insists she has never seen before. It eventually emerges that they were planted by Doreen, who has developed a crush on Lynn, and is scared of her leaving her. After serving her time, Lynn is finally released again, though on her release day, is kidnapped by thugs who confused her with Monica Ferguson (who is released on the same day and who knew the whereabouts of some stolen loot). After being rescued by the Police, Lynn presumably returns to her parents' farm, and this is the last we see of the character (we hear of her sending a Christmas present to Doreen in episode 75). She is lastly mentioned in episode 203 by return prisoner Jeanette \"Mum\" Brooks (see below) who mentions Bea burning her hand on the steam press when Mum, according to her solicitor, believes she has to bring up some events about Bea during their time together in Wentworth to help explain why she was too anxious to go to the police when Bea arrived at her house with amnesia in episode 199. This was to help them in their court case as Mum intentionally wanted to help Bea get herself together before she had to be turned in, aiding a prisoner which led to her second re-arrest.\n* '''Gladys Anne \"Marilyn\" Mason''' ([[Margaret Laurence (actor)|Margaret Laurence]] \u2013 episode 1\u201316), the prison nymphomaniac, inside for soliciting and chiefly memorable for her erotic assignations with electrician Eddie Cook ([[Richard Moir]]) in the prison roof. Upon release, she moves in with Eddie, determined to get a decent job and go straight, but, hard up for money, reluctantly turns back to prostitution, leading to a bust up with Eddie and being sent to Wentworth once again. As Marilyn is released a second time, Bea eventually sets the pair straight, convincing Monica Ferguson to let them run her [[milk bar]]. We hear in episodes 42\u201344 of Monica selling the shop to Marilyn and Eddie, and they presumably happily continue running it. During a storyline in which Bea becomes attracted to prison visitor Ken Pearce ([[Tom Oliver]]) between episodes 105 and 116, there are several references to Marilyn and Eddie's romantic liaisons in the prison.\n* '''Doreen May Anderson (later Burns)''' ([[Colette Mann]] \u2013 episodes 1\u2013446), a childish and easily led, but generally well-meaning prisoner who was briefly involved in a sexual relationship with Franky Doyle. Thumb-sucking, teddy-bear-clutching Doreen was a petty criminal, in and out of juvenile institutions before ending up at Wentworth, with a particular talent for forgery. After Franky's death, she became close friends with Lizzie and Bea; their friendship was one of the driving forces behind the first 300 episodes' success. She was released twice in the series; after her first release she is arrested for stealing, and on her second, she steals Chrissie's baby from the hospital. In 1980 during the time she was out of the prison, she fell in love with Kevin Burns whom she married, but they were divorced not long after she was raped during her second stint in the prison during a work release scheme. The end of her marriage nearly caused her to commit suicide. She was the first victim of the Freak's 'black glove' treatment in 1982, just prior to her release. She made a few appearances in 1983 when, during Bea's escape, Doreen put her up in Sydney. Although the first to initially leave the series of the main three, she was also the last to be seen \u2013 when in 1984, she got herself put back in prison to try to avoid a marriage she had somehow agreed too, her return was more as comic relief and to bring back an old favourite following the departures of Lizzie and Bea.\n* '''Elizabeth Josephine \"Lizzie\" Birdsworth''' (n\u00e9e Cameron) ([[Sheila Florance]] \u2013 episodes 1\u2013418, featured in flashback in episode 420), an elderly, chain-smoking, alcoholic recidivist prisoner, who provided much of the series comic relief. At the series start, Lizzie had already served twenty years in prison. Working as a bush cook, she had in a drunken rage allegedly poisoned a group of six sheep shearers who'd had the audacity to complain about her cooking, with four of them dying. It was later learned someone else had added the fatal dose of poison to the food (she put in enough to make them sick) and Lizzie was released and awarded compensation. Unfortunately she was ill-equipped to fend for herself outside and quickly committed a series of crimes and was returned to prison. A fraud and her daughter looking for money pretended to be Lizzie's family which Paul Reid and Kevin Burns discover. We later find out Lizzie knew all along that they weren't her real family and she wanted to spend time with them. Marcia (Lizzie's fake daughter) tells Lizzie that she was her daughter's best friend at the orphanage and that Lizzie's real daughter died in a car crash. The fake family: Marcia and Josie later left to go to the United States where Josie was to undergo an operation. Lizzie was recognisable for her always present red cardigan sweater given to her early on in the show's run by the prison's governor, Erica Davidson. Lizzie suffered from several heart attacks and during her final time in hospital she was released to be with her real family: The Charlton's.\n\n* {{anchor|Bea Smith}}'''Beatrice Alice \"Bea\" Smith''' ([[Val Lehman]] \u2013 episodes 1\u2013400),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwwentworth.co.uk/bea.htm|title=Bea Smith (Val Lehman)|accessdate=5 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010130031100/http://www.wwwentworth.co.uk/bea.htm|archivedate=30 January 2001}}</ref> the first ever top dog \u2013 the name given to the uncaring and sadistic leader of the prisoner population \u2013 who rules Wentworth's H Block with an iron fist. Bea was initially imprisoned for strangling her husband's mistress and then shot dead her cheating husband upon her release. Her teenage daughter Debbie (played by Val Lehman's real-life daughter Cassandra) had died from a heroin overdose in 1977 while Bea was in prison, after Bea's husband had evicted her from his home. Because of her daughters' death, Bea was renowned for her hatred of drug pushers and her hatred of prisoners who commit crimes against children which everyone followed her hatred.  This characteristic, which is common in all prisons, was evident when Bea slammed the hot steam press on Lynn Warner's hand. Her hatred towards both drug pushers and users softens later in the series where she attempts to help a fellow inmate to beat her drug addiction. She and Chrissie Latham were enemies at first (as Chrissie was originally on Franky Doyle' side in the first riot) but later, they became allies, especially against Margo Gaffney. Bea was Joan Ferguson's first of three major enemies. Any chance of Bea's parole was foiled after shooting and killing Nola Mckenzie in a hospital bed. Bea escaped a total of 3 times throughout the series, although the second escape was unplanned. Bea's last rival for top dog was Sonia Stevens. Bea was transferred to Barnhurst, and her reign of terror at Wentworth's H Block is finally over. There are many references after Bea's transfer especially when Lizzie compares Bea's top dog qualities to Minnie Donovan's top dog qualities including the code of lagging when Minnie lagged on Sonia Stevens in a plan to soil Joan Ferguson. Bea writes a letter saying \"Vinegar Tits is worse than ever\" when Cass is transferred from Barnhurst Lizzie says \"our best mate Bea Smith was transferred\" Cass said that she heard Bea arrived. In episodes 536\u2013537 we hear there was a Barnhurst riot and there were 8 transfers Myra ask Nora Flynn if they brought Bea. Nora tells Myra that she was killed in the riot trying to stop it, but Ann tells Meg that she \"burnt\" to death. Bea's death was probably the biggest killed-off screen events of the show as many viewers assumed that there was hope that Val Lehman would return to the show though the actress claimed she refused several offers.\n* '''Jeanette Mary \"Mum\" Brooks''' ([[Mary Ward (actress)|Mary Ward]] \u2013 episode 1\u2013204), an elderly, dignified long-term inmate who worked in the prison garden, well loved and respected by both prisoners and officers. \"Mum\" had committed euthanasia on her terminally ill husband and had served fifteen years at the start of the series.  She helped with making newcomers to Wentworth get used to the prison routine. In Episode 2, she is released, but has nowhere to live, and after spending a brief spell living with her daughter, Lorraine Watkins ([[Anne Charleston]]), who cannot accept that Mum killed her father and does not like an ex-criminal being around her family, Mum shoplifts to deliberately get sent back to Wentworth. However, by Episode 16, she is again released, this time under the care of new parole officer Jean Vernon, who sets Mum up in a little flat with her pregnant granddaughter Judith-Ann ([[Kim Deacon]]) (whom Mum grew close to during her awkward stint living with her daughter), at which point Mum is written out of the series (as with Carol Burns, Mary Ward did not wish to commit to an ongoing serial). However, Mum and Judith-Ann appear again in episodes 30\u201333, when they unwittingly become involved with the escaped Bea (this storyline was conceived in part after requests from viewers to see what had happened to Mum). Mum and Judith-Anne are visited again in a storyline running from episode 61\u201367. Mum is in poor health, but overworking in order to support Judith-Anne's imminent birth. Meg (who is still visiting Mum) convinces Greg to tend to her, who in turn, convinces Karen (now released) to stay with Mum and Judith after Mum's short spell in hospital until the child is born. Mum's estranged daughter Lorraine (now played by [[Gabrielle Hartley]]) eventually re-appears on the scene, and after seeing Judith's baby, offers to make amends, and asks Judith and Mum to come back home and live with her. Mum is seen one more time later in the series for yet another storyline in episodes 199\u2013204, reappearing in episode 199 when Bea \u2013 who has lost her memory in a crash while being transported back from Barnhurst \u2013 finds her once more. After another brief stint at Wentworth for aiding Bea, we are told a couple of years later in episode 388 that she has died of a heart attack, but left $20,000 to the prisoners. In episode 539, Governor Ann Reynolds persuades new prisoner Daphne Graham to tend to Mum's old rose garden to make new again that wore out after six years.\n* '''Rosie Hudson''' ([[Anne-Maree McDonald]]) \u2013 episodes 2\u201373) (seen in recap of 74), a young prisoner who is heavily pregnant at the start of the series and gives birth during the riot of episodes 3\u20134. After giving birth, the character disappears from the series (being moved to the maternity block), but reappears in episodes 70\u201373. With her baby coming up to his first birthday (once again, not tallying with real time), she is in denial that he will be taken away from her by foster parents once he turns one. As a result, she suffers a breakdown, part of which, during a security alert, she punches the pregnant Chrissie in the stomach, endangering Chrissie's baby. Rosie is not seen again after these events, being taken into psychiatric care, this causes a lot of tension between the prisoners.\n* '''Lorna Young''' ([[Barbara Jungwirth]]) \u2013 episodes 2-692), One of the longest serving background characters: she appears regularly throughout the whole run of the series. Her first speaking contribution (and in a surprisingly posh voice too) is in 120, which is the first time the name Lorna is used for her, Later credits in 215 for an argument with Doreen over TV in the rec room 219 and 250 where her only line appears to be baaing like a sheep 253 where she criticises Bea for framing Marie Winter 293 when she contributes a present to use for the frame up on Joan. She gets the springs for the \"bomb\" to embarrass Joan.\n* '''Tina Murray''' ([[Hazel Henley]])\u2013 episodes 2-692), Prisoner in Wentworth. The actress is one of the background characters throughout the whole series from, though not always with this name. she is first called Murray in 206. She usually isn't given lines, and so is only credited for episodes 593 and 607.\n* '''Christine Angela \"Chrissie\" Latham''' ([[Amanda Muggleton]] \u2013 episodes 3-338), a lascivious prostitute who spent much of her time behind bars lamenting the fact that there were no men around. She murdered Bill Jackson, Meg's husband, with a pair of scissors during the show's first riot. She returned in episode 065 after being in Barnhurst where it is discovered she became pregnant in custody. Chrissie keeps the baby to avoid a bashing from Bea and her daughter Elizabeth (named after Lizzie Birdsworth) becomes Chrissie's main focus causing her to turn over a new leaf. Whilst trying to protect or keep Elizabeth from being put into homes, Chrissie tried many stunts including running away interstate with the baby. Upon her return to Wentworth, new officer Joan 'The Freak' Ferguson begins work. It is here where Joan is often dangling the idea of visits with her daughter that causes Chrissie to reveal Bea's plans to set up the Freak. When Joan admits to Chrissie she will stand up in court and give bad character references at a custody hearing, Chrissie lashes out. During this fight we see the full extent of what the Freak is capable of and Chrissie becomes hospitalised at the hands of the Freaks first real bashing. At first, an enemy of Bea Smith, she later on became one of Bea's allies.  She was eventually transferred to Barnhurst, as Bea herself later would be.\n* '''Helen Masters''' ([[Louise Pajo]] \u2013 episodes 8\u201310), an international businesswoman who was well known in the media due to her cosmetics enterprise remanded to Wentworth for running down and killing a child in a hit and run. She had denied all involvement and was found innocent although it was revealed that she was secretly guilty and had been driving the car when heavily intoxicated. Her haughty attitude alienates both staff and prisoners. She subsequently won over many of the prisoners, including Bea, as she demanded better conditions and promised to campaign for such when she was released. However, on a television interview after she was freed, she turned on the prisoners, saying they deserved all they got, humiliating Bea.\n* '''Monica \"Monnie\" Ferguson''' ([[Lesley Baker]] \u2013 episodes 15\u201360), a brutish, hulking inmate inside for bashing her weaselly husband Fred ([[Gary Files]]). A friend of Bea Smith (though the pair often argued) after the pair had previously been cellmates in another prison, she initially acts as a sidekick to her (at which point the character was a semi-regular), but upon Bea's escape, takes over as Top Dog herself, using very heavy-handed tactics and upsetting many of the women. After Bea's recapture, Monica attempts to remain Top Dog, leading to a brief power struggle. After one scuffle with Smith, in which Meg Jackson is injured, and with her parole coming up, Monica backs down rather than risk not getting paroled. However, with her release, she agrees to recover Joyce Martain's hidden loot from a payroll heist in return for a cut, in order to pay of husband Fred's gambling debts; but Fred has exaggerated his debts in order to get money out of her and run off with his fancy girl Denise \"Blossom\" Crabtree (see separate entry). When Monica finds out, distraught after she had done so much to make a fresh go with him, she bashes him, and is sent to Wentworth once again (and the loot is recovered soon after). During her second stint in Wentworth, Monica becomes involved in a couple of minor escapades (such as exploiting Deputy Governor Jim Fletcher's [[haemophobia]] with Bea), but for the most part tries to keep out of trouble in order to get her parole. Towards the end of her sentence, with Bea in solitary, Monica finds herself at odds with criminal mastermind Toni McNally (see separate entry), whom she refuses to bow down to, while Toni and henchman Martha suspect Monie of tipping off Vera with information about Toni's smuggling booze and drugs into the prison (although just how much Monica has told Vera, if anything, is never made overly clear). Monica's parole seems doomed when she finally flips over Martha's taunts and lashes out, until Officer Jackson speaks up for her in front of Governor Davidson, saying that she believes the incident was a setup to ruin Monica's parole. Erica decides to release Monnie, who is planning to start afresh in a new State, and it is the last time the character is seen in the series.\n* '''Barbara Davidson''' ([[Sally Cahill (Australian actress)|Sally Cahill]] \u2013 episodes 17\u201324), the niece of governor Erica Davidson. Admitted to Wentworth on drug charges, a seemingly girly, innocent persona covers the fact that she is calculating and sly. She strikes up a partnership with Vera, which includes framing Monica Ferguson for possession of drugs. She is eventually transferred to Barnhurst after Doreen's bullying pushes her to dousing her cell in petrol and threatening to set light to herself, leading Erica to realise that it is unrealistic to have a close relation in Wentworth without risk of either special treatment or bullying. She is mentioned last in episode 215.\n* '''Catherine Roberts''' ([[Margo McLennan]] \u2013 episodes 18\u201324), a middle-class housewife who runs down and kills the man who raped her teenage daughter. After she is sentenced, striking a friendship with Bea in the process, the character just disappears, and it is later revealed she has been moved to another block in Episode 28. It is assumed her husband Ken sends their daughter away to stay with her aunt, though this is never revealed one way or the other as, once Catherine's character disappears, so does the story.\n* '''Phyllis Hunt''' ([[Reylene Pearce]] \u2013 episodes 21\u2013460), background prisoner who eventually takes on a larger role around the time of Bea Smith's departure from the series, turning nasty in the process. After messing up Reb's drugs scheme at the Wentworth Fete, Reb takes revenge and horribly bashes her with a wooden statue, leading her to have permanent brain damage. her boyfriend takes revenge on Ann Reynolds.\n* '''Susan Rice''' ([[Briony Behets]] \u2013 episodes 25\u201329), an emotionally fragile woman sent to Wentworth after being caught [[shoplifting]]. As Officer Jackson becomes concerned about Susan's mental state, it becomes apparent that Susan is angry at a (fictional) pop star Jason Richards for taking her husband Fredrick away from her, destroying their marriage. It ultimately transpires that Richards is actually the [[stage name]] of Fredrick, and they are one and the same. Upon release, Susan invades a TV interview with \"Richards\", throwing acid in his face, before being taken away to a secure psychiatric unit.\n* '''Martha Eaves''' ([[Kate Jason]] \u2013 episodes 29\u201364), a dimwitted, burly prisoner ridiculed by the other women, but who often acts as hired muscle for wannabe top dogs or those needing physical back-up. She is involved in two notable storylines: the first comes in episodes 50\u201352 when, after constantly being bullied and belittled by the other woman for being stupid, she tries to befriend child murder Bella Albrecht (see separate entry), who is hated by the other women for her crime. But after Martha overhears Bella saying that she too thinks Martha is stupid, Martha attacks her in the shower blocks and drowns her. When Martha returns from solitary in episode 58, she starts working for criminal mastermind Antonia McNally, who uses Martha's muscle to take over Bea's position while Bea is in solitary. Eventually, as the other women begin to become disillusioned with McNally and start to side with Bea to go up against Vera Bennett and Jim Fletcher who are running the prison when Governor Erica Davidson takes a leave, Martha wants her and Toni to join in on the act but Toni wants no part of it due to her trial. She tells Martha that she could join them in the act if she wants to which she does. Although not written out of the series in any real manner, Martha is not seen after the conclusion of the McNally storyline in episode 64. In episode 128, Noeline Burke is scaring another woman accused of \"baby bashing\", Gail Summers, by telling her that Martha killed the previous such inmate and was sent to the loony bin as a result, which seemingly conflicts with Martha's involvement in the McNally storyline. (It might be presumed that Noeline was just trying to cause trouble).\n* '''Noeline Burke''' ([[Jude Kuring]] \u2013 episodes 30\u2013132), the head of a family of petty criminals usually inside for burglary and theft. An antagonist of both Bea Smith and Monica Ferguson, Noeline was famous for her refusal to take anything she considered charity. In Noeline's words, \"The Burkes don't take charity, we just take.\" When she comes back to Wentworth she is very upset over Leanne Burke (see separate entry)'s death; she blames the officers for it and she doesn't understand that it was a tragic accident. She is later transferred to Barnhurst for her own safety. Note that Noeline's surname varies between Burke and Bourke in different sources; it is pronounced on-screen as \"Burke\".\n* '''Clara Goddard''' ([[Betty Lucas]] \u2013 episodes 30\u201339), a genteel, flighty socialite who initially planned to start a Halfway House for ex-prisoners, but ended up being remanded to Wentworth for embezzlement, where she gains considerable influence amongst the women, especially in the escaped Bea's absence. Sarcastically nicknamed \"Madame Clara\" and \"[[Tinker Bell|Tinkerbell]]\" by Bea when she returns, jealous of the way Clara manages to usurp her authority as top dog of the prisoners. During an examination of the running of the prison, the V.J. orders that Clara be moved to a dedicated remand section at Fairlea.\n* '''Kathleen Leach''' ([[Penny Stewart]]] \u2013 episodes 30\u2013149), beginning as a background prisoner (often uncredited), Kathleen went on to be involved with two notable plotlines. She is put in to share a cell with Ros Coulson in episode 80, in the middle of Ros planning to escape with terrorist Janet Dominguez. Kathleen tries to convince her not to, fearing that the terrorists will kill the officers, but Ros escapes anyway during the botched break-out. Kath is last seen during this storyline in episode 89, being questioned by the police, and presumably goes on to be released. The character returns in episode 143, seemingly arrested on a short sentence for prostitution, but has in fact been put inside as a plant by Tracey Morris' \"boyfriend\" Joe to make sure that Tracey will not testify against him. When Tracey realises that Joe has been using her, Kathleen is given orders to kill Tracey; unable to carry out the instructions, she goes to Bea for help. Bea purposely scolds Kathleen's hand in the laundry steam press (episode 147), putting Kathleen out of action and sending her off to hospital, with a valid \"excuse\" to her employers for being unable to carry out her orders. The last time she is seen is saying to Doreen that she can give her a fat lip if she sees her on the outside, due to a previous argument the two had in the recreation room earlier on.\n* '''Leanne Burke''' ([[Tracey-Jo Riley]])\u2013 episodes 33\u2013121), Noeline Burke's daughter, who has inherited her mother's criminal tendencies. She first is seen visiting Noeline with her rather slow brother Col ([[Brian Granrott]]) in episode 33, telling her about the problems they are facing without her. Leanne returns in episode 50, where her mother and she are caught trying to rob a building. Although Leanne escapes charge, Noeline is once again sent to Wentworth, and Leanne meets Welfare Officer Jean Vernon while visiting. Jean gives her the address of the apartment she shares with Meg if she needs guidance \u2013 only for Leanne to rob the place with a young man, Denny ([[Tony Mahood]]) she's met. However, Jean is determined to try to set Leanne on the straight and narrow, and convinces Meg to let Leanne move in with them while they find Leanne a steady job. Leanne constantly abuses this trust, infuriating Meg; Jean continually convinces Meg to give Leanne \"one more chance\", until eventually, in episode 55/6, Leanne and Denny are caught trying to hold up a service station. Leanne disappears from the series at this point, and it is not clear what she is charged with (she is not sent to Wentworth). The character finally arrives at Wentworth in episode 120 charged with [[petty larceny]]. Although some of the other women are sceptical of Leanne as she is Noeline's daughter, she quickly becomes good friends with Judy, and is very active with helping arrange the riot to demand that murderous officer Jock Stewart be brought to justice. However, in episode 121, when the riot takes to the prison roof, Leanne falls to her death while trying to wave a banner for the gathering media to see. Note that, like mother Noeline, Leanne's surname varies between Burke and Bourke in different sources; it is pronounced on-screen as \"Burke\".\n* '''Irene Zervos''' ([[Maria Mercedes (actor)|Maria Mercedes]] \u2013 episodes 38\u201340), a young Greek woman admitted to Wentworth after being blackmailed into prostitution by a relative who is aware of her status as an illegal immigrant. Matters are complicated further by the fact that Irene does not speak English, leaving Karen, with only a smattering of basic Greek, trying to translate for her.\n* '''Joyce Martin''' ([[Judy Nunn]] \u2013 episodes 40\u201348), the wife of an armed robber inside for being an accessory, and the only person who knows the location of the loot. After her husband forcibly tries to have her abducted from the prison grounds to force her into revealing the loot's location to him, Joyce makes a deal with Monica, who is due for release, for Monica to retrieve the stash in return for giving Monica a cut. Heavies hired by Joyce's husband try to snatch Monica, but mistakenly grab Lynn, who is released on the same day. The loot is eventually recovered when Jim Fletcher double-crosses Denise Crabtree (see below entry) to find the stashed key to unlock the loot. With the storyline having run its course, Joyce is moved to D Block in episode 48, the last time the character is seen.\n* '''Denise \"Blossom\" Crabtree''' ([[Lynda Keane]] \u2013 episodes 43\u201348), a tartly young woman who is the girlfriend of Monica Ferguson's husband Fred, but who turns out to be using him to get her hands on the stolen loot from the robbery committed by Joyce Martin's husband. When she winds up in Wentworth, Monica is angry to find that she has been having an affair with Fred; while Denise, when released, tries to seduce Jim Fletcher into helping her, after the key to the loot was stashed in the prison. However, Jim double-crosses her, and hands the loot into the police.\n* '''Edith \"Edie\" Wharton''' ([[Colleen Clifford]] \u2013 episodes 44\u201349), an elderly, kindly woman who is made homeless with her partner Horrie. Horrie dies after the pair spend the night sleeping rough, and Edith ends up charged with a minor vandalism crime (against the shelter who refused to take them in) and ends up in Wentworth charged with vagrancy. Edie's stay in the prison brings out the softer side of deputy governor Jim Fletcher, who goes out of his way to see that she is comfortable and cared for. Lizzie quickly strikes up a close friendship with her, and they enjoy talking about the old days. With a roof over her head, regular meals and with the new friends she has made, Edith does not want to leave Wentworth to go to the shabby bedsit that Jean Vernon has arranged, but dies in her sleep the night before she is due to be released, leaving Lizzie contemplating the prospect of dying in prison herself. With no relations or estate to pay for Edie's funeral, Jim Fletcher quietly steps in to pay for the funeral himself, out of the reward for recovering Joyce Martin's stolen loot.\n* '''Melinda Cross''' ([[Lulu Pinkus]] \u2013 episodes 47\u201358), a devious young woman, who is a student at the same university as Karen. She tries to blackmail Tom ([[Hu Pryce]]), her lecturer with whom she has been having an affair, with intimate pictures of her with him, demanding money else she will show the pictures to Tom's wife. When Tom's wife does find out, she informs the Police, and after being caught in the act receiving a pay-off, Melinda arrested and sent to Wentworth awaiting trial. She is pregnant with Tom's child, and after a brief spell in Wentworth, escapes conviction by convincing the Judge that she was only acting out of desperation of wanting the father of her baby. However, once released, she tells Greg (who has just opened up his own practice after leaving his job at the prison) that the story was just a convenient excuse, and that she plans to have an [[abortion]], putting Greg in an awkward position as it means that Melinda committed [[perjury]]. The newly released Karen very briefly moves in with Melinda, but after Melinda goes elsewhere to have an abortion after Greg refuses to help, and does it under Karen's name, Karen leaves to live elsewhere; this is the last time Melinda is seen in the series.\n* '''Bella Swan Albrecht''' ([[Liddy Clark]] \u2013 episodes 51\u201352), a remorseless child killer who had murdered her toddler daughter \u2013 which she saw as getting in the way of her securing a relationship \u2013 and arrives at Wentworth on remand. The officers attempt to keep her crime under wraps, knowing it will anger the other women, who despise those who harm children, but word soon leaks out after Bea dupes visiting psychologist Peter Clements into revealing why she is really in Wentworth. Although Bella tries to strike up a friendship with Karen, her only real 'friend' comes in Martha Eaves, feeling lonely after bullying by the other woman. Bella winds up attacked in the shower block and drowned in a wash basin; Martha is later found out to be the culprit. She's later mentioned in episode 277 by Lizzie when the women feel that a new prisoner who have arrived and placed in solitary that they aren't being told about or allowed to see due to possibly being dangerous. Lizzie then refers to the prisoner possibly doing something similar to Bella's crime of killing children due to her possibly doing something big they're not being led on about.\n* '''Antonia \"Toni\" McNally''' ([[Pat Bishop]] \u2013 episodes 57\u201364), a cool, classy woman on remand for the murder of the woman who was having an affair with her husband, and who tries to buy the women's favour and take over as top dog while Bea Smith is away in solitary confinement. Antonia is the wife of the head of the local underworld with friends in high places \u2013 amongst other things, she pulls strings to have Jim Fletcher given leave to get him off her back \u2013 and pressure is brought to bear on governor Erica Davidson to give her special privileges that further cements Toni's high status amongst the prisoners. Toni also starts smuggling in [[contraband]], including booze and drugs, and hires Martha Eaves as her muscle and lackey. When Bea is released from solitary, the two briefly strike up an uneasy alliance, until Bea learns that Toni has been smuggling in drugs, at which point the two become involved in a power struggle. By this point, though, Governor Davidson takes a temporary leave and the other women begin to side with Bea to go up against Vera Bennett and Jim Fletcher who are now in charge of the prison. Toni however refuses to take part in this. Shortly after, Antonia is sent for trial, but is let off Scot free after thugs hired by her intimidate the only witness into giving a false statement. Walking free from court, she is shot by Ros Coulson, the daughter the woman Toni killed, and dies soon after.\n* '''Roslyn Louise \"Ros\" Coulson''' ([[Sigrid Thornton]] \u2013 episodes 63\u201392), an idealistic young woman, in her last year at convent school, who first appears in episode 63 claiming to be a relation of Antonia McNally. However, Ros is actually the daughter of the woman McNally murdered. When McNally gets off Scot free, Ros fatally shoots her, seeing it as justified. Once sentenced, the gentle Ros's attitude quickly changes, as she believes she has done nothing wrong. She orchestrates an escape, arranging a distraction, allowing her to stow away in a visiting van. She seeks refuge at the newly opened halfway house, but \u2013 despite Doreen's pleas \u2013 Karen turns her away, telling her that if they were found harbouring a fugitive, it would destroy the whole project. Ros tries the [[brothel]] where her late mother worked, but when an associate of McNally's tries to force her into prostitution, she flees, and is captured soon after. Back in Wentworth, she is won over by terrorist Janet Dominquez, who plans to escape and offers to take Ros with her in return for Ros's help. But the terrorist break-out doesn't go as planned; Ros saves Governor Davidson from being fatally shot, and escapes on her own; following a tip-off from Chrissie, she is re-captured a while later. After this, Ros, with encouragement from Erica, begins to see that her attitude will not get her anywhere, and under the guidance of welfare officer Paul Reid, begins studying. To aid her in this, Erica has her moved to a quieter block with some other studying prisoners, in episode 92 \u2013 the last time the character is seen. When Doreen gets married at the prison in episode 116, she mentions asking permission for Ros to be a guest, but the character does not appear. In episode 158, while giving a pep talk to Doreen, Erica mentions that Ros got her qualification. She is lastly mentioned in episode 176 when prisoner Evelyn Randall offers Lizzie some of her homemade tea that helps a person sleep easily; to which Lizzie tells her how she wishes that can put the prison staff to sleep for a while like how Roslyn did in episode 81 with some drugs in an attempt to escape from Wentworth with terrorist Janet Dominguez (see below) that unfortunately went unsuccessful.\n* '''Patricia Mary Theresa \"Pat\" O'Connell''' ([[Monica Maughan]] \u2013 episodes 65\u2013110), a level headed, kind hearted middle-aged mother who is transferred from Barnhurst along with Chrissie Latham in episode 65. She is inside for aiding and abetting her criminal husband in an armed robbery (although, confusingly, on the character's first mention before her transfer, in episode 60, we hear that she is charged for driving a car through a shop window that had repossessed her furniture, something that is never mentioned again). Pat is being forced to go through with a divorce from her husband in order to give her a better chance of keeping her children, and is determined to keep out of trouble so that she might get her parole by Christmas and be reunited with her son and daughter, who are staying with her elderly mother who is finding it hard to cope with them. Despite jeopardising her parole by meeting with her eldest son David, who is also in prison and visiting Wentworth on a work party, Pat is paroled and reunited with her youngest children in time for Christmas. However, around this time David escapes from prison, which leads to a police shoot-out when he tries to visit her, resulting in Pat being returned to Wentworth when the police are convinced she was in cohorts with David, and leaving David jaded at Dr. Greg Miller, whom he is certain tipped the police off, prompting him to try to shoot Greg but getting Karen in error. Unable to cope in prison, David kills himself soon after. Pat's kind nature comes through when she insists that Bea not attack the pregnant Chrissie, and with both Doreen and Lizzie on release, she becomes Bea's main sidekick for a spell. Pat is eventually released when her sentence is reduced on appeal and she is given parole; she is last seen when Paul Reid drives her home with her kids.\n* '''Janet Rose Dominguez''' ([[Deidre Rubenstein]] \u2013 episodes 79\u201383), a terrorist brought to Wentworth awaiting extradition to the US to face charges in connection with the bombing of a South American official outside the UN building. She is held in solitary away from the other women, as the officers do not want her interacting with or influencing the other women, but she wins over Ros Coulson, who is being held in the adjoining solitary cell. Ros helps aid an escape and is given an instant sleep powder to drug the guards while armed terrorists brake into the prison to free Janet. However, the break-out does not go according to plan, and Dominguez is shot and wounded trying to escape. She is taken away from Wentworth on a stretcher soon after, accompanied by federal Police. She's mentioned in episode 277 by Lizzie after the women are surprised a letter they written and sent to be published in a newspaper wasn't published in it. This led to Lizzie believing that terrorist could have been responsible behind it and refers to Janet.\n* '''Caroline Margaret Simpson''' ([[Rosalind Speirs]] \u2013 episodes 89\u2013114), arrives at the Halfway House with her fragile mother Vivienne (see below entry), who is seeking shelter from her abusive husband but is turned away. Soon after, when her father's violent temper boils over and he threatens to kill her mother with a shotgun, Caroline fatally stabs him. Caroline convinces Vivienne that they must say intruders killed him, but their story is soon exposed and they end up in Wentworth awaiting trial. Once inside, Officer Jim Fletcher shows an interest in Caroline, subtlety at first, but it is soon noticed by the other women (reinforcing his nickname \"Fletch the Letch\"), although Caroline does not return his advances. Caroline's estranged, possessive ex-husband Michael ([[Peter Ford (actor)|Peter Ford]]) offers to pay bail, but she refuses to bow down to his terms; while Michael becomes jaded at Jim, whom he sees as coming between Caroline and himself. Although Jim also offers to pay bail, Caroline refuses, not wanting to be in his debt, but when Vivienne's frail state of health worsens, Caroline finally agrees. Eventually Jim bails Caroline too; when she moves into the Halfway House, she continues seeing him and she finally returns his advances, and the pair begin a romantic relationship, even though Jim is breaking the terms of Caroline's bail. When Michael and Geoff Butler ([[Ray Meagher]]) (who is bitter at Jim for turning him in to the police over a previous incident) join forces, Butler dupes Michael \u2013 who insists that he wants no-one badly hurt \u2013 into delivering a bomb to Jim's motel room, it kills Jim's wife and children. This puts a severe strain on Caroline and Jim's relationship, with him telling her after the explosion that he blames her. But when Vivienne and Caroline finally go to trial, and are released on good behaviour bonds, she visits him one last time and they part on reasonable terms. This parting scene with Jim, before she goes to stay with Michael's sister, is Caroline's last appearance in the series. Note: Although billed as Caroline, many characters, including her own mother, pronounced her name as ''Carolyn''.\n* '''Vivienne Anne Williams''' ([[Bernadette Gibson]] episodes 89\u2013114), the mother of Caroline (see above entry), who is suffering at the hands of her abusive husband. After Caroline kills him in self-defence, the pair arrive at Wentworth, where Vivienne's fragile health worsens. Eventually, it is Lizzie (who at the time is on release and visits to see Bea) who recognises Vivienne and Caroline from seeking shelter at the Halfway House, adding some support to their claims of abuse, and Vivienne is released awaiting trial. However, once home, the strain of events is too much for Vivienne and she tries to commit [[suicide]], after which she is put into a care home, not seen for a few episodes. Eventually, in episode 114, Vivienne and Caroline come up for trial, and their charges are reduced to [[manslaughter]], allowing them to be freed on good behaviour bonds.\n* '''Sharon Gilmour''' ([[Margot Knight]] \u2013 episodes 90\u2013116), a scheming, spoiled young woman who is imprisoned for drug dealing after a Police raid where she was selling dope to a group of youths (including Social Worker Paul Reid's son Tony ([[John Higginson]])). Being a drug dealer, not to mention a vindictive trouble-stirrer, Sharon immediately becomes an enemy of Bea. Despite having a lover, Judy Bryant (see separate entry), on the outside, Sharon becomes involved in a romantic relationship with Chrissie Latham, and the pair work together for a time to become Top Dog(s) while Bea is in isolation. Jealous of this romantic relationship, Judy purposely gets herself arrested so she can be inside with Sharon, but Sharon uses her spiteful ways to manipulate Judy as she does with everyone else. With Chrissie moved to maternity to be with her baby, Sharon later starts vicious rumours that Kerry Vincent (see separate entry) is a \"lagger\" (informant) after Kerry turns down her romantic advances. Judy finally becomes tired of Sharon's scheming, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] ways and puts an end to their relationship. When Sharon witnesses corrupt officer Jock Stewart ([[Tommy Dysart]]) blackmailing and physically attacking Doreen, she tries to strike up working deal with him \u2013 she'll keep quiet about what she has seen in return for him protecting her. But soon after, she is found at the bottom of a flight of stairs with her neck broken. Judy, Bea and Kerry are all suspects, but it was Jock who murdered her.\n* '''Judith Francis \"Judy\" Bryant''' ([[Betty Bobbitt]] \u2013 episodes 91-534), an American ex-pat lesbian who deliberately committed a crime to join her lover Sharon Gilmour in prison. She was initially an agitator, but later became one of Bea's allies, as well as a long-term inmate.  Judy ran Driscoll House, a Half-Way House for ex-criminals to get back on their feet.  Judy was sent back to Wentworth after helping friend, Hazel Kent, kill herself while she was suffering from a terminal brain tumour. Served as a sort of \"deputy Top Dog,\" to both Bea and Myra. She was later released to become a successful songwriter.\n* '''Lilian \"Lil\" Stokes''' ([[Judith McLorinan]] \u2013 episodes 91\u2013392), The smaller one of Margo Gaffney's goons. Most of her appearances come without a speaking part. she is first seen in episode 91 briefly in the background with Margo Gaffney's bigger goon: Bev Covelli. Lil has her first big scene when she helps Margo and Bev give Sharon a \"haircut\". In her last appearance she dies when the prison is under quarantine, in deputy governor Colleen Powell's arms.\n* '''Margo Jane Gaffney''' ([[Jane Clifton]] \u2013 episodes 92\u2013448), one of a long line of agitators in the prison cell block who generally played rival to the reigning top-dog. Margo took charge of all gambling inside Wentworth and was usually accompanied by her stooges \"Lil and Bev\" (played by extras Judith McLorinan and Kaye Chadwick). Margo went back and forth during the series run from a good to bad guy, usually leaning toward the bad side.  One of Margo's most heinous acts was the bashing of guard Meg Morris, who was temporarily a prisoner for contempt of court, and this earned her the combined wrath of Bea and Chrissie (who ironically saved Meg, despite her killing Meg's first husband, Bill Jackson), and avenged her bashing, by tying her up and tarring and feathering her in the lavatory.  Margo was also later bashed by Bea and Chrissie when it was discovered that she set the storeroom on fire with a [[Molotov cocktail]] at Wentworth, thus beginning the Great Fire at Wentworth, and lied about it to the cops. She later tries to frame Reb for attacking Myra Desmond but is found out and transferred to Blackmoore. Note: In the character's second appearance, in episode 93, her surname is given as Dempsey, not Gaffney.\n* '''Bernadette''' ([[Anne Phelan]] \u2013 episodes 94\u201395), A dopey background prisoner who appears to be good mates with Top Dog: Bea Smith.\n* '''Heather \"Mouse\" Trapp''' ([[Jentah Sobott]] \u2013 episodes 106*-326), a rather timid young woman in and out for Wentworth for petty crime. She escapes and goes on the run with Judy Bryant after crawling through the tunnel during the pantomime. Later she returns to Wentworth and gets mixed up in the plans for the Great fire where she perishes in the flames and burns to death. * \u2013 Note: although first credited in episode 106, Sobott had been appearing as an uncredited extra in the series for some time beforehand (first seen in Episode 67). The character \u2013 with no dialogue \u2013 is first referred to as \"Mouse\" in episode 100.\n* '''Kerry Vincent''' ([[Penny Downie]] \u2013 episodes 112\u2013124), a young prisoner transferred to Wentworth to give her room to let her artistic talent flourish. Some of the women are sceptical of the special treatment that Kerry is given, such as being given a double cell to herself to give her room to do her paintings. Bea in particular does not take to her after she finds that Kerry's transfer was arranged by Ken Pearce ([[Tom Oliver]]), whom Bea has developed a crush on. As we learn more about Kerry, we hear that she is a former prostitute who is inside after violently attacking a client. Kerry's agent is David Austin ([[Rod Mullinar]]), a smarmy art dealer who is exploiting Kerry's status as a prisoner to drum up publicity and sell her work for huge profit. Kerry tries to get on with the other women, but they turn on her when malicious Sharon Gilmour starts spreading rumours of her being a \"lagger\" (informant) after Kerry turned down her romantic advances. During this period, Kerry also gives Vera a painting that she intends to destroy, only for Austin to concoct a story of Vera bribing it out of Kerry, in order to give him more publicity, nearly costing Vera her job until Jock Stewart helps her set things straight with Austin; as a result, Austin is banned from visiting her at Wentworth. Kerry is given parole in episode 117 and set up in a small studio flat, but only on the proviso that she does not see Austin, but Kerry is oblivious to his manipulating her and continues seeing him, and becomes jealous of other women he is seeing. This leads her to several drunken benders, the last of which results in her smashing David over the head with an ashtray, causing her to think she has killed him. She plans to flee the area; Helen Smart (see separate entry)'s [[pimp]] sells her some drugs to calm her down, but she takes them with alcohol, nearly killing her. When David finds her in this state, instead of calling for medical aid, he takes her paintings instead. Helen discovers Kerry and alerts Parole Officer Paul Reid just in time; after she is out of danger, he arranges that her parole not be cancelled if she agrees to be treated in a [[sanatorium]]. Kerry agrees to this, and it is the last time she is seen in the series.\n* '''Helen Pamela Smart''' ([[Caroline Gillmer]] \u2013 episodes 118\u2013441), a likeable, amusing prostitute frequently sent to Wentworth for soliciting who becomes a useful contact for the women on the outside.

Her younger sister Sharon becomes involved with a cult so Helen kidnaps her and tries to de-programme her. Sharon stabs and murders one man who was helping causing Helen to be admitted to Wentworth for kidnapping \u2013 her first offence other than prostitution. She later develops a tropical disease brought in by Glynis Ladd whilst Wentworth is under quarantine. She was sent to Barnhurst after her trial.

She is sent to Wentworth on remand, where she instantly faces the anger of the other women when they find what she is in for, branding her a \"baby basher\". Eventually, a talk from Captain Barton (standing in for the departed Paul Reid) convinces her to stand up for herself; she gives an emotional speech to the other women telling them how she simply could not cope but loves her children, after which the women ease up on her. Gail goes to trial and is given a suspended sentence, on condition that she seek help. She moves away to join a support group.\n* '''Kay Frances White''' ([[Sandy Gore]] \u2013 episodes 127\u2013145), the sly administrator of Andrew Reynolds's clothing factory, where a work scheme has been arranged with Wentworth for some of the prisoners. Kay places several large bets with bookie Margo (and holds out on paying up the money she owes), and agreeing to help Judy make a dress for an escape attempt. With suspicion on her for a series of thefts from the factory, she sets up Noeline to take the blame, to try to get Mr. Reynolds off of her back. Soon after, her long-running embezzlement of company funds, to fund her compulsive gambling habit, is uncovered when she \"borrows\" payroll money to place a large bet, in hope of making back the money she has taken from the company, but she is caught in the act, and sent to Wentworth awaiting trial. There, she tries to use her gambling addiction as a claim that she needs psychiatric help in order to escape charge, but having got on the wrong side of the women over the cancellation of the work programme, and her generally manipulative attitude, Bea orchestrates a scheme to expose that Kay is still willingly gambling; the plot is successful, and Kay does not escape charge, returning to Wentworth as an inmate with a five-year sentence. But from this point, Kay's manner only get more extreme \u2013 she opens her own book to overtake Margo's, and using very heavy-handed methods to secure bets. This leads to Bea being sent to solitary after giving Kay a \"bashing\", and in Bea's absence, Kay makes a move to be Top Dog. Judy, with help from Lizzie and others, plan to put Kay's racket out of action by placing large bets that she can't possibly afford to cover. After this backfires, they record a dog race from the radio on Tracey Morris's tape recorder, place a huge bet with Kay (knowing the outcome) and doctor the newspaper's racing page accordingly, and play the tape back next day as if it were live. The scheme works, but when Kay \"borrows\" Tracey's tape recorder and realises she's been set up, she goes frantic and violently attacks Lizzie in her cell, nearly strangling her until Linda Jones smashes Kay over the head with a kettle jug to save Lizzie, leaving Kay unconscious and covered in blood. She later dies from a blood clot on the brain. Lizzie stows Linda away from the scene and insist that she herself must take the blame (for more on this, see Linda Jones's profile, below).\n* '''Linda Mary Jones''' ([[Elaine Cusick]]) \u2013 episodes 140\u2013150), first introduced as an existing prisoner who is working as a runner for Margo's betting racket, Linda also has concerns when her son Danny ([[Darren Sole]]) is unhappy living with her overbearing, bullying sister while she is inside and runs away. Officer Fletcher later tracks down Danny and offers to take him in to live with him until Linda gets her parole; Danny's behaviour at first causes some trouble, but Jim soon licks him into shape and the pair form a close bond. Meanwhile, Kay White, starting her own more heavy-handed bookie racket, forces Linda into acting as runner for her, something that Linda reluctantly does. When the women try to put Kay out of action with a gambling con, Kay flips out at Lizzie and tries to strangle her in her cell; Linda arrives and smashes Kay over the head with a kettle jug, leaving Kay unconscious. Lizzie manages to stow Linda away before any officers arrive on the scene, and insists that she take the wrap for it instead, both in return for Linda saving her life, and concerned about her being reunited with Danny. Linda insists she tell Erica what really happened, but Lizzie insists she keep quiet. Kay later dies, but Lizzie convinces the V.J. that she was behind Kay's injuries, allowing Linda to get her parole and be reunited with Danny, leaving to live in the new apartment that Danny and Jim have organised. However, a few episodes after Linda's departure, a jaded Doreen goes to Mrs. Davidson and tries to tell her the real circumstances of Kay's death. Erica sends Jim Fletcher to visit Linda and question her, but she convinces him that Lizzie's version is correct. She attends Lizzie's trial, where Lizzie \u2013 expecting an 18-month extension to her sentence for manslaughter \u2013 is given a heavy sentence.\n* '''Tracey Morris''' ([[Sue Devine]] \u2013 episodes 141\u2013198) & (Michelle Thomas \u2013 episodes 463\u2013464), a young woman on remand accused of smuggling heroin into Australia but claims that she was set up by her gangster boyfriend.

A generally decent sort, later episodes show Hazel as being a depressed, drunken loser, turning to the bottle after her partner leaves her for another woman, taking their children with him. Hazel was suffering from a brain tumour and asked Judy Bryant to give her an overdose \u2013 leading to Judy's return to Wentworth for her final stint.\n* '''Sarah Forrest / Jacqueline Mary \"Jacki\" Nolan''' ([[Diane Craig]] \u2013 episodes 149\u2013159), a classy, sophisticated and well spoken women that Jim meets at a party. They arrange to see more of each other, and, trying to impress her and not put her off about his job, Jim tells her that he works as a building contractor. Sarah is part-owner of an interior design business, and offers Jim a business deal, much to the disdain of Sarah's haughty partner, Julian ([[Peter Stratford]]). After Sarah and Jim spend the night together, Sarah finds Jim's Prison Officer jacket and flees, and when he visits her at the interior design business, she is very cold towards him and tells him that the relationship is over. At the same time, Erica is thinking of having some home decorating done, and Meg mentions that she has heard Jim has an interior design friend. Although Jim tries to put her off, Erica visits Sarah's business and seems to recognise her. Soon after, she realises that she is actually Jacki Nolan, who escaped from Barnhurst a few years previously, and is now using Sarah Forrest as an alias. Erica convinces Jim to try to persuade Jacki to turn herself in; Jim is unsure what to do and stalls, but Jacki turns herself in on her own accord. Sent to Wentworth, Sarah and Jim try to play down their relationship to both Erica and the other inmates. Jim joins Erica at a Prisoners Reform Group meeting, where the group comes up with a high-profile publicity campaign to get Jacki pardoned \u2013 insisting that she has self-rehabilitated and that her successful business proves this \u2013 amongst other propaganda. But Julia has his own campaign to get Jacki pardoned, and warns Jim to keep away else it will ruin the whole petition. Jacki faces going back to Barnhurst, but she is loath to as she was molested by a bullying lesbian officer (who some fans have theorised may have been Joan Ferguson) during her previous sentence, hence her escape in the first place. With increasing media attention over the case, Jacki is just about to be transferred to Barnhurst when her pardon comes through. She leaves Wentworth, presumably to resume running the business with Julian, and never to see Jim again.\n* '''Myra June Desmond''' ([[Anne Phelan]] \u2013 episodes 154\u2013552), a former prisoner who had worked with the Prison Reform Group before arriving back at Wentworth and replacing Bea Smith as the show's second long-running \"top dog\". She was a thoughtful but strong woman who gave up her own life for the safety of the other hostages during The Ballanger Siege. Before the siege, Desmond organised a scheme to set up Joan Ferguson by bashing Lou Kelly and then framing Joan for the assault. The scheme worked until inmate Anita Selby revealed the truth to then-Governor Ann Reynolds. Reynolds then reinstated Ferguson and introduced a stricter security regime at the prison. She later confronted Desmond and told her that she would no longer recognise her as top dog. She also threatened Desmond with a transfer to Blackmoor if she caused any more trouble.\n* '''Anne Griffin''' ([[Rowena Wallace]] \u2013 episodes 160\u2013167), a seemingly meek, timid young woman sent to Wentworth for robbing a shopkeeper and knife-point. She insists that she is innocent, and the money found on her when she was arrested was loaned to her by her friend Megan; however, no trace (or even proof of existence) can be found of Megan and so with no alibi, Anne is to await trial. Soon after Anne's arrival, Bea is attacked from behind in the corridor, and it eventually emerges that Anne was responsible (not liking Bea's authority over the other inmates); Bea plans her revenge but Judy persuades her to hold off, convincing her that Anne is mentally unwell. Anne tries to convince the authorities that Megan has written to her, giving her the alibi she needs, but it turns out that Anne wrote the letter herself. As Erica realises that Anne needs psychiatric help, various details come to light about Anne's abusive upbringing, her imaginary friend Megan, and the baby she later had that died, also called Megan, which has left Anne in a very confused state. Anne is inside during the big tunnel escape plan of the end of the 1980 season; after the other woman realise Anne is unreliable, they try to cover up all proof of the escape plans, telling her it was merely a prank, in fear that she might inform the officers. Things come to a head during the escape attempt (165); Judy, Mouse, Doreen and another inmate; Irene Nagel, make their escape, but Lizzie decides at the last minute to join Doreen, leading both her down into the tunnels, and Bea after her trying to call her back. As the tunnels collapse, trapping Bea, Lizzie and the injured Doreen, Anne deliberately covers the cover to the tunnel (with a \"grave\" for Megan) to stop them from getting out, leaving them trapped in the collapsed tunnel for several days. Eventually Mouse is recaptured, and raises the alarm, leading the officers to rescue Bea and co. Bea plans to kill Anne for what she did, but Dr. Weisman by this time certifies her to be mentally unbalanced, and she is led away to a psychiatric hospital before Bea can exact her revenge.\n* '''Irene Nagel''' (Heather Howard - episode 165), An inmate who joins in on the escape from Wentworth at the last minute. She was mentioned by Judy as being in on the escape in episode 163, though her name was mentioned way before in episode 126 as one of the first of the women to attend the Reynolds clothing factory job. She didn't speak any lines and just followed the escape instructions with the other escapees. She was the one who inadvertently caused the tunnel collapsed by slipping and grabbing hold of an old rickety support beam that couldn't hold her weight. The tunnel collapsed, killing her. It's implied that her body was dug out and in episode 167, Erika Davidson was on the phone to inform one of her relatives of her death.\n* '''Sandra \"Sandy\" Hamilton''' ([[Candy Raymond]] \u2013 episodes 173\u2013180), a new prisoner who arrives claiming to be inside for the first time after being caught driving with expired tax. However, Bea and others soon become suspicious as, for a supposed first timer, Sandra seems very familiar with prisoner etiquette, and asks a lot of questions, particularly around and concerning Judy. They suspect her to be an undercover Police officer after information about Judy's recent escape and recapture, heightened even more when she convinces the Governor to move her into Judy's cell, and she even tries making seductive advances towards Judy; but after Bea and Judy put the heavy on her, she confesses that she is actually a newspaper [[journalist]] who deliberately got herself put inside to try to get the [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] on Judy's escape. When Evelyn Randall (see below profile) arrives in episode 175, Sandra offers to write an article about how Evelyn has been unjustly imprisoned in return for Evelyn getting information with her; when Bea and the women plant Evelyn's stolen file in Sandra's cell, Sandra is sent to isolation. When the prison is struck by an unidentified disease (episodes 177\u2013179), and the isolation cells needed to bed [[quarantine]]d officers, Sandra is returned to the women, where she becomes very scared of becoming infected, after seeing her mother waste away some years earlier, and even tries to escape during a food pick-up, leaving Jim Fletcher threatening to shoot her if she does not return, for fear of her infecting people outside the prison. With the mysterious disease \"cured\" in episode 179, Sandra finds herself framed for scarring Evelyn in a fire [[booby trap]] under Evelyn's bed, which will stop any chances of her imminent release; Sandra strikes up a deal with Bea, for Bea to prove she was innocent, in return for Sandra writing an expos\u00e9 on poor prison conditions when she is released. However, after she is released in 180, she instead writes a story written around her and her time inside, neglecting to mention the conditions she promised to expose.\n* '''Evelyn Randall''' ([[Julia Blake]] \u2013 episodes 175\u2013179; seen in recap of 180), referred to as 'Evie' only by Lizzie, she is an eccentric, middle-aged [[herbalist]] who arrives with other new prisoners Jenny Armstrong and Georgie Baxter (see separate profiles). She has been accused of manslaughter after poisoning one of her patients, but insists that she is innocent, and has a grudge against conventional medicine, insisting that everyone should see that herbal remedies are the true cure. Her haughty attitude soon gets Bea's back up, but most of the other prisoners take a liking her, annoying Bea even more. When an under-the-weather Doreen asks Evelyn for a remedy, she falls ill, leading Bea to believe that Evelyn has poisoned her; but Evelyn finds that Doreen has mistakenly heated the remedy first, which has resulted in Doreen falling sick. Soon after, a mysterious bug breaks out in the prison; it is assumed to be a tropical disease brought in by Jenny Armstrong, who had just returned from overseas. As many prisoners and officers fall dangerously ill and Wentworth is quarantined, Evelyn insists that her herbal remedies could find a cure, as conventional doctors struggle to find the cause. The other prisoners even start to believe her, when one of her secretly brewed remedies begins to heal the very ill Meg; but it eventually emerges that Evelyn was behind the \"disease\", lacing people's food with enough special ingredients to cause them to fall sick, giving her the opportunity to \"heal them\" and prove herself. When the other women find out, Bea insists that they do not take action straight away, instead biding their time and making Evie nervous. But a booby trap fire using [[Turpentine|turps]] placed under Evelyn's bed badly scalds her, seeing her led away to hospital in episode 179. She is not seen after this because Erica organised a transfer to Barnhurst for the day after, and although Bea was aware that the booby trap was placed, it was only designed that it would scare her. It is never fully revealed how Evie came to be so badly scalded, although is suggested that Bea did not authorise the incident.\n* '''Jennie Armstrong''' ([[Sally Cooper]] \u2013 episode 175), a young, naive prisoner brought to Wentworth at the same time as Georgie Baxter and Evie Randall, and emerges from the prison truck covered in blood and terrified after being attacked by Georgie. While in the prison hospital recovering, she explains to Lizzie that she is only in prison after not paying a minor traffic fine, thinking that prison sounded \"fun\".

Later in the episode Sally is found to have hanged herself. The show's first Halfway House (a boarding house for recently released prisoners) is later named in her honour.\n* '''Frieda Joan \"Franky\" Doyle''' ([[Carol Burns]] \u2013 episode 1\u201320), an agitating [[lesbian]] [[motorcycle|bikie]] who suffers ferocious outbursts when she becomes angry. Her violent attitude stems in part from the fact that she is [[illiterate]]. She falls in love with fellow inmate Karen Travers, who does not appreciate her advances; however, the pair eventually strike up a friendship when Karen begins teaching Franky how to read. Despite her immense popularity with viewers, Franky appears in only the first 20 episodes (due to actress Carol Burns choosing to leave as the series was extended from a sixteen-part serial to an ongoing soap opera); after her brother Gary ([[Greg Stroud]]) is killed in a tractor accident, and feeling jaded by Karen after Franky takes her friendship to mean something more, Franky escapes the prison with Doreen and Lizzie. Although Lizzie is forced to turn back due to her weak heart, Franky and Doreen go on the run, even posing as nuns before Franky is shot dead by a Policeman. Despite Franky's short run on the show, the character is mentioned numerous times over the next couple of hundreds of episodes.\n* '''Karen Mary Travers''' (n\u00e9e Healy) ([[Peta Toppano|Peita Toppano]] \u2013 episode 1\u201380), a middle-class school-teacher who had stabbed her abusive, adulterous husband to death. Initially Karen offers up little defence for her actions (which had led to her being given a life sentence), only later does it emerge that, as well as the physical and mental abuse she refused to report, she had returned from having the [[abortion]] that her husband had forced her to have, only to find him in bed with another woman, which ultimately sees her sentence reduced to two years. Arriving at the prison, as well as being intimidated by the [[sexual harassment]] of Franky Doyle (whom she later manages to befriend), she is reunited with Dr. Greg Miller, who is now working as the prison doctor at Wentworth, whom she previously had a close relationship with before getting married. The pair have a close friendship within Wentworth at times, but also grow apart during the course of the 1979 season. With her sentence reduced, Karen is permitted to have day release to study at University; during this time she has a brief relationship with lawyer Steve Wilson, who defends her in court. Although given a two-year sentence, Karen is given parole from Wentworth by the end of the 1979 season. After several false starts, she is befriended by prisoner rights campaigner Angela Jeffries ([[Jeanie Drynan]]), who ultimately puts Karen in charge of the show's first Halfway House. Karen runs the house for a short time towards the end of the 1979 season, with the newly released Doreen Anderson as the first tenant, but during this time, Greg confesses his love for her and the two resume their relationship. In the 1979 season finale, Karen is shot by Pat O'Connell (see separate entry)'s son David, who believes that Greg was responsible for his mother's re-arrest and mistakenly shoots Karen instead of Greg. With Karen narrowly escaping death and badly scared, Greg makes plans for them to start afresh in Queensland; Karen is last seen in episode 80, recovering from her wounds; Greg (and, off-screen, Karen) leaving the series a few episodes later. When Greg makes a brief return appearance in episode 107, we hear that Karen is recovering well and the pair have now married. She's lastly mentioned in episode 201 by a psychiatrist who tries to jog back Bea's memory who ended up with a serious case of [[amnesia]] from a car accident from her transfer back to Wentworth after her temporal stay at Barnhurst.\n* '''Lynnette Jane \"Lynn\" Warner \u2013 \"Wonk\"''' ([[Kerry Armstrong]] \u2013 episode 1\u201344), a young, rather na\u00efve country girl who had come to the city to work as a nanny and arrived at Wentworth protesting her innocence at having kidnapped the baby in her care and buried him alive. She was brutally initiated into prison life, when Bea Smith, upon hearing about her crime, burned her hand \"accidentally\" with the press, giving rise to one of Prisoner's most iconic scenes. Lynn gains the nickname \"Wonky Warner\" (or just \"Wonk\") from some of the other women, especially Doreen, due to her being perceived as mentally unbalanced due to her supposed crimes. It is eventually discovered that the child's own mother had buried the child alive; clearing Lynn of her accused crime. However, upon her release, Lynn runs away from her parents' farm with Doug Parker, also an ex-convict, whom she marries, and reluctantly becomes involved with an armed hold-up, which leaves Doug dead and Lynn back inside (as well as losing the unborn baby she was carrying after being raped as a nanny). During her second spell in Wentworth, she became part of the new work release programme, working during the day at a local garden centre for Syd Butterfield ([[Alan Rowe (australian actor)|Alan Rowe]]), and getting close with Syd's son Geoffrey ([[David Cameron (actor)|David Cameron]]) in the process, much to the chagrin of Syd. Both Lynn's work programme and parole are jeopardised when she is caught trying to smuggle letters out of the prison, which she insists she has never seen before. It eventually emerges that they were planted by Doreen, who has developed a crush on Lynn, and is scared of her leaving her. After serving her time, Lynn is finally released again, though on her release day, is kidnapped by thugs who confused her with Monica Ferguson (who is released on the same day and who knew the whereabouts of some stolen loot). After being rescued by the Police, Lynn presumably returns to her parents' farm, and this is the last we see of the character (we hear of her sending a Christmas present to Doreen in episode 75). She is lastly mentioned in episode 203 by return prisoner Jeanette \"Mum\" Brooks (see below) who mentions Bea burning her hand on the steam press when Mum, according to her solicitor, believes she has to bring up some events about Bea during their time together in Wentworth to help explain why she was too anxious to go to the police when Bea arrived at her house with amnesia in episode 199. This was to help them in their court case as Mum intentionally wanted to help Bea get herself together before she had to be turned in, aiding a prisoner which led to her second re-arrest.\n* '''Gladys Anne \"Marilyn\" Mason''' ([[Margaret Laurence (actor)|Margaret Laurence]] \u2013 episode 1\u201316), the prison nymphomaniac, inside for soliciting and chiefly memorable for her erotic assignations with electrician Eddie Cook ([[Richard Moir]]) in the prison roof. Upon release, she moves in with Eddie, determined to get a decent job and go straight, but, hard up for money, reluctantly turns back to prostitution, leading to a bust up with Eddie and being sent to Wentworth once again. As Marilyn is released a second time, Bea eventually sets the pair straight, convincing Monica Ferguson to let them run her [[milk bar]]. We hear in episodes 42\u201344 of Monica selling the shop to Marilyn and Eddie, and they presumably happily continue running it. During a storyline in which Bea becomes attracted to prison visitor Ken Pearce ([[Tom Oliver]]) between episodes 105 and 116, there are several references to Marilyn and Eddie's romantic liaisons in the prison.\n* '''Doreen May Anderson (later Burns)''' ([[Colette Mann]] \u2013 episodes 1\u2013446), a childish and easily led, but generally well-meaning prisoner who was briefly involved in a sexual relationship with Franky Doyle. Thumb-sucking, teddy-bear-clutching Doreen was a petty criminal, in and out of juvenile institutions before ending up at Wentworth, with a particular talent for forgery. After Franky's death, she became close friends with Lizzie and Bea; their friendship was one of the driving forces behind the first 300 episodes' success. She was released twice in the series; after her first release she is arrested for stealing, and on her second, she steals Chrissie's baby from the hospital. In 1980 during the time she was out of the prison, she fell in love with Kevin Burns whom she married, but they were divorced not long after she was raped during her second stint in the prison during a work release scheme. The end of her marriage nearly caused her to commit suicide. She was the first victim of the Freak's 'black glove' treatment in 1982, just prior to her release. She made a few appearances in 1983 when, during Bea's escape, Doreen put her up in Sydney. Although the first to initially leave the series of the main three, she was also the last to be seen \u2013 when in 1984, she got herself put back in prison to try to avoid a marriage she had somehow agreed too, her return was more as comic relief and to bring back an old favourite following the departures of Lizzie and Bea.\n* '''Elizabeth Josephine \"Lizzie\" Birdsworth''' (n\u00e9e Cameron) ([[Sheila Florance]] \u2013 episodes 1\u2013418, featured in flashback in episode 420), an elderly, chain-smoking, alcoholic recidivist prisoner, who provided much of the series comic relief. At the series start, Lizzie had already served twenty years in prison. Working as a bush cook, she had in a drunken rage allegedly poisoned a group of six sheep shearers who'd had the audacity to complain about her cooking, with four of them dying. It was later learned someone else had added the fatal dose of poison to the food (she put in enough to make them sick) and Lizzie was released and awarded compensation. Unfortunately she was ill-equipped to fend for herself outside and quickly committed a series of crimes and was returned to prison. A fraud and her daughter looking for money pretended to be Lizzie's family which Paul Reid and Kevin Burns discover. We later find out Lizzie knew all along that they weren't her real family and she wanted to spend time with them. Marcia (Lizzie's fake daughter) tells Lizzie that she was her daughter's best friend at the orphanage and that Lizzie's real daughter died in a car crash. The fake family: Marcia and Josie later left to go to the United States where Josie was to undergo an operation. Lizzie was recognisable for her always present red cardigan sweater given to her early on in the show's run by the prison's governor, Erica Davidson. Lizzie suffered from several heart attacks and during her final time in hospital she was released to be with her real family: The Charlton's.\n\n* {{anchor|Bea Smith}}'''Beatrice Alice \"Bea\" Smith''' ([[Val Lehman]] \u2013 episodes 1\u2013400),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwwentworth.co.uk/bea.htm|title=Bea Smith (Val Lehman)|accessdate=5 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010130031100/http://www.wwwentworth.co.uk/bea.htm|archivedate=30 January 2001}}</ref> the first ever top dog \u2013 the name given to the uncaring and sadistic leader of the prisoner population \u2013 who rules Wentworth's H Block with an iron fist. Bea was initially imprisoned for strangling her husband's mistress and then shot dead her cheating husband upon her release. Her teenage daughter Debbie (played by Val Lehman's real-life daughter Cassandra) had died from a heroin overdose in 1977 while Bea was in prison, after Bea's husband had evicted her from his home. Because of her daughters' death, Bea was renowned for her hatred of drug pushers and her hatred of prisoners who commit crimes against children which everyone followed her hatred.  This characteristic, which is common in all prisons, was evident when Bea slammed the hot steam press on Lynn Warner's hand. Her hatred towards both drug pushers and users softens later in the series where she attempts to help a fellow inmate to beat her drug addiction. She and Chrissie Latham were enemies at first (as Chrissie was originally on Franky Doyle' side in the first riot) but later, they became allies, especially against Margo Gaffney. Bea was Joan Ferguson's first of three major enemies. Any chance of Bea's parole was foiled after shooting and killing Nola Mckenzie in a hospital bed. Bea escaped a total of 3 times throughout the series, although the second escape was unplanned. Bea's last rival for top dog was Sonia Stevens. Bea was transferred to Barnhurst, and her reign of terror at Wentworth's H Block is finally over. There are many references after Bea's transfer especially when Lizzie compares Bea's top dog qualities to Minnie Donovan's top dog qualities including the code of lagging when Minnie lagged on Sonia Stevens in a plan to soil Joan Ferguson. Bea writes a letter saying \"Vinegar Tits is worse than ever\" when Cass is transferred from Barnhurst Lizzie says \"our best mate Bea Smith was transferred\" Cass said that she heard Bea arrived. In episodes 536\u2013537 we hear there was a Barnhurst riot and there were 8 transfers Myra ask Nora Flynn if they brought Bea. Nora tells Myra that she was killed in the riot trying to stop it, but Ann tells Meg that she \"burnt\" to death. Bea's death was probably the biggest killed-off screen events of the show as many viewers assumed that there was hope that Val Lehman would return to the show though the actress claimed she refused several offers.\n* '''Jeanette Mary \"Mum\" Brooks''' ([[Mary Ward (actress)|Mary Ward]] \u2013 episode 1\u2013204), an elderly, dignified long-term inmate who worked in the prison garden, well loved and respected by both prisoners and officers. \"Mum\" had committed euthanasia on her terminally ill husband and had served fifteen years at the start of the series.  She helped with making newcomers to Wentworth get used to the prison routine. In Episode 2, she is released, but has nowhere to live, and after spending a brief spell living with her daughter, Lorraine Watkins ([[Anne Charleston]]), who cannot accept that Mum killed her father and does not like an ex-criminal being around her family, Mum shoplifts to deliberately get sent back to Wentworth. However, by Episode 16, she is again released, this time under the care of new parole officer Jean Vernon, who sets Mum up in a little flat with her pregnant granddaughter Judith-Ann ([[Kim Deacon]]) (whom Mum grew close to during her awkward stint living with her daughter), at which point Mum is written out of the series (as with Carol Burns, Mary Ward did not wish to commit to an ongoing serial). However, Mum and Judith-Ann appear again in episodes 30\u201333, when they unwittingly become involved with the escaped Bea (this storyline was conceived in part after requests from viewers to see what had happened to Mum). Mum and Judith-Anne are visited again in a storyline running from episode 61\u201367. Mum is in poor health, but overworking in order to support Judith-Anne's imminent birth. Meg (who is still visiting Mum) convinces Greg to tend to her, who in turn, convinces Karen (now released) to stay with Mum and Judith after Mum's short spell in hospital until the child is born. Mum's estranged daughter Lorraine (now played by [[Gabrielle Hartley]]) eventually re-appears on the scene, and after seeing Judith's baby, offers to make amends, and asks Judith and Mum to come back home and live with her. Mum is seen one more time later in the series for yet another storyline in episodes 199\u2013204, reappearing in episode 199 when Bea \u2013 who has lost her memory in a crash while being transported back from Barnhurst \u2013 finds her once more. After another brief stint at Wentworth for aiding Bea, we are told a couple of years later in episode 388 that she has died of a heart attack, but left $20,000 to the prisoners. In episode 539, Governor Ann Reynolds persuades new prisoner Daphne Graham to tend to Mum's old rose garden to make new again that wore out after six years.\n* '''Rosie Hudson''' ([[Anne-Maree McDonald]]) \u2013 episodes 2\u201373) (seen in recap of 74), a young prisoner who is heavily pregnant at the start of the series and gives birth during the riot of episodes 3\u20134. After giving birth, the character disappears from the series (being moved to the maternity block), but reappears in episodes 70\u201373. With her baby coming up to his first birthday (once again, not tallying with real time), she is in denial that he will be taken away from her by foster parents once he turns one. As a result, she suffers a breakdown, part of which, during a security alert, she punches the pregnant Chrissie in the stomach, endangering Chrissie's baby. Rosie is not seen again after these events, being taken into psychiatric care, this causes a lot of tension between the prisoners.\n* '''Lorna Young''' ([[Barbara Jungwirth]]) \u2013 episodes 2-692), One of the longest serving background characters: she appears regularly throughout the whole run of the series. Her first speaking contribution (and in a surprisingly posh voice too) is in 120, which is the first time the name Lorna is used for her, Later credits in 215 for an argument with Doreen over TV in the rec room 219 and 250 where her only line appears to be baaing like a sheep 253 where she criticises Bea for framing Marie Winter 293 when she contributes a present to use for the frame up on Joan. She gets the springs for the \"bomb\" to embarrass Joan.\n* '''Tina Murray''' ([[Hazel Henley]])\u2013 episodes 2-692), Prisoner in Wentworth. The actress is one of the background characters throughout the whole series from, though not always with this name. she is first called Murray in 206. She usually isn't given lines, and so is only credited for episodes 593 and 607.\n* '''Christine Angela \"Chrissie\" Latham''' ([[Amanda Muggleton]] \u2013 episodes 3-338), a lascivious prostitute who spent much of her time behind bars lamenting the fact that there were no men around. She murdered Bill Jackson, Meg's husband, with a pair of scissors during the show's first riot. She returned in episode 065 after being in Barnhurst where it is discovered she became pregnant in custody. Chrissie keeps the baby to avoid a bashing from Bea and her daughter Elizabeth (named after Lizzie Birdsworth) becomes Chrissie's main focus causing her to turn over a new leaf. Whilst trying to protect or keep Elizabeth from being put into homes, Chrissie tried many stunts including running away interstate with the baby. Upon her return to Wentworth, new officer Joan 'The Freak' Ferguson begins work. It is here where Joan is often dangling the idea of visits with her daughter that causes Chrissie to reveal Bea's plans to set up the Freak. When Joan admits to Chrissie she will stand up in court and give bad character references at a custody hearing, Chrissie lashes out. During this fight we see the full extent of what the Freak is capable of and Chrissie becomes hospitalised at the hands of the Freaks first real bashing. At first, an enemy of Bea Smith, she later on became one of Bea's allies.  She was eventually transferred to Barnhurst, as Bea herself later would be.\n* '''Helen Masters''' ([[Louise Pajo]] \u2013 episodes 8\u201310), an international businesswoman who was well known in the media due to her cosmetics enterprise remanded to Wentworth for running down and killing a child in a hit and run. She had denied all involvement and was found innocent although it was revealed that she was secretly guilty and had been driving the car when heavily intoxicated. Her haughty attitude alienates both staff and prisoners. She subsequently won over many of the prisoners, including Bea, as she demanded better conditions and promised to campaign for such when she was released. However, on a television interview after she was freed, she turned on the prisoners, saying they deserved all they got, humiliating Bea.\n* '''Monica \"Monnie\" Ferguson''' ([[Lesley Baker]] \u2013 episodes 15\u201360), a brutish, hulking inmate inside for bashing her weaselly husband Fred ([[Gary Files]]). A friend of Bea Smith (though the pair often argued) after the pair had previously been cellmates in another prison, she initially acts as a sidekick to her (at which point the character was a semi-regular), but upon Bea's escape, takes over as Top Dog herself, using very heavy-handed tactics and upsetting many of the women. After Bea's recapture, Monica attempts to remain Top Dog, leading to a brief power struggle. After one scuffle with Smith, in which Meg Jackson is injured, and with her parole coming up, Monica backs down rather than risk not getting paroled. However, with her release, she agrees to recover Joyce Martain's hidden loot from a payroll heist in return for a cut, in order to pay of husband Fred's gambling debts; but Fred has exaggerated his debts in order to get money out of her and run off with his fancy girl Denise \"Blossom\" Crabtree (see separate entry). When Monica finds out, distraught after she had done so much to make a fresh go with him, she bashes him, and is sent to Wentworth once again (and the loot is recovered soon after). During her second stint in Wentworth, Monica becomes involved in a couple of minor escapades (such as exploiting Deputy Governor Jim Fletcher's [[haemophobia]] with Bea), but for the most part tries to keep out of trouble in order to get her parole. Towards the end of her sentence, with Bea in solitary, Monica finds herself at odds with criminal mastermind Toni McNally (see separate entry), whom she refuses to bow down to, while Toni and henchman Martha suspect Monie of tipping off Vera with information about Toni's smuggling booze and drugs into the prison (although just how much Monica has told Vera, if anything, is never made overly clear). Monica's parole seems doomed when she finally flips over Martha's taunts and lashes out, until Officer Jackson speaks up for her in front of Governor Davidson, saying that she believes the incident was a setup to ruin Monica's parole. Erica decides to release Monnie, who is planning to start afresh in a new State, and it is the last time the character is seen in the series.\n* '''Barbara Davidson''' ([[Sally Cahill (Australian actress)|Sally Cahill]] \u2013 episodes 17\u201324), the niece of governor Erica Davidson. Admitted to Wentworth on drug charges, a seemingly girly, innocent persona covers the fact that she is calculating and sly. She strikes up a partnership with Vera, which includes framing Monica Ferguson for possession of drugs. She is eventually transferred to Barnhurst after Doreen's bullying pushes her to dousing her cell in petrol and threatening to set light to herself, leading Erica to realise that it is unrealistic to have a close relation in Wentworth without risk of either special treatment or bullying. She is mentioned last in episode 215.\n* '''Catherine Roberts''' ([[Margo McLennan]] \u2013 episodes 18\u201324), a middle-class housewife who runs down and kills the man who raped her teenage daughter. After she is sentenced, striking a friendship with Bea in the process, the character just disappears, and it is later revealed she has been moved to another block in Episode 28. It is assumed her husband Ken sends their daughter away to stay with her aunt, though this is never revealed one way or the other as, once Catherine's character disappears, so does the story.\n* '''Phyllis Hunt''' ([[Reylene Pearce]] \u2013 episodes 21\u2013460), background prisoner who eventually takes on a larger role around the time of Bea Smith's departure from the series, turning nasty in the process. After messing up Reb's drugs scheme at the Wentworth Fete, Reb takes revenge and horribly bashes her with a wooden statue, leading her to have permanent brain damage. her boyfriend takes revenge on Ann Reynolds.\n* '''Susan Rice''' ([[Briony Behets]] \u2013 episodes 25\u201329), an emotionally fragile woman sent to Wentworth after being caught [[shoplifting]]. As Officer Jackson becomes concerned about Susan's mental state, it becomes apparent that Susan is angry at a (fictional) pop star Jason Richards for taking her husband Fredrick away from her, destroying their marriage. It ultimately transpires that Richards is actually the [[stage name]] of Fredrick, and they are one and the same. Upon release, Susan invades a TV interview with \"Richards\", throwing acid in his face, before being taken away to a secure psychiatric unit.\n* '''Martha Eaves''' ([[Kate Jason]] \u2013 episodes 29\u201364), a dimwitted, burly prisoner ridiculed by the other women, but who often acts as hired muscle for wannabe top dogs or those needing physical back-up. She is involved in two notable storylines: the first comes in episodes 50\u201352 when, after constantly being bullied and belittled by the other woman for being stupid, she tries to befriend child murder Bella Albrecht (see separate entry), who is hated by the other women for her crime. But after Martha overhears Bella saying that she too thinks Martha is stupid, Martha attacks her in the shower blocks and drowns her. When Martha returns from solitary in episode 58, she starts working for criminal mastermind Antonia McNally, who uses Martha's muscle to take over Bea's position while Bea is in solitary. Eventually, as the other women begin to become disillusioned with McNally and start to side with Bea to go up against Vera Bennett and Jim Fletcher who are running the prison when Governor Erica Davidson takes a leave, Martha wants her and Toni to join in on the act but Toni wants no part of it due to her trial. She tells Martha that she could join them in the act if she wants to which she does. Although not written out of the series in any real manner, Martha is not seen after the conclusion of the McNally storyline in episode 64. In episode 128, Noeline Burke is scaring another woman accused of \"baby bashing\", Gail Summers, by telling her that Martha killed the previous such inmate and was sent to the loony bin as a result, which seemingly conflicts with Martha's involvement in the McNally storyline. (It might be presumed that Noeline was just trying to cause trouble).\n* '''Noeline Burke''' ([[Jude Kuring]] \u2013 episodes 30\u2013132), the head of a family of petty criminals usually inside for burglary and theft. An antagonist of both Bea Smith and Monica Ferguson, Noeline was famous for her refusal to take anything she considered charity. In Noeline's words, \"The Burkes don't take charity, we just take.\" When she comes back to Wentworth she is very upset over Leanne Burke (see separate entry)'s death; she blames the officers for it and she doesn't understand that it was a tragic accident. She is later transferred to Barnhurst for her own safety. Note that Noeline's surname varies between Burke and Bourke in different sources; it is pronounced on-screen as \"Burke\".\n* '''Clara Goddard''' ([[Betty Lucas]] \u2013 episodes 30\u201339), a genteel, flighty socialite who initially planned to start a Halfway House for ex-prisoners, but ended up being remanded to Wentworth for embezzlement, where she gains considerable influence amongst the women, especially in the escaped Bea's absence. Sarcastically nicknamed \"Madame Clara\" and \"[[Tinker Bell|Tinkerbell]]\" by Bea when she returns, jealous of the way Clara manages to usurp her authority as top dog of the prisoners. During an examination of the running of the prison, the V.J. orders that Clara be moved to a dedicated remand section at Fairlea.\n* '''Kathleen Leach''' ([[Penny Stewart]]] \u2013 episodes 30\u2013149), beginning as a background prisoner (often uncredited), Kathleen went on to be involved with two notable plotlines. She is put in to share a cell with Ros Coulson in episode 80, in the middle of Ros planning to escape with terrorist Janet Dominguez. Kathleen tries to convince her not to, fearing that the terrorists will kill the officers, but Ros escapes anyway during the botched break-out. Kath is last seen during this storyline in episode 89, being questioned by the police, and presumably goes on to be released. The character returns in episode 143, seemingly arrested on a short sentence for prostitution, but has in fact been put inside as a plant by Tracey Morris' \"boyfriend\" Joe to make sure that Tracey will not testify against him. When Tracey realises that Joe has been using her, Kathleen is given orders to kill Tracey; unable to carry out the instructions, she goes to Bea for help. Bea purposely scolds Kathleen's hand in the laundry steam press (episode 147), putting Kathleen out of action and sending her off to hospital, with a valid \"excuse\" to her employers for being unable to carry out her orders. The last time she is seen is saying to Doreen that she can give her a fat lip if she sees her on the outside, due to a previous argument the two had in the recreation room earlier on.\n* '''Leanne Burke''' ([[Tracey-Jo Riley]])\u2013 episodes 33\u2013121), Noeline Burke's daughter, who has inherited her mother's criminal tendencies. She first is seen visiting Noeline with her rather slow brother Col ([[Brian Granrott]]) in episode 33, telling her about the problems they are facing without her. Leanne returns in episode 50, where her mother and she are caught trying to rob a building. Although Leanne escapes charge, Noeline is once again sent to Wentworth, and Leanne meets Welfare Officer Jean Vernon while visiting. Jean gives her the address of the apartment she shares with Meg if she needs guidance \u2013 only for Leanne to rob the place with a young man, Denny ([[Tony Mahood]]) she's met. However, Jean is determined to try to set Leanne on the straight and narrow, and convinces Meg to let Leanne move in with them while they find Leanne a steady job. Leanne constantly abuses this trust, infuriating Meg; Jean continually convinces Meg to give Leanne \"one more chance\", until eventually, in episode 55/6, Leanne and Denny are caught trying to hold up a service station. Leanne disappears from the series at this point, and it is not clear what she is charged with (she is not sent to Wentworth). The character finally arrives at Wentworth in episode 120 charged with [[petty larceny]]. Although some of the other women are sceptical of Leanne as she is Noeline's daughter, she quickly becomes good friends with Judy, and is very active with helping arrange the riot to demand that murderous officer Jock Stewart be brought to justice. However, in episode 121, when the riot takes to the prison roof, Leanne falls to her death while trying to wave a banner for the gathering media to see. Note that, like mother Noeline, Leanne's surname varies between Burke and Bourke in different sources; it is pronounced on-screen as \"Burke\".\n* '''Irene Zervos''' ([[Maria Mercedes (actor)|Maria Mercedes]] \u2013 episodes 38\u201340), a young Greek woman admitted to Wentworth after being blackmailed into prostitution by a relative who is aware of her status as an illegal immigrant. Matters are complicated further by the fact that Irene does not speak English, leaving Karen, with only a smattering of basic Greek, trying to translate for her.\n* '''Joyce Martin''' ([[Judy Nunn]] \u2013 episodes 40\u201348), the wife of an armed robber inside for being an accessory, and the only person who knows the location of the loot. After her husband forcibly tries to have her abducted from the prison grounds to force her into revealing the loot's location to him, Joyce makes a deal with Monica, who is due for release, for Monica to retrieve the stash in return for giving Monica a cut. Heavies hired by Joyce's husband try to snatch Monica, but mistakenly grab Lynn, who is released on the same day. The loot is eventually recovered when Jim Fletcher double-crosses Denise Crabtree (see below entry) to find the stashed key to unlock the loot. With the storyline having run its course, Joyce is moved to D Block in episode 48, the last time the character is seen.\n* '''Denise \"Blossom\" Crabtree''' ([[Lynda Keane]] \u2013 episodes 43\u201348), a tartly young woman who is the girlfriend of Monica Ferguson's husband Fred, but who turns out to be using him to get her hands on the stolen loot from the robbery committed by Joyce Martin's husband. When she winds up in Wentworth, Monica is angry to find that she has been having an affair with Fred; while Denise, when released, tries to seduce Jim Fletcher into helping her, after the key to the loot was stashed in the prison. However, Jim double-crosses her, and hands the loot into the police.\n* '''Edith \"Edie\" Wharton''' ([[Colleen Clifford]] \u2013 episodes 44\u201349), an elderly, kindly woman who is made homeless with her partner Horrie. Horrie dies after the pair spend the night sleeping rough, and Edith ends up charged with a minor vandalism crime (against the shelter who refused to take them in) and ends up in Wentworth charged with vagrancy. Edie's stay in the prison brings out the softer side of deputy governor Jim Fletcher, who goes out of his way to see that she is comfortable and cared for. Lizzie quickly strikes up a close friendship with her, and they enjoy talking about the old days. With a roof over her head, regular meals and with the new friends she has made, Edith does not want to leave Wentworth to go to the shabby bedsit that Jean Vernon has arranged, but dies in her sleep the night before she is due to be released, leaving Lizzie contemplating the prospect of dying in prison herself. With no relations or estate to pay for Edie's funeral, Jim Fletcher quietly steps in to pay for the funeral himself, out of the reward for recovering Joyce Martin's stolen loot.\n* '''Melinda Cross''' ([[Lulu Pinkus]] \u2013 episodes 47\u201358), a devious young woman, who is a student at the same university as Karen. She tries to blackmail Tom ([[Hu Pryce]]), her lecturer with whom she has been having an affair, with intimate pictures of her with him, demanding money else she will show the pictures to Tom's wife. When Tom's wife does find out, she informs the Police, and after being caught in the act receiving a pay-off, Melinda arrested and sent to Wentworth awaiting trial. She is pregnant with Tom's child, and after a brief spell in Wentworth, escapes conviction by convincing the Judge that she was only acting out of desperation of wanting the father of her baby. However, once released, she tells Greg (who has just opened up his own practice after leaving his job at the prison) that the story was just a convenient excuse, and that she plans to have an [[abortion]], putting Greg in an awkward position as it means that Melinda committed [[perjury]]. The newly released Karen very briefly moves in with Melinda, but after Melinda goes elsewhere to have an abortion after Greg refuses to help, and does it under Karen's name, Karen leaves to live elsewhere; this is the last time Melinda is seen in the series.\n* '''Bella Swan Albrecht''' ([[Liddy Clark]] \u2013 episodes 51\u201352), a remorseless child killer who had murdered her toddler daughter \u2013 which she saw as getting in the way of her securing a relationship \u2013 and arrives at Wentworth on remand. The officers attempt to keep her crime under wraps, knowing it will anger the other women, who despise those who harm children, but word soon leaks out after Bea dupes visiting psychologist Peter Clements into revealing why she is really in Wentworth. Although Bella tries to strike up a friendship with Karen, her only real 'friend' comes in Martha Eaves, feeling lonely after bullying by the other woman. Bella winds up attacked in the shower block and drowned in a wash basin; Martha is later found out to be the culprit. She's later mentioned in episode 277 by Lizzie when the women feel that a new prisoner who have arrived and placed in solitary that they aren't being told about or allowed to see due to possibly being dangerous. Lizzie then refers to the prisoner possibly doing something similar to Bella's crime of killing children due to her possibly doing something big they're not being led on about.\n* '''Antonia \"Toni\" McNally''' ([[Pat Bishop]] \u2013 episodes 57\u201364), a cool, classy woman on remand for the murder of the woman who was having an affair with her husband, and who tries to buy the women's favour and take over as top dog while Bea Smith is away in solitary confinement. Antonia is the wife of the head of the local underworld with friends in high places \u2013 amongst other things, she pulls strings to have Jim Fletcher given leave to get him off her back \u2013 and pressure is brought to bear on governor Erica Davidson to give her special privileges that further cements Toni's high status amongst the prisoners. Toni also starts smuggling in [[contraband]], including booze and drugs, and hires Martha Eaves as her muscle and lackey. When Bea is released from solitary, the two briefly strike up an uneasy alliance, until Bea learns that Toni has been smuggling in drugs, at which point the two become involved in a power struggle. By this point, though, Governor Davidson takes a temporary leave and the other women begin to side with Bea to go up against Vera Bennett and Jim Fletcher who are now in charge of the prison. Toni however refuses to take part in this. Shortly after, Antonia is sent for trial, but is let off Scot free after thugs hired by her intimidate the only witness into giving a false statement. Walking free from court, she is shot by Ros Coulson, the daughter the woman Toni killed, and dies soon after.\n* '''Roslyn Louise \"Ros\" Coulson''' ([[Sigrid Thornton]] \u2013 episodes 63\u201392), an idealistic young woman, in her last year at convent school, who first appears in episode 63 claiming to be a relation of Antonia McNally. However, Ros is actually the daughter of the woman McNally murdered. When McNally gets off Scot free, Ros fatally shoots her, seeing it as justified. Once sentenced, the gentle Ros's attitude quickly changes, as she believes she has done nothing wrong. She orchestrates an escape, arranging a distraction, allowing her to stow away in a visiting van. She seeks refuge at the newly opened halfway house, but \u2013 despite Doreen's pleas \u2013 Karen turns her away, telling her that if they were found harbouring a fugitive, it would destroy the whole project. Ros tries the [[brothel]] where her late mother worked, but when an associate of McNally's tries to force her into prostitution, she flees, and is captured soon after. Back in Wentworth, she is won over by terrorist Janet Dominquez, who plans to escape and offers to take Ros with her in return for Ros's help. But the terrorist break-out doesn't go as planned; Ros saves Governor Davidson from being fatally shot, and escapes on her own; following a tip-off from Chrissie, she is re-captured a while later. After this, Ros, with encouragement from Erica, begins to see that her attitude will not get her anywhere, and under the guidance of welfare officer Paul Reid, begins studying. To aid her in this, Erica has her moved to a quieter block with some other studying prisoners, in episode 92 \u2013 the last time the character is seen. When Doreen gets married at the prison in episode 116, she mentions asking permission for Ros to be a guest, but the character does not appear. In episode 158, while giving a pep talk to Doreen, Erica mentions that Ros got her qualification. She is lastly mentioned in episode 176 when prisoner Evelyn Randall offers Lizzie some of her homemade tea that helps a person sleep easily; to which Lizzie tells her how she wishes that can put the prison staff to sleep for a while like how Roslyn did in episode 81 with some drugs in an attempt to escape from Wentworth with terrorist Janet Dominguez (see below) that unfortunately went unsuccessful.\n* '''Patricia Mary Theresa \"Pat\" O'Connell''' ([[Monica Maughan]] \u2013 episodes 65\u2013110), a level headed, kind hearted middle-aged mother who is transferred from Barnhurst along with Chrissie Latham in episode 65. She is inside for aiding and abetting her criminal husband in an armed robbery (although, confusingly, on the character's first mention before her transfer, in episode 60, we hear that she is charged for driving a car through a shop window that had repossessed her furniture, something that is never mentioned again). Pat is being forced to go through with a divorce from her husband in order to give her a better chance of keeping her children, and is determined to keep out of trouble so that she might get her parole by Christmas and be reunited with her son and daughter, who are staying with her elderly mother who is finding it hard to cope with them. Despite jeopardising her parole by meeting with her eldest son David, who is also in prison and visiting Wentworth on a work party, Pat is paroled and reunited with her youngest children in time for Christmas. However, around this time David escapes from prison, which leads to a police shoot-out when he tries to visit her, resulting in Pat being returned to Wentworth when the police are convinced she was in cohorts with David, and leaving David jaded at Dr. Greg Miller, whom he is certain tipped the police off, prompting him to try to shoot Greg but getting Karen in error. Unable to cope in prison, David kills himself soon after. Pat's kind nature comes through when she insists that Bea not attack the pregnant Chrissie, and with both Doreen and Lizzie on release, she becomes Bea's main sidekick for a spell. Pat is eventually released when her sentence is reduced on appeal and she is given parole; she is last seen when Paul Reid drives her home with her kids.\n* '''Janet Rose Dominguez''' ([[Deidre Rubenstein]] \u2013 episodes 79\u201383), a terrorist brought to Wentworth awaiting extradition to the US to face charges in connection with the bombing of a South American official outside the UN building. She is held in solitary away from the other women, as the officers do not want her interacting with or influencing the other women, but she wins over Ros Coulson, who is being held in the adjoining solitary cell. Ros helps aid an escape and is given an instant sleep powder to drug the guards while armed terrorists brake into the prison to free Janet. However, the break-out does not go according to plan, and Dominguez is shot and wounded trying to escape. She is taken away from Wentworth on a stretcher soon after, accompanied by federal Police. She's mentioned in episode 277 by Lizzie after the women are surprised a letter they written and sent to be published in a newspaper wasn't published in it. This led to Lizzie believing that terrorist could have been responsible behind it and refers to Janet.\n* '''Caroline Margaret Simpson''' ([[Rosalind Speirs]] \u2013 episodes 89\u2013114), arrives at the Halfway House with her fragile mother Vivienne (see below entry), who is seeking shelter from her abusive husband but is turned away. Soon after, when her father's violent temper boils over and he threatens to kill her mother with a shotgun, Caroline fatally stabs him. Caroline convinces Vivienne that they must say intruders killed him, but their story is soon exposed and they end up in Wentworth awaiting trial. Once inside, Officer Jim Fletcher shows an interest in Caroline, subtlety at first, but it is soon noticed by the other women (reinforcing his nickname \"Fletch the Letch\"), although Caroline does not return his advances. Caroline's estranged, possessive ex-husband Michael ([[Peter Ford (actor)|Peter Ford]]) offers to pay bail, but she refuses to bow down to his terms; while Michael becomes jaded at Jim, whom he sees as coming between Caroline and himself. Although Jim also offers to pay bail, Caroline refuses, not wanting to be in his debt, but when Vivienne's frail state of health worsens, Caroline finally agrees. Eventually Jim bails Caroline too; when she moves into the Halfway House, she continues seeing him and she finally returns his advances, and the pair begin a romantic relationship, even though Jim is breaking the terms of Caroline's bail. When Michael and Geoff Butler ([[Ray Meagher]]) (who is bitter at Jim for turning him in to the police over a previous incident) join forces, Butler dupes Michael \u2013 who insists that he wants no-one badly hurt \u2013 into delivering a bomb to Jim's motel room, it kills Jim's wife and children. This puts a severe strain on Caroline and Jim's relationship, with him telling her after the explosion that he blames her. But when Vivienne and Caroline finally go to trial, and are released on good behaviour bonds, she visits him one last time and they part on reasonable terms. This parting scene with Jim, before she goes to stay with Michael's sister, is Caroline's last appearance in the series. Note: Although billed as Caroline, many characters, including her own mother, pronounced her name as ''Carolyn''.\n* '''Vivienne Anne Williams''' ([[Bernadette Gibson]] episodes 89\u2013114), the mother of Caroline (see above entry), who is suffering at the hands of her abusive husband. After Caroline kills him in self-defence, the pair arrive at Wentworth, where Vivienne's fragile health worsens. Eventually, it is Lizzie (who at the time is on release and visits to see Bea) who recognises Vivienne and Caroline from seeking shelter at the Halfway House, adding some support to their claims of abuse, and Vivienne is released awaiting trial. However, once home, the strain of events is too much for Vivienne and she tries to commit [[suicide]], after which she is put into a care home, not seen for a few episodes. Eventually, in episode 114, Vivienne and Caroline come up for trial, and their charges are reduced to [[manslaughter]], allowing them to be freed on good behaviour bonds.\n* '''Sharon Gilmour''' ([[Margot Knight]] \u2013 episodes 90\u2013116), a scheming, spoiled young woman who is imprisoned for drug dealing after a Police raid where she was selling dope to a group of youths (including Social Worker Paul Reid's son Tony ([[John Higginson]])). Being a drug dealer, not to mention a vindictive trouble-stirrer, Sharon immediately becomes an enemy of Bea. Despite having a lover, Judy Bryant (see separate entry), on the outside, Sharon becomes involved in a romantic relationship with Chrissie Latham, and the pair work together for a time to become Top Dog(s) while Bea is in isolation. Jealous of this romantic relationship, Judy purposely gets herself arrested so she can be inside with Sharon, but Sharon uses her spiteful ways to manipulate Judy as she does with everyone else. With Chrissie moved to maternity to be with her baby, Sharon later starts vicious rumours that Kerry Vincent (see separate entry) is a \"lagger\" (informant) after Kerry turns down her romantic advances. Judy finally becomes tired of Sharon's scheming, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] ways and puts an end to their relationship. When Sharon witnesses corrupt officer Jock Stewart ([[Tommy Dysart]]) blackmailing and physically attacking Doreen, she tries to strike up working deal with him \u2013 she'll keep quiet about what she has seen in return for him protecting her. But soon after, she is found at the bottom of a flight of stairs with her neck broken. Judy, Bea and Kerry are all suspects, but it was Jock who murdered her.\n* '''Judith Francis \"Judy\" Bryant''' ([[Betty Bobbitt]] \u2013 episodes 91-534), an American ex-pat lesbian who deliberately committed a crime to join her lover Sharon Gilmour in prison. She was initially an agitator, but later became one of Bea's allies, as well as a long-term inmate.  Judy ran Driscoll House, a Half-Way House for ex-criminals to get back on their feet.  Judy was sent back to Wentworth after helping friend, Hazel Kent, kill herself while she was suffering from a terminal brain tumour. Served as a sort of \"deputy Top Dog,\" to both Bea and Myra. She was later released to become a successful songwriter.\n* '''Lilian \"Lil\" Stokes''' ([[Judith McLorinan]] \u2013 episodes 91\u2013392), The smaller one of Margo Gaffney's goons. Most of her appearances come without a speaking part. she is first seen in episode 91 briefly in the background with Margo Gaffney's bigger goon: Bev Covelli. Lil has her first big scene when she helps Margo and Bev give Sharon a \"haircut\". In her last appearance she dies when the prison is under quarantine, in deputy governor Colleen Powell's arms.\n* '''Margo Jane Gaffney''' ([[Jane Clifton]] \u2013 episodes 92\u2013448), one of a long line of agitators in the prison cell block who generally played rival to the reigning top-dog. Margo took charge of all gambling inside Wentworth and was usually accompanied by her stooges \"Lil and Bev\" (played by extras Judith McLorinan and Kaye Chadwick). Margo went back and forth during the series run from a good to bad guy, usually leaning toward the bad side.  One of Margo's most heinous acts was the bashing of guard Meg Morris, who was temporarily a prisoner for contempt of court, and this earned her the combined wrath of Bea and Chrissie (who ironically saved Meg, despite her killing Meg's first husband, Bill Jackson), and avenged her bashing, by tying her up and tarring and feathering her in the lavatory.  Margo was also later bashed by Bea and Chrissie when it was discovered that she set the storeroom on fire with a [[Molotov cocktail]] at Wentworth, thus beginning the Great Fire at Wentworth, and lied about it to the cops. She later tries to frame Reb for attacking Myra Desmond but is found out and transferred to Blackmoore.

The character \u2013 with no dialogue \u2013 is first referred to as \"Mouse\" in episode 100.\n* '''Kerry Vincent''' ([[Penny Downie]] \u2013 episodes 112\u2013124), a young prisoner transferred to Wentworth to give her room to let her artistic talent flourish. Some of the women are sceptical of the special treatment that Kerry is given, such as being given a double cell to herself to give her room to do her paintings. Bea in particular does not take to her after she finds that Kerry's transfer was arranged by Ken Pearce ([[Tom Oliver]]), whom Bea has developed a crush on. As we learn more about Kerry, we hear that she is a former prostitute who is inside after violently attacking a client. Kerry's agent is David Austin ([[Rod Mullinar]]), a smarmy art dealer who is exploiting Kerry's status as a prisoner to drum up publicity and sell her work for huge profit. Kerry tries to get on with the other women, but they turn on her when malicious Sharon Gilmour starts spreading rumours of her being a \"lagger\" (informant) after Kerry turned down her romantic advances. During this period, Kerry also gives Vera a painting that she intends to destroy, only for Austin to concoct a story of Vera bribing it out of Kerry, in order to give him more publicity, nearly costing Vera her job until Jock Stewart helps her set things straight with Austin; as a result, Austin is banned from visiting her at Wentworth. Kerry is given parole in episode 117 and set up in a small studio flat, but only on the proviso that she does not see Austin, but Kerry is oblivious to his manipulating her and continues seeing him, and becomes jealous of other women he is seeing. This leads her to several drunken benders, the last of which results in her smashing David over the head with an ashtray, causing her to think she has killed him. She plans to flee the area; Helen Smart (see separate entry)'s [[pimp]] sells her some drugs to calm her down, but she takes them with alcohol, nearly killing her. When David finds her in this state, instead of calling for medical aid, he takes her paintings instead. Helen discovers Kerry and alerts Parole Officer Paul Reid just in time; after she is out of danger, he arranges that her parole not be cancelled if she agrees to be treated in a [[sanatorium]]. Kerry agrees to this, and it is the last time she is seen in the series.\n* '''Helen Pamela Smart''' ([[Caroline Gillmer]] \u2013 episodes 118\u2013441), a likeable, amusing prostitute frequently sent to Wentworth for soliciting who becomes a useful contact for the women on the outside.

She is sent to Wentworth on remand, where she instantly faces the anger of the other women when they find what she is in for, branding her a \"baby basher\". Eventually, a talk from Captain Barton (standing in for the departed Paul Reid) convinces her to stand up for herself; she gives an emotional speech to the other women telling them how she simply could not cope but loves her children, after which the women ease up on her. Gail goes to trial and is given a suspended sentence, on condition that she seek help. She moves away to join a support group.\n* '''Kay Frances White''' ([[Sandy Gore]] \u2013 episodes 127\u2013145), the sly administrator of Andrew Reynolds's clothing factory, where a work scheme has been arranged with Wentworth for some of the prisoners. Kay places several large bets with bookie Margo (and holds out on paying up the money she owes), and agreeing to help Judy make a dress for an escape attempt. With suspicion on her for a series of thefts from the factory, she sets up Noeline to take the blame, to try to get Mr. Reynolds off of her back. Soon after, her long-running embezzlement of company funds, to fund her compulsive gambling habit, is uncovered when she \"borrows\" payroll money to place a large bet, in hope of making back the money she has taken from the company, but she is caught in the act, and sent to Wentworth awaiting trial. There, she tries to use her gambling addiction as a claim that she needs psychiatric help in order to escape charge, but having got on the wrong side of the women over the cancellation of the work programme, and her generally manipulative attitude, Bea orchestrates a scheme to expose that Kay is still willingly gambling; the plot is successful, and Kay does not escape charge, returning to Wentworth as an inmate with a five-year sentence. But from this point, Kay's manner only get more extreme \u2013 she opens her own book to overtake Margo's, and using very heavy-handed methods to secure bets. This leads to Bea being sent to solitary after giving Kay a \"bashing\", and in Bea's absence, Kay makes a move to be Top Dog. Judy, with help from Lizzie and others, plan to put Kay's racket out of action by placing large bets that she can't possibly afford to cover. After this backfires, they record a dog race from the radio on Tracey Morris's tape recorder, place a huge bet with Kay (knowing the outcome) and doctor the newspaper's racing page accordingly, and play the tape back next day as if it were live. The scheme works, but when Kay \"borrows\" Tracey's tape recorder and realises she's been set up, she goes frantic and violently attacks Lizzie in her cell, nearly strangling her until Linda Jones smashes Kay over the head with a kettle jug to save Lizzie, leaving Kay unconscious and covered in blood. She later dies from a blood clot on the brain. Lizzie stows Linda away from the scene and insist that she herself must take the blame (for more on this, see Linda Jones's profile, below).\n* '''Linda Mary Jones''' ([[Elaine Cusick]]) \u2013 episodes 140\u2013150), first introduced as an existing prisoner who is working as a runner for Margo's betting racket, Linda also has concerns when her son Danny ([[Darren Sole]]) is unhappy living with her overbearing, bullying sister while she is inside and runs away.

Meanwhile, Kay White, starting her own more heavy-handed bookie racket, forces Linda into acting as runner for her, something that Linda reluctantly does. When the women try to put Kay out of action with a gambling con, Kay flips out at Lizzie and tries to strangle her in her cell; Linda arrives and smashes Kay over the head with a kettle jug, leaving Kay unconscious. Lizzie manages to stow Linda away before any officers arrive on the scene, and insists that she take the wrap for it instead, both in return for Linda saving her life, and concerned about her being reunited with Danny. Linda insists she tell Erica what really happened, but Lizzie insists she keep quiet. Kay later dies, but Lizzie convinces the V.J. that she was behind Kay's injuries, allowing Linda to get her parole and be reunited with Danny, leaving to live in the new apartment that Danny and Jim have organised. However, a few episodes after Linda's departure, a jaded Doreen goes to Mrs. Davidson and tries to tell her the real circumstances of Kay's death. Erica sends Jim Fletcher to visit Linda and question her, but she convinces him that Lizzie's version is correct.

After Sarah and Jim spend the night together, Sarah finds Jim's Prison Officer jacket and flees, and when he visits her at the interior design business, she is very cold towards him and tells him that the relationship is over. At the same time, Erica is thinking of having some home decorating done, and Meg mentions that she has heard Jim has an interior design friend. Although Jim tries to put her off, Erica visits Sarah's business and seems to recognise her. Soon after, she realises that she is actually Jacki Nolan, who escaped from Barnhurst a few years previously, and is now using Sarah Forrest as an alias. Erica convinces Jim to try to persuade Jacki to turn herself in; Jim is unsure what to do and stalls, but Jacki turns herself in on her own accord. Sent to Wentworth, Sarah and Jim try to play down their relationship to both Erica and the other inmates. Jim joins Erica at a Prisoners Reform Group meeting, where the group comes up with a high-profile publicity campaign to get Jacki pardoned \u2013 insisting that she has self-rehabilitated and that her successful business proves this \u2013 amongst other propaganda. But Julia has his own campaign to get Jacki pardoned, and warns Jim to keep away else it will ruin the whole petition. Jacki faces going back to Barnhurst, but she is loath to as she was molested by a bullying lesbian officer (who some fans have theorised may have been Joan Ferguson) during her previous sentence, hence her escape in the first place. With increasing media attention over the case, Jacki is just about to be transferred to Barnhurst when her pardon comes through. She leaves Wentworth, presumably to resume running the business with Julian, and never to see Jim again.\n* '''Myra June Desmond''' ([[Anne Phelan]] \u2013 episodes 154\u2013552), a former prisoner who had worked with the Prison Reform Group before arriving back at Wentworth and replacing Bea Smith as the show's second long-running \"top dog\". She was a thoughtful but strong woman who gave up her own life for the safety of the other hostages during The Ballanger Siege. Before the siege, Desmond organised a scheme to set up Joan Ferguson by bashing Lou Kelly and then framing Joan for the assault. The scheme worked until inmate Anita Selby revealed the truth to then-Governor Ann Reynolds. Reynolds then reinstated Ferguson and introduced a stricter security regime at the prison. She later confronted Desmond and told her that she would no longer recognise her as top dog. She also threatened Desmond with a transfer to Blackmoor if she caused any more trouble.\n* '''Anne Griffin''' ([[Rowena Wallace]] \u2013 episodes 160\u2013167), a seemingly meek, timid young woman sent to Wentworth for robbing a shopkeeper and knife-point. She insists that she is innocent, and the money found on her when she was arrested was loaned to her by her friend Megan; however, no trace (or even proof of existence) can be found of Megan and so with no alibi, Anne is to await trial. Soon after Anne's arrival, Bea is attacked from behind in the corridor, and it eventually emerges that Anne was responsible (not liking Bea's authority over the other inmates); Bea plans her revenge but Judy persuades her to hold off, convincing her that Anne is mentally unwell. Anne tries to convince the authorities that Megan has written to her, giving her the alibi she needs, but it turns out that Anne wrote the letter herself. As Erica realises that Anne needs psychiatric help, various details come to light about Anne's abusive upbringing, her imaginary friend Megan, and the baby she later had that died, also called Megan, which has left Anne in a very confused state. Anne is inside during the big tunnel escape plan of the end of the 1980 season; after the other woman realise Anne is unreliable, they try to cover up all proof of the escape plans, telling her it was merely a prank, in fear that she might inform the officers. Things come to a head during the escape attempt (165); Judy, Mouse, Doreen and another inmate; Irene Nagel, make their escape, but Lizzie decides at the last minute to join Doreen, leading both her down into the tunnels, and Bea after her trying to call her back. As the tunnels collapse, trapping Bea, Lizzie and the injured Doreen, Anne deliberately covers the cover to the tunnel (with a \"grave\" for Megan) to stop them from getting out, leaving them trapped in the collapsed tunnel for several days. Eventually Mouse is recaptured, and raises the alarm, leading the officers to rescue Bea and co. Bea plans to kill Anne for what she did, but Dr. Weisman by this time certifies her to be mentally unbalanced, and she is led away to a psychiatric hospital before Bea can exact her revenge.\n* '''Irene Nagel''' (Heather Howard - episode 165), An inmate who joins in on the escape from Wentworth at the last minute. She was mentioned by Judy as being in on the escape in episode 163, though her name was mentioned way before in episode 126 as one of the first of the women to attend the Reynolds clothing factory job. She didn't speak any lines and just followed the escape instructions with the other escapees. She was the one who inadvertently caused the tunnel collapsed by slipping and grabbing hold of an old rickety support beam that couldn't hold her weight. The tunnel collapsed, killing her. It's implied that her body was dug out and in episode 167, Erika Davidson was on the phone to inform one of her relatives of her death.\n* '''Sandra \"Sandy\" Hamilton''' ([[Candy Raymond]] \u2013 episodes 173\u2013180), a new prisoner who arrives claiming to be inside for the first time after being caught driving with expired tax. However, Bea and others soon become suspicious as, for a supposed first timer, Sandra seems very familiar with prisoner etiquette, and asks a lot of questions, particularly around and concerning Judy. They suspect her to be an undercover Police officer after information about Judy's recent escape and recapture, heightened even more when she convinces the Governor to move her into Judy's cell, and she even tries making seductive advances towards Judy; but after Bea and Judy put the heavy on her, she confesses that she is actually a newspaper [[journalist]] who deliberately got herself put inside to try to get the [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] on Judy's escape. When Evelyn Randall (see below profile) arrives in episode 175, Sandra offers to write an article about how Evelyn has been unjustly imprisoned in return for Evelyn getting information with her; when Bea and the women plant Evelyn's stolen file in Sandra's cell, Sandra is sent to isolation. When the prison is struck by an unidentified disease (episodes 177\u2013179), and the isolation cells needed to bed [[quarantine]]d officers, Sandra is returned to the women, where she becomes very scared of becoming infected, after seeing her mother waste away some years earlier, and even tries to escape during a food pick-up, leaving Jim Fletcher threatening to shoot her if she does not return, for fear of her infecting people outside the prison. With the mysterious disease \"cured\" in episode 179, Sandra finds herself framed for scarring Evelyn in a fire [[booby trap]] under Evelyn's bed, which will stop any chances of her imminent release; Sandra strikes up a deal with Bea, for Bea to prove she was innocent, in return for Sandra writing an expos\u00e9 on poor prison conditions when she is released. However, after she is released in 180, she instead writes a story written around her and her time inside, neglecting to mention the conditions she promised to expose.\n* '''Evelyn Randall''' ([[Julia Blake]] \u2013 episodes 175\u2013179; seen in recap of 180), referred to as 'Evie' only by Lizzie, she is an eccentric, middle-aged [[herbalist]] who arrives with other new prisoners Jenny Armstrong and Georgie Baxter (see separate profiles). She has been accused of manslaughter after poisoning one of her patients, but insists that she is innocent, and has a grudge against conventional medicine, insisting that everyone should see that herbal remedies are the true cure. Her haughty attitude soon gets Bea's back up, but most of the other prisoners take a liking her, annoying Bea even more. When an under-the-weather Doreen asks Evelyn for a remedy, she falls ill, leading Bea to believe that Evelyn has poisoned her; but Evelyn finds that Doreen has mistakenly heated the remedy first, which has resulted in Doreen falling sick. Soon after, a mysterious bug breaks out in the prison; it is assumed to be a tropical disease brought in by Jenny Armstrong, who had just returned from overseas. As many prisoners and officers fall dangerously ill and Wentworth is quarantined, Evelyn insists that her herbal remedies could find a cure, as conventional doctors struggle to find the cause. The other prisoners even start to believe her, when one of her secretly brewed remedies begins to heal the very ill Meg; but it eventually emerges that Evelyn was behind the \"disease\", lacing people's food with enough special ingredients to cause them to fall sick, giving her the opportunity to \"heal them\" and prove herself. When the other women find out, Bea insists that they do not take action straight away, instead biding their time and making Evie nervous. But a booby trap fire using [[Turpentine|turps]] placed under Evelyn's bed badly scalds her, seeing her led away to hospital in episode 179. She is not seen after this because Erica organised a transfer to Barnhurst for the day after, and although Bea was aware that the booby trap was placed, it was only designed that it would scare her. It is never fully revealed how Evie came to be so badly scalded, although is suggested that Bea did not authorise the incident.\n* '''Jennie Armstrong''' ([[Sally Cooper]] \u2013 episode 175), a young, naive prisoner brought to Wentworth at the same time as Georgie Baxter and Evie Randall, and emerges from the prison truck covered in blood and terrified after being attacked by Georgie.

Lizzie scares her about prison life, leading Jennie to quickly decide to pay the fine and get out. However, very soon after, prisoners and staff being to fall dangerously ill; it is suspected that Jennie might have been the cause, as she has just returned from [[Africa]] and might have brought a rare disease back with her.

Prison teacher David Andrews ([[Serge Lazareff]]) convinces Governor Davidson to let him see Georgie to try to get to the root of her behaviour, and suggests putting Georgie in with Judy, who can more than take care of herself, and Judy becomes Georgie's first real friend inside. During the mysterious \"plague\" that sweeps through the prison (176\u2013178), Georgie stays at Judy's bedside and tends to her, but, once the mystery disease has passed, Judy misinterprets Georgie's caring friendship and makes a pass at her, sending Georgie into a rage and seeing her sent to another stint in solitary (despite Judy's trying to explain to the Governor that it was her own mistake). Visiting Georgie in solitary once again, David realises that Georgie suffers from a severe hearing impediment, which has led her to misunderstand many things through life and believe people are laughing at her. Georgie soon undergoes an operation and her hearing remarkably improves. Once back at Wentworth, David suggests putting Georgie in with Bea (and Lizzie), which angers Doreen for being turfed out of her old cell, igniting a never-ending feud between the pair. Bea soon takes Georgie under her wing, but when Doreen is sent to solitary for a fight that Georgie instigated, Judy and Bea clash after Bea let Doreen take the blame. This leads to a big split between Judy and Bea, with various prisoners taking each side, and which Georgie, still furious at Judy's advances, works in the middle of to deliberately inflame even further. During this time, Georgie's mother Jeannie (see separate profile) also arrives at the prison for running a brothel, but Georgie wants nothing to do with her; while in David's classes, he begins teaching the illiterate Georgie how to read. By this time, Georgie's chance for parole is coming up, but David puts in a recommendation that she not yet be realised so that he can ensure she continues with her education. When the women discover this from Vera, they boycott David's classes, but a positive word to the V.J. from Meg, who has found Georgie a job, as well as David backing down his request so long as it is ensured Georgie continues her education outside, sees Georgie get her parole.
