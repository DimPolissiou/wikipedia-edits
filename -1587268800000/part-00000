Afterwards, the [[Ute people|Utes]] were known to live around Del Norte and the rest of the San Luis Valley going back hundreds and hundreds of years prior to Euro-American contact.  They lived here temporarily in the warmer months because of the abundance of wild game, plants, water, and timber in the area - winters were often too cold and harsh for them to settle permanently.  Spanish and Mexican peoples were the first non-natives to explore the nearby land, coming from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and other parts of New Mexico.  They were interested in surveying the 'Rio del Norte' or 'River of the North', hence the origin of the town's name.  This was the original name of the Rio Grande headwaters prior to numerous name changes over the years.  Under Mexican jurisdiction, Hispanic families began moving into the area during the early to mid-19th century as part of land grants to help the Mexican government fill and occupy the territory.  However, large-scale settlements were difficult to establish because the Utes were weary and very hostile towards Euro-American settlement, and would chase off many people who attempted to do so.  The most successful early settlement nearby was called 'La Loma', established a few miles east of where the current town site is today.  This area was chosen because there was a particular section of the Rio Grande here where it could be crossed safely and easily - one of few known for miles during this time.  After the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]] was signed in 1848, jurisdiction of the land in and around Del Norte transferred from Mexico to the United States, but settlement by Americans in the area was delayed by civil strife (including the [[American Civil War]]) throughout the 1850s and 1860s.  Most American settlements began in the area around the early 1870s by prospectors who were searching the nearby mountains for minerals such as gold and silver, particularly near an eventual boom-town named Summitville, located at the base of South Mountain near Bennett Peak.  These peaks in the [[San Juan Mountains]] were some of the last parts of Colorado where miners were allowed to explore and prospect for minerals, and they were finally able to do so after the Brunot Treaty was signed between the U.S. government and the Utes in 1873.  Once the mines proved profitable, Del Norte was officially established around 1874 in order to serve as a base camp for the mines not just in Summitville, but also in nearby [[Creede, Colorado|Creede]] and [[Lake City, Colorado|Lake City]].  Miners quickly moved into the area, and they were followed by ranchers and farmers.  Many of these original farming and ranching families still have operations and live in the Del Norte area to this day.  After the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, mining operations quickly became unprofitable and ceased.  The 'glory days' of Del Norte ended as quickly as they began, but the community still survived because of ranching and agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mt. Lookout: Where You Can See for Two Days|last=Colville|first=Ruth Marie|publisher=Benson Enterprises|year=1995|isbn=|location=Del Norte, CO|pages=|asin=B0043FGL1K}}</ref>  There was a small movement across southern Colorado throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s to secede from the State of Colorado and create the state of San Juan, with Del Norte becoming its capital city, however this secession movement died quickly.  Del Norte would see cycles of boom and bust throughout the 20th century, but has recently become a blossoming community due to the abundance of recreational activities provided by the area's unique geography; such as mountain biking, hiking, running, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, rafting and kayaking, cross country skiing, camping, etc.  Del Norte is also one of the communities which provides lodging for nearby [[Wolf Creek ski area|Wolf Creek Ski Area]].  Grande Avenue, the main street through Del Norte, still has many of the facades on its store fronts from the 1800s and early 1900s, reminding its residents and tourists of the town's historic past.  In 2019, the [[Rio Grande National Forest]] announced that it will be moving its headquarters from nearby [[Monte Vista, Colorado|Monte Vista]] to Del Norte, and the town announced that it will be improving its riverwalk to include a [[Rafting|white-water park]] along the Rio Grande.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:DelNortePeakInRioGrandeNationalForestColoradoNovember2011.JPG|thumb|left|Del Norte Peak rises above the town several miles to the west.]]\nDel Norte's absolute location is at {{coord|37|40|44|N|106|21|11|W|type:city}} (37.679015, -106.352976).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  Relatively-speaking, it is located where the [[Rio Grande]] leaves the San Juan Mountains and enters the [[San Luis Valley]], near its confluences with Pinos Creek and San Francisco Creek, respectively.  Due to its location on the western edge of the valley, a variety of climates, vegetation regions, and ecosystems transition into each other at or around Del Norte.  Within a twenty mile radius of the town, you can experience anything from alpine tundra, montane forests, to high-altitude desert.  Common vegetation around Del Norte ranges from coniferous pine trees, deciduous aspen trees and cottonwoods, to chico brush and cacti. During the warmer months of the year, [[Alcea|hollyhock]], [[Cosmos (flower)|cosmos]], [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]], and [[Helianthus|sunflowers]] are frequently found around the town.  Lookout Mountain (also known to locals as 'D' Mountain) overlooks the town, and is perhaps its most notable landmark.  The classification of 'mountain' has been a misnomer considering that 'D' Mountain has a mild [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] from the rest of the town (approximately 591 feet), and that there is nearby terrain with much greater prominence, however the classification has stuck since early settlement.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n[[File:DN Pronghorn 010520.jpg|thumb|Winter time on the Pronghorn Trail just south of Del Norte, looking east towards 'D' Mountain, the [[Sangre de Cristo Range|Sangres]], and the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Sand Dunes]].]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 729\n|1890= 736\n|1900= 705\n|1910= 840\n|1920= 1007\n|1930= 1410\n|1940= 1923\n|1950= 2048\n|1960= 1856\n|1970= 1569\n|1980= 1709\n|1990= 1674\n|2000= 1705\n|2010= 1686\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1563\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 11, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 1,705 people, 657 households, and 446 families residing in the town.  The [[population density]] was 2,004.4 people per square mile (774.5/km\u00b2).  There were 736 housing units at an average density of 865.2 per square mile (334.3/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the town was 66.86% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.12% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.06% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.41% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 27.68% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.87% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 57.36% of the population.\n\nThere were 657 households out of which 35.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.9% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.1% were non-families. 29.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.19.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 30.2% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 24.8% from 25 to 44, 22.9% from 45 to 64, and 12.8% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.7 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $23,833, and the median income for a family was $29,471. Males had a median income of $26,161 versus $21,406 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $12,751.  About 22.1% of families and 25.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 36.5% of those under age 18 and 14.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Climate==\n\nLike most places in the San Luis Valley, Del Norte is generally categorized in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] or [[Desert climate|desert]] climate.  Precipitation is the main factor that determines this classification, as it can fluctuate drastically from as many as 10-12 inches annually in a wetter year, to 2-3 inches or less during a drought year.  One reason precipitation varies greatly year to year is because the town is located in a [[rain shadow]] created by the [[San Juan Mountains]].  Because of this, precipitation is often determined by how strong and intense storm fronts are, and how these fronts move across the area.  This explains why Wolf Creek Ski Area, located about 28 miles west of town, receives on average over 400 inches of snow per year, while Del Norte receives about 10% of that amount - about 40 inches of snow annually.  Most precipitation falls in the form of rain or snow, hail and sleet are uncommon but not unheard of.  Generally, you can expect mild summers and cold winters, with spring and autumn varying between these.  Spring time in the area generally includes gusty winds, and many of the year's strongest snowstorms actually happen during this season.  Summer monsoons can hit the area as well, beginning late-July or early-August that last through the end of September.  During summer monsoons, the area generally experiences sunny mornings with clouds and storms moving in during the afternoon, and varying amounts of precipitation ranging from light drizzles of rain to brief, torrential downpours.  Like most of Colorado, night time temperatures can drop quickly and intensely due to the dry climate and the lack of moisture in the air.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Del Norte, Colorado (Elevation 7,884ft) \n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 61\n|Feb record high F = 68\n|Mar record high F = 73\n|Apr record high F = 80\n|May record high F = 87\n|Jun record high F = 91\n|Jul record high F = 91\n|Aug record high F = 89\n|Sep record high F = 87\n|Oct record high F = 81\n|Nov record high F = 70\n|Dec record high F = 62\n|year record high F = 91\n|Jan high F = 35.2\n|Feb high F = 40.1\n|Mar high F = 48.9\n|Apr high F = 58.2\n|May high F = 67.0\n|Jun high F = 75.4\n|Jul high F = 78.7\n|Aug high F = 76.6\n|Sep high F = 71.5\n|Oct high F = 62.1\n|Nov high F = 47.7\n|Dec high F = 37.0\n|year high F = 58.2\n|Jan low F = 5.7\n|Feb low F = 11.3\n|Mar low F = 19.1\n|Apr low F = 26.7\n|May low F = 34.8\n|Jun low F = 41.9\n|Jul low F = 47.7\n|Aug low F = 46.2\n|Sep low F = 39.1\n|Oct low F = 29.6\n|Nov low F = 18.0\n|Dec low F = 8.2\n|year low F = 27.4\n|Jan record low F = \u221234\n|Feb record low F = \u221225\n|Mar record low F = \u221216\n|Apr record low F = -4\n|May record low F = 10\n|Jun record low F = 26\n|Jul record low F = 32\n|Aug record low F = 30\n|Sep record low F = 15\n|Oct record low F = 2\n|Nov record low F = \u221220\n|Dec record low F = \u221226\n|year record low F = \u221234\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.33\n|Feb precipitation inch = 0.33\n|Mar precipitation inch = 0.67\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.70\n|May precipitation inch = 0.82\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.65\n|Jul precipitation inch = 1.45\n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.70\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.99\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.80\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.50\n|Dec precipitation inch = 0.45\n|year precipitation inch = 9.39\n|Jan snow inch = 5.8\n|Feb snow inch = 5.4\n|Mar snow inch = 7.5\n|Apr snow inch = 4.5\n|May snow inch = 1.3\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.2\n|Oct snow inch = 2.7\n|Nov snow inch = 5.6\n|Dec snow inch = 6.6\n|year snow inch = 39.7\n|source 1 = The Western Regional Climate Center<ref name=\"WRCC\">{{cite web\n| url =http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?co2184| title =Seasonal Temperature and Precipitation Information | accessdate =November 18, 2013 | publisher =Western Regional Climate Center | language = }}</ref>\n|date=November 2013\n}}\n\n== Notable people born here ==\n*[[Alva B.

Afterwards, the [[Ute people|Utes]] were known to live around Del Norte and the rest of the San Luis Valley going back hundreds and hundreds of years prior to Euro-American contact.  They lived here temporarily in the warmer months because of the abundance of wild game, plants, water, and timber in the area - winters were often too cold and harsh for them to settle permanently.  Spanish and Mexican peoples were the first non-natives to explore the nearby land, coming from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and other parts of New Mexico.  They were interested in surveying the 'Rio del Norte' or 'River of the North', hence the origin of the town's name.  This was the original name of the Rio Grande headwaters prior to numerous name changes over the years.  Under Mexican jurisdiction, Hispanic families began moving into the area during the early to mid-19th century as part of land grants to help the Mexican government fill and occupy the territory.  However, large-scale settlements were difficult to establish because the Utes were weary and very hostile towards Euro-American settlement, and would chase off many people who attempted to do so.  The most successful early settlement nearby was called 'La Loma', established a few miles east of where the current town site is today.  This area was chosen because there was a particular section of the Rio Grande here where it could be crossed safely and easily - one of few known for miles during this time.  After the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]] was signed in 1848, jurisdiction of the land in and around Del Norte transferred from Mexico to the United States, but settlement by Americans in the area was delayed by civil strive (including the [[American Civil War]]) throughout the 1850s and 1860s.  Most American settlements began in the area around the early 1870s by prospectors who were searching the nearby mountains for minerals such as gold and silver, particularly near an eventual boom-town named Summitville, located at the base of South Mountain near Bennett Peak.  These peaks in the [[San Juan Mountains]] were some of the last parts of Colorado where miners were allowed to explore and prospect for minerals, and they were finally able to do so after the Brunot Treaty was signed between the U.S. government and the Utes in 1873.  Once the mines proved profitable, Del Norte was officially established around 1874 in order to serve as a base camp for the mines not just in Summitville, but also in nearby [[Creede, Colorado|Creede]] and [[Lake City, Colorado|Lake City]].  Miners quickly moved into the area, and they were followed by ranchers and farmers.  Many of these original farming and ranching families still have operations and live in the Del Norte area to this day.  After the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, mining operations quickly became unprofitable and ceased.  The 'glory days' of Del Norte ended as quickly as they began, but the community still survived because of ranching and agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mt. Lookout: Where You Can See for Two Days|last=Colville|first=Ruth Marie|publisher=Benson Enterprises|year=1995|isbn=|location=Del Norte, CO|pages=|asin=B0043FGL1K}}</ref>  There was a small movement across southern Colorado throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s to secede from the State of Colorado and create the state of San Juan, with Del Norte becoming its capital city, however this secession movement died quickly.  Del Norte would see cycles of boom and bust throughout the 20th century, but has recently become a blossoming community due to the abundance of recreational activities provided by the area's unique geography; such as mountain biking, hiking, running, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, rafting and kayaking, cross country skiing, camping, etc.  Del Norte is also one of the communities which provides lodging for nearby [[Wolf Creek ski area|Wolf Creek Ski Area]].  Grande Avenue, the main street through Del Norte, still has many of the facades on its store fronts from the 1800s and early 1900s, reminding its residents and tourists of the town's historic past.  In 2019, the [[Rio Grande National Forest]] announced that it will be moving its headquarters from nearby [[Monte Vista, Colorado|Monte Vista]] to Del Norte, and the town announced that it will be improving its riverwalk to include a [[Rafting|white-water park]] along the Rio Grande.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:DelNortePeakInRioGrandeNationalForestColoradoNovember2011.JPG|thumb|left|Del Norte Peak rises above the town several miles to the west.]]\nDel Norte's absolute location is at {{coord|37|40|44|N|106|21|11|W|type:city}} (37.679015, -106.352976).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  Relatively-speaking, it is located where the [[Rio Grande]] leaves the San Juan Mountains and enters the [[San Luis Valley]], near its confluences with Pinos Creek and San Francisco Creek, respectively.  Due to its location on the western edge of the valley, a variety of climates, vegetation regions, and ecosystems transition into each other at or around Del Norte.  Within a twenty mile radius of the town, you can experience anything from alpine tundra, montane forests, to high-altitude desert.  Common vegetation around Del Norte ranges from coniferous pine trees, deciduous aspen trees and cottonwoods, to chico brush and cacti. During the warmer months of the year, [[Alcea|hollyhock]], [[Cosmos (flower)|cosmos]], [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]], and [[Helianthus|sunflowers]] are frequently found around the town.  Lookout Mountain (also known to locals as 'D' Mountain) overlooks the town, and is perhaps its most notable landmark.  The classification of 'mountain' has been a misnomer considering that 'D' Mountain has a mild [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] from the rest of the town (approximately 591 feet), and that there is nearby terrain with much greater prominence, however the classification has stuck since early settlement.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n[[File:DN Pronghorn 010520.jpg|thumb|Winter time on the Pronghorn Trail just south of Del Norte, looking east towards 'D' Mountain, the [[Sangre de Cristo Range|Sangres]], and the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Sand Dunes]].]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 729\n|1890= 736\n|1900= 705\n|1910= 840\n|1920= 1007\n|1930= 1410\n|1940= 1923\n|1950= 2048\n|1960= 1856\n|1970= 1569\n|1980= 1709\n|1990= 1674\n|2000= 1705\n|2010= 1686\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1563\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=January 11, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 1,705 people, 657 households, and 446 families residing in the town.  The [[population density]] was 2,004.4 people per square mile (774.5/km\u00b2).  There were 736 housing units at an average density of 865.2 per square mile (334.3/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the town was 66.86% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.12% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.06% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.41% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 27.68% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.87% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 57.36% of the population.\n\nThere were 657 households out of which 35.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.9% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.1% were non-families. 29.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.19.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 30.2% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 24.8% from 25 to 44, 22.9% from 45 to 64, and 12.8% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.7 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $23,833, and the median income for a family was $29,471. Males had a median income of $26,161 versus $21,406 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $12,751.  About 22.1% of families and 25.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 36.5% of those under age 18 and 14.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Climate==\n\nLike most places in the San Luis Valley, Del Norte is generally categorized in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] or [[Desert climate|desert]] climate.  Precipitation is the main factor that determines this classification, as it can fluctuate drastically from as many as 10-12 inches annually in a wetter year, to 2-3 inches or less during a drought year.  One reason precipitation varies greatly year to year is because the town is located in a [[rain shadow]] created by the [[San Juan Mountains]].  Because of this, precipitation is often determined by how strong and intense storm fronts are, and how these fronts move across the area.  This explains why Wolf Creek Ski Area, located about 28 miles west of town, receives on average over 400 inches of snow per year, while Del Norte receives about 10% of that amount - about 40 inches of snow annually.  Most precipitation falls in the form of rain or snow, hail and sleet are uncommon but not unheard of.  Generally, you can expect mild summers and cold winters, with spring and autumn varying between these.  Spring time in the area generally includes gusty winds, and many of the year's strongest snowstorms actually happen during this season.  Summer monsoons can hit the area as well, beginning late-July or early-August that last through the end of September.  During summer monsoons, the area generally experiences sunny mornings with clouds and storms moving in during the afternoon, and varying amounts of precipitation ranging from light drizzles of rain to brief, torrential downpours.  Like most of Colorado, night time temperatures can drop quickly and intensely due to the dry climate and the lack of moisture in the air.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Del Norte, Colorado (Elevation 7,884ft) \n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 61\n|Feb record high F = 68\n|Mar record high F = 73\n|Apr record high F = 80\n|May record high F = 87\n|Jun record high F = 91\n|Jul record high F = 91\n|Aug record high F = 89\n|Sep record high F = 87\n|Oct record high F = 81\n|Nov record high F = 70\n|Dec record high F = 62\n|year record high F = 91\n|Jan high F = 35.2\n|Feb high F = 40.1\n|Mar high F = 48.9\n|Apr high F = 58.2\n|May high F = 67.0\n|Jun high F = 75.4\n|Jul high F = 78.7\n|Aug high F = 76.6\n|Sep high F = 71.5\n|Oct high F = 62.1\n|Nov high F = 47.7\n|Dec high F = 37.0\n|year high F = 58.2\n|Jan low F = 5.7\n|Feb low F = 11.3\n|Mar low F = 19.1\n|Apr low F = 26.7\n|May low F = 34.8\n|Jun low F = 41.9\n|Jul low F = 47.7\n|Aug low F = 46.2\n|Sep low F = 39.1\n|Oct low F = 29.6\n|Nov low F = 18.0\n|Dec low F = 8.2\n|year low F = 27.4\n|Jan record low F = \u221234\n|Feb record low F = \u221225\n|Mar record low F = \u221216\n|Apr record low F = -4\n|May record low F = 10\n|Jun record low F = 26\n|Jul record low F = 32\n|Aug record low F = 30\n|Sep record low F = 15\n|Oct record low F = 2\n|Nov record low F = \u221220\n|Dec record low F = \u221226\n|year record low F = \u221234\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.33\n|Feb precipitation inch = 0.33\n|Mar precipitation inch = 0.67\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.70\n|May precipitation inch = 0.82\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.65\n|Jul precipitation inch = 1.45\n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.70\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.99\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.80\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.50\n|Dec precipitation inch = 0.45\n|year precipitation inch = 9.39\n|Jan snow inch = 5.8\n|Feb snow inch = 5.4\n|Mar snow inch = 7.5\n|Apr snow inch = 4.5\n|May snow inch = 1.3\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.2\n|Oct snow inch = 2.7\n|Nov snow inch = 5.6\n|Dec snow inch = 6.6\n|year snow inch = 39.7\n|source 1 = The Western Regional Climate Center<ref name=\"WRCC\">{{cite web\n| url =http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?co2184| title =Seasonal Temperature and Precipitation Information | accessdate =November 18, 2013 | publisher =Western Regional Climate Center | language = }}</ref>\n|date=November 2013\n}}\n\n== Notable people born here ==\n*[[Alva B.

Most of these programs originated from Sydney. As well as being heard on all of the network's affiliates, right across the country, they were also syndicated to non-network stations. With the coming of television in 1956, the radio audience for these types of programs dropped dramatically. Macquarie stations solved the ''problem'' by quickly increasing their news, talk, commentary and current affairs content.<ref name=\"R.R. Walker 1973\">\"The Magic Spark\", R.R.

Other former radio networks include: Federal Network; Associated Broadcasters of Australia; [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA Broadcasting]]. There were also a number of State-based networks.\n\nBy the late 1980s Macquarie had become Australia's only national commercial radio network.  However, during the last three decades, a number of new networks have arisen, including the [[Macquarie Regional RadioWorks]], unrelated to the Macquarie Radio Network.

Most of these programs originated from Sydney. As well as being heard on all of the network's affiliates, right across the country, they were also syndicated to non-network stations. With the coming of television in 1956, the radio audience for these types of programs dropped dramatically. Macquarie stations solved the ''problem'' by quickly increasing their news, talk, commentary and current affairs content.<ref name=\"R.R. Walker 1973\">\"The Magic Spark\", R.R. Walker, 1973, The Hawthorn Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1973, a significant year because it was the 50th anniversary of broadcasting in Australia, the Macquarie Network had the following affiliates: 2GB Sydney; [[2CA]] Canberra; [[Parkes, New South Wales|2PK]] Parkes; [[96.5 Wave FM|2WL]] Wollongong; [[3AW]] Melbourne; [[Magic 882|4BH]] Brisbane; [[4BU]] Bundaberg; [[4GY]] Gympie; [[Cruise 1323|5DN]] Adelaide; [[6iX (radio station)|6IX]] Perth; [[RadioWest South West|6BY]] Bunbury; [[RadioWest|6MD]] Merredin; [[RadioWest|6WB]] Katanning; [[7HO FM|7HO]] Hobart.<ref name=\"R.R.

Other former radio networks include: Federal Network; Associated Broadcasters of Australia; [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA Broadcasting]]. There were also a number of State-based networks.\n\nBy the late 1980s Macquarie had become Australia's only national commercial radio network.  However, during the last three decades, a number of new networks have arisen, including the [[Macquarie Regional RadioWorks]], unrelated to the Macquarie Radio Network.  In 2007, 13 networks owned or controlled 80 per cent of the 261 Australian commercial radio stations<ref>''Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio'', Bridget Griffen-Foley, UNSW Press, 2009; referenced as ''Commercial Radio: A Snapshot'', CRA, Sydney, 2007</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Macquarie entered a joint venture with [[Pacific Star Network]] to relaunch Melbourne radio station [[3MP]] as [[Melbourne Talk Radio|MTR 1377]]. On 2 March 2012, MTR ceased operations when Pacific Star was unable to pay any monies owed to Macquarie.<ref name=noworries>{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Ben|last2=Battersby|first2=Lucy|title='No worries' as MTR goes off the air|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/no-worries-as-mtr-goes-off-the-air-20120302-1u7ji.html|accessdate=5 March 2012|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=2 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304192120/http://www.theage.com.au/business/no-worries-as-mtr-goes-off-the-air-20120302-1u7ji.html|archive-date=4 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 2011, Macquarie acquired the Smart Radio Network which encompasses [[4VL]], [[West FM (Queensland)|Triple C FM]], [[4HI]], [[4ZR]], [[4LM]], [[4SB]] and [[Hot Country]] network at a cost of $6 million.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.

is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Fiona Apple]]. It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile. The title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The next month, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.1/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown only from the front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a [[centre stick]] and left hand [[throttle]]s. The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports on the sides of the canopy. The presence of the WSO (weapon systems operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment, thus decreasing the workload of the pilot and increasing efficiency.

Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown only from the front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a [[centre stick]] and left hand [[throttle]]s. The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports on the sides of the canopy. The presence of the WSO (weapon systems operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment, thus decreasing the workload of the pilot and increasing efficiency. Both cockpits are fitted with zero/zero [[ejection seat]]s which allow the crew to eject at any altitude and airspeed.<ref name=\"Dawes\" />\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:MiG-31 Foxhound aircraft armed with AA-9 missiles in flight.jpg|thumb|MiG-31 armed with [[R-33 (missile)|R-33]] missiles]]\n\nThe MiG-31's main armament is four [[Vympel R-33|R-33]] [[air-to-air missile]]s ([[NATO]] codename AA-9 'Amos') carried under the belly. \n*One [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23|GSh-6-23]] 23&nbsp;mm cannon with 260 rounds.\n*Fuselage recesses for four [[R-33 (missile)|R-33 (AA-9 'Amos')]] or six [[R-37 (missile)|R-37 (AA-13 'Arrow')]] (MiG-31M/BM only).\n*Four underwing pylons for a combination of (six places for charging<ref>{{cite web|url=http://samolet-mig-31.narod.ru|title=\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u041c\u0438\u0413-31|author=\u0414\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d|work=narod.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021075126/http://samolet-mig-31.narod.ru/|archive-date=21 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (two spaces to add removable fuel tanks<ref name=\"encyclopaedia-russia.ru\" />)):\n**Six [[R-37 (missile)]] long-range missiles {{convert|280|km|mi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/enc/fighter/mig31bm.html|title=\u041c\u0438\u0413 \u041c\u0438\u0413-31\u0411\u041c|work=airwar.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709015818/http://www.airwar.ru/enc/fighter/mig31bm.html|archive-date=9 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n**Four<ref name=\"arms-expo.ru\" />) [[R-33 (missile)]] long-range missiles {{convert|300|km|mi}} 2012.<ref name=\"dokwar.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://dokwar.ru/publ/aviacija_i_flot/mig_31bm_poluchat_novuju_raketu/15-1-0-583|title=\u041c\u0438\u0413-31\u0411\u041c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0443|work=dokwar.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027091756/http://dokwar.ru/publ/aviacija_i_flot/mig_31bm_poluchat_novuju_raketu/15-1-0-583|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n** (?)\u00d7 Kh-31 long-range missiles (200&nbsp;km) for high-speed target (maneuvering with an overload of 8&nbsp;G).<ref name=\"dokwar.ru\" />\n** (?)\u00d7 R-33 AA-9 \"Amos\" (1981) {{convert|120|km|mi}}, R-33S (1999) {{convert|160|km|mi}}.<ref>http://\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438.\u0440\u0444/russia/vympel/r/33/r33_1.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027092514/http://xn--80akhcovnjb1g.xn--p1ai/russia/vympel/r/33/r33_1.htm |date=27 October 2014 }}</ref>\n**Two<ref name=\"arms-expo.ru\" /> or four (superior limit)<ref name=\"modernforces.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.modernforces.ru/mig-31b/|title=\u041c\u0438\u0413-31\u0411|work=modernforces.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104802/http://www.modernforces.ru/mig-31b/|archive-date=29 April 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\u00d7 [[R-40 (missile)|R-40TD1 (AA-6 'Acrid')]] medium-range missiles (R-40 ({{convert|50|km|mi}}, MiG-25P, 1970) {{convert|80|km|mi}}(PD)(user)), height of applications between {{convert|0.5|-|3|km|mi}} (maneuvering with overload four&nbsp;g).<ref>http://\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438.\u0440\u0444/russia/bisnovat/r/40/r40.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422073038/http://xn--80akhcovnjb1g.xn--p1ai/russia/bisnovat/r/40/r40.htm |date=22 April 2016 }}</ref>\n**Four [[R-60 (missile)|R-60 (AA-8 'Aphid')]]\n***Four [[R-73 (missile)|R-73 (AA-11 'Archer')]] short-range IR missiles,\n***Four [[R-77]] (AA-12 'Adder') medium-range missiles (100 km) for high-speed target (maneuvering with overload of 12 G).<ref>http://\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438.\u0440\u0444/russia/vympel/r/77/r77.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510150627/http://xn--80akhcovnjb1g.xn--p1ai/russia/vympel/r/77/r77.htm |date=10 May 2017 }}</ref>\n*Some aircraft are equipped to launch the [[AS-17 Krypton|Kh-31P (AS-17 'Krypton')]] and [[AS-11 Kilter|Kh-58 (AS-11 'Kilter')]] [[anti-radiation missile]]s in the [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] (SEAD) role.

(North Carolina Maritime History Council).</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina became one of the English [[Thirteen Colonies]] and with the territory of [[South Carolina]] was originally known as the [[Province of North-Carolina]]. The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. [[Piracy|Pirates]] menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Quaker]], [[English American|English]] and [[German American|German]] [[immigrants]]. A majority of the colonists generally supported the [[American Revolution]], and a smaller number of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, New York.\n\nDuring colonial times, [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] served as the state capital beginning in 1722, and [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] was selected as the capital in 1766. Construction of [[Governor's Palace, New Bern|Tryon Palace]], which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor [[William Tryon]], began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788 [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the \"lost colony\" on [[Roanoke Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |title=Capitol History |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |author=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200430/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania plus immigrants from abroad.<ref>Wiki Article Historical Demography of the United States.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war of any state, as only 7,800 men joined the [[Continental Army]] under General [[George Washington]]; an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>Milton Ready, ''The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina'' (U. of South Carolina Press, 2005), pp. 116, 120.</ref> There was some military action, especially in 1780\u201381. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (later known as [[Tennessee]]), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the [[Northwest Territory]] could be organized and managed nationally.\n\nAfter 1800, cotton and [[tobacco]] became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] region, developed a slave society based on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] system and [[slavery|slave]] labor. Many [[free people of color]] migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than ten thousand. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]], with a strong [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presence, especially in the West. After [[Nat Turner]]'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote.\n\nOn May 20, 1861, North Carolina was the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. Some 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military; 20,000 were killed in battle, the most of any state in the Confederacy, and 21,000 died of disease. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and the state was the scene of only small battles.\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, the [[Reconstruction Era]] began. The United States abolished slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to [[freedmen]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] coalition of black freedmen, northern [[carpetbagger]]s and local [[scalawag]]s controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.\n\nPost civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDemocrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose [[Jim Crow]] and [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American [[United States Congress|congressmen]] through these years of the late 19th century.\n\nPolitical tensions ran so high that a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] government if their candidates were not elected. In the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected [[Alfred M. Waddell]] as mayor, in the only [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in United States history.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf \"Chapter 5\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002041/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for [[tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s for voter registration which [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black Americans in the state.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

It was not until 1992 that another [[African American]] was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.\n\nAs in the rest of the former Confederacy, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Impoverished by the Civil War and vicious debt cycles, the state continued with an economy based on [[tobacco]], cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the counties of the [[Piedmont Triad]], based on cotton mills established at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the [[Wright brothers]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.\n\nNorth Carolina was hard hit by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the [[Research Triangle]], a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center. Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].\n\nBy the 1970s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro Sit-ins]] played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.\n\n===Native Americans, lost colonies, and permanent settlement===\n\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States|Joara|Roanoke Island|Fort Raleigh National Historic Site}}\n[[File:The Carte of all the Coast of Virginia by Theodor de Bry 1585 1586.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the coast of [[Virginia]] and North Carolina, drawn 1585\u20131586 by [[Theodor de Bry]], based on map by [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] of the [[Roanoke Colony]]]]\n\nNorth Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. The [[Hardaway Site]] saw major periods of occupation as far back as 10,000 years. Before 200 AD, they were building [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]], which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient [[Mississippian culture]] established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont, continued to build or add on to such mounds. In the 500\u2013700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was [[Cahokia]], located in present-day Illinois near the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the [[Carolina Algonquian]]-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the [[Chowanoke]], [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]], [[Pamlico]], [[Machapunga]], [[Coree]], and [[Cape Fear Indians]], who were the first encountered by the English; the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Meherrin]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] of the interior; and Southeastern [[Siouan]] tribes, such as the [[Cheraw (tribe)|Cheraw]], [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw]], [[Saponi]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]].\n\nSpanish [[explorer]]s traveling inland in the 16th century met [[Mississippian culture]] people at [[Joara]], a regional [[chiefdom]] near present-day [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]]. Records of [[Hernando de Soto]] attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed ''Cuenca''. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to [[Mission Santa Elena|Santa Elena]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], then a center of [[Spanish Florida]]. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and [[archaeological]] findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.<ref name=richards/><ref>{{cite web|author1=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |first2=David G. |last2=Moore |first3=Robin A. |last3=Beck Jr. |first4=Christopher B. |last4=Rodning |title=Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world |volume=78 |issue=229 |publisher=Antiquity.ac.uk |date=March 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Croatoan.jpg|thumb|right|[[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] returns to find the colony abandoned]]\n\nIn 1584, [[Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of [[Virginia]]).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Randinelli\n|first=Tracey\n|title=Tanglewood Park\n|publisher=Harcourt\n|location=Orlando, Florida\n|page=16\n|url=\n|id=\n|isbn=978-0-15-333476-4 }}</ref> It was the second American territory which the English attempted to colonize.

The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain.\n\nMost of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African [[slave]]s or laborers was fluid. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status. Most of the [[free people of color|free colored]] families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men.

The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.\n\nOn April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the [[Halifax Resolves]] passed by the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]]. The date of this event is memorialized on the [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]]. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce [[guerrilla warfare]] erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at [[King's Mountain]] along the North Carolina\u2013South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of [[Tennessee]]) and [[southwest Virginia]] overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major [[Patrick Ferguson]]. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]]]]\n\nThe road to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and America's independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led through North Carolina. As the [[British Army]] moved north from victories in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Camden, South Carolina]], the Southern Division of the [[Continental Army]] and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General [[Daniel Morgan]]'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander [[Banastre Tarleton]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, southern commander [[Nathanael Greene]] led British Lord [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina.

Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in present-day [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on March 15, 1781. Although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the [[Royal Navy]] to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence.\n\n===Antebellum period===\n\n{{Main|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In 1840, it completed the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]] building in Raleigh, still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], or [[South Carolina]], significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] in the Piedmont. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding \"yeoman\" farmers of western North Carolina. In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a {{convert|129|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} wooden plank road, known as a \"farmer's railroad\", from [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the east to [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] (northwest of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n[[File:Map North Carolina roads and railroads 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Map]] of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854]]\n\nBesides slaves, there were a number of [[free people of color]] in the state.

In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] that was followed through by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] on December 4, 1865. Congressional Republicans during the Reconstruction, commonly referred to as \"[[radical Republicans]]\", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was also adopted that same year, it remained [[Jim Crow laws|in most cases]] ineffective for almost a century\u2014not to mention paramilitary groups and their [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] with impunity.\n\nThe elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the [[North Carolina State Legislature]]. In attempt to put the reforms into effect, the new Republican Governor [[William W. Holden]] declared martial law on any county allegedly not complying with law and order using the passage of the [[Shoffner Act]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geography of North Carolina}}\n[[File:North Carolina K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate types of North Carolina]]\n[[File:North carolina topographic.jpg|thumb|right|North Carolina topographic map.

The coastal plain consists of more specifically-defined areas known as the [[Outer Banks]], a string of sandy, narrow [[barrier islands]] separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including [[Albemarle Sound]] and [[Pamlico Sound]], the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|tidewater]] region, the native home of the [[venus flytrap]], and the inner coastal plain, where [[longleaf pine]] trees are native.\n\nSo many ships have been lost off [[Cape Hatteras]] that the area is known as the \"[[Graveyard of the Atlantic]]\"; more than a thousand ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526. The most famous of these is the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' (flagship of the pirate [[Blackbeard]]), which went aground in Beaufort Inlet in 1718.<ref>{{cite web| title=Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge Coming Back to Beaufort| website=Beach Carolina Magazine| date=March 30, 2011| url=http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221030139/http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| archivedate=February 21, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]], the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers.

Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state.

Before the Civil War, the Baptists split into regional associations of the North and South, over the issue of slavery.\n\nBy the late 19th century, the largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina was the [[Baptist]], when both whites and blacks were considered, but the latter people had set up their own organizations. After [[emancipation]], black Baptists quickly set up their own independent congregations in North Carolina and other states of the South, as they wanted to be free of white supervision.<ref name=\"brooks\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church|last=Brooks|first=Walter Henderson (1851\u20131945)|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=7|number=1|date=January 1922|pages=11\u201322|access-date=19 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830234438/https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live|doi=10.2307/2713578|jstor=2713578}}</ref><ref name=\"raboteau\"/><ref>Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp. 52\u201353</ref> Black Baptists developed their own state and national associations, such as the [[National Baptist Convention USA, Inc.]].<ref name=\"raboteau\">Albert J.

[[Presbyterians]], historically Scots-Irish, have had a strong presence in [[Charlotte]] and in [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland County]].\n\nCurrently, the rapid influx of [[Northern United States|northerners]] and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing ethnic and religious diversity: the number of [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Judaism|Jews]] in the state has increased, as well as general religious diversity. The second-largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina after Baptist traditions is [[Methodism]], which is strong in the northern Piedmont, especially in populous [[Guilford County]].

According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas.

These consist of the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]] (led by the [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]), the [[bicameral]] legislature (called the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]]), and the state court system (headed by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]]). The [[Constitution of North Carolina|state constitution]] delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nNorth Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw [[Tar Heel]] voters elect a bicameral [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican]] majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern [[swing state]] in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s comfortable victory in the state [[1976 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1976]], the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat [[Barack Obama]] narrowly won the state [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 2008]]. In the 1990s, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] came within a point of winning the state [[1992 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1992]] and also only narrowly lost the state [[1996 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1996]]. In the early 2000s, Republican [[George W. Bush]] easily won the state by more than 12 points.\n\nBy 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the [[Research Triangle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|2012]], North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in Charlotte. However, Republican [[Mitt Romney]] ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]]) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the state elected a Republican Governor ([[Pat McCrory]]) and Lieutenant Governor ([[Dan Forest]]) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | North Carolina registered voters {{as of|2019|November|16|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegStat/Stats?Date=11/16/2019&CountyName=Totals|title=Voter Registration Statistics|publisher=[[North Carolina State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. [[Piracy|Pirates]] menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Quaker]], [[English American|English]] and [[German American|German]] [[immigrants]]. A majority of the colonists generally supported the [[American Revolution]], and a smaller number of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, New York.\n\nDuring colonial times, [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] served as the state capital beginning in 1722, and [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] was selected as the capital in 1766. Construction of [[Governor's Palace, New Bern|Tryon Palace]], which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor [[William Tryon]], began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788 [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the \"lost colony\" on [[Roanoke Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |title=Capitol History |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |author=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200430/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania plus immigrants from abroad.<ref>Wiki Article Historical Demography of the United States.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war of any state, as only 7,800 men joined the [[Continental Army]] under General [[George Washington]]; an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>Milton Ready, ''The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina'' (U. of South Carolina Press, 2005), pp. 116, 120.</ref> There was some military action, especially in 1780\u201381. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (later known as [[Tennessee]]), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the [[Northwest Territory]] could be organized and managed nationally.\n\nAfter 1800, cotton and [[tobacco]] became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] region, developed a slave society based on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] system and [[slavery|slave]] labor. Many [[free people of color]] migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than ten thousand. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]], with a strong [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presence, especially in the West. After [[Nat Turner]]'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote.\n\nOn May 20, 1861, North Carolina was the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. Some 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military; 20,000 were killed in battle, the most of any state in the Confederacy, and 21,000 died of disease. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and the state was the scene of only small battles.\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, the [[Reconstruction Era]] began. The United States abolished slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to [[freedmen]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] coalition of black freedmen, northern [[carpetbagger]]s and local [[scalawag]]s controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.\n\nPost civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDemocrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose [[Jim Crow]] and [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American [[United States Congress|congressmen]] through these years of the late 19th century.\n\nPolitical tensions ran so high that a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] government if their candidates were not elected. In the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected [[Alfred M. Waddell]] as mayor, in the only [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in United States history.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf \"Chapter 5\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002041/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for [[tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s for voter registration which [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black Americans in the state.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

It was not until 1992 that another [[African American]] was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.\n\nAs in the rest of the former Confederacy, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Impoverished by the Civil War and vicious debt cycles, the state continued with an economy based on [[tobacco]], cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the counties of the [[Piedmont Triad]], based on cotton mills established at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the [[Wright brothers]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.\n\nNorth Carolina was hard hit by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the [[Research Triangle]], a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center. Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].\n\nBy the 1970s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro Sit-ins]] played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.\n\n===Native Americans, lost colonies, and permanent settlement===\n\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States|Joara|Roanoke Island|Fort Raleigh National Historic Site}}\n[[File:The Carte of all the Coast of Virginia by Theodor de Bry 1585 1586.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the coast of [[Virginia]] and North Carolina, drawn 1585\u20131586 by [[Theodor de Bry]], based on map by [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] of the [[Roanoke Colony]]]]\n\nNorth Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. The [[Hardaway Site]] saw major periods of occupation as far back as 10,000 years. Before 200 AD, they were building [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]], which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient [[Mississippian culture]] established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont, continued to build or add on to such mounds. In the 500\u2013700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was [[Cahokia]], located in present-day Illinois near the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the [[Carolina Algonquian]]-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the [[Chowanoke]], [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]], [[Pamlico]], [[Machapunga]], [[Coree]], and [[Cape Fear Indians]], who were the first encountered by the English; the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Meherrin]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] of the interior; and Southeastern [[Siouan]] tribes, such as the [[Cheraw (tribe)|Cheraw]], [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw]], [[Saponi]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]].\n\nSpanish [[explorer]]s traveling inland in the 16th century met [[Mississippian culture]] people at [[Joara]], a regional [[chiefdom]] near present-day [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]]. Records of [[Hernando de Soto]] attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed ''Cuenca''. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to [[Mission Santa Elena|Santa Elena]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], then a center of [[Spanish Florida]]. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and [[archaeological]] findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.<ref name=richards/><ref>{{cite web|author1=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |first2=David G. |last2=Moore |first3=Robin A. |last3=Beck Jr. |first4=Christopher B. |last4=Rodning |title=Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world |volume=78 |issue=229 |publisher=Antiquity.ac.uk |date=March 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Croatoan.jpg|thumb|right|[[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] returns to find the colony abandoned]]\n\nIn 1584, [[Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of [[Virginia]]).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Randinelli\n|first=Tracey\n|title=Tanglewood Park\n|publisher=Harcourt\n|location=Orlando, Florida\n|page=16\n|url=\n|id=\n|isbn=978-0-15-333476-4 }}</ref> It was the second American territory which the English attempted to colonize.

The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.\n\nOn April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the [[Halifax Resolves]] passed by the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]]. The date of this event is memorialized on the [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]]. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce [[guerrilla warfare]] erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at [[King's Mountain]] along the North Carolina\u2013South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of [[Tennessee]]) and [[southwest Virginia]] overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major [[Patrick Ferguson]]. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]]]]\n\nThe road to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and America's independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led through North Carolina. As the [[British Army]] moved north from victories in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Camden, South Carolina]], the Southern Division of the [[Continental Army]] and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General [[Daniel Morgan]]'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander [[Banastre Tarleton]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, southern commander [[Nathanael Greene]] led British Lord [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina. This campaign is known as \"The Race to the Dan\" or \"The Race for the River\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Cowan's Ford]], Cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the [[Catawba River]] at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, in an attempt to engage General Morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal.<ref>Stonestreet, Ottis C.

Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in present-day [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on March 15, 1781. Although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the [[Royal Navy]] to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence.\n\n===Antebellum period===\n\n{{Main|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In 1840, it completed the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]] building in Raleigh, still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], or [[South Carolina]], significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] in the Piedmont. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding \"yeoman\" farmers of western North Carolina. In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a {{convert|129|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} wooden plank road, known as a \"farmer's railroad\", from [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the east to [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] (northwest of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n[[File:Map North Carolina roads and railroads 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Map]] of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854]]\n\nBesides slaves, there were a number of [[free people of color]] in the state.

During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]].\n\nDuring the antebellum period, North Carolina was an overwhelmingly rural state, even by Southern standards. In 1860 only one North Carolina town, the port city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], had a population of more than 10,000. [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], the state capital, had barely more than 5,000 residents.\n\nWhile slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population of 992,622, were enslaved African Americans.<ref name=census>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Browser:Census Data for Year 1860 |date=2004 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |website=University of Virginia Library |url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archivedate=October 11, 2014 |df= }}</ref> They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]].

Some of the yeoman farmers in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War, while some covertly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause during the conflict. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the [[Union Army]] and fought for the North in the war. Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state, which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free.\n\nConfederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]], which was a futile attempt by Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston|Joseph Johnston]] to slow Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> In April 1865, after losing the [[Battle of Morrisville]], Johnston surrendered to Sherman at [[Bennett Place]], in what is today [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]. North Carolina's port city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865, after the Union won the nearby [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]], its major defense downriver.\n[[File:2008-08-16 Bennett Place historic site.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bennett Place]] historic site in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]]]\n\nThe first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina, in the [[Battle of Big Bethel]] in June 1861. At the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in [[Pickett's Charge|Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge]] and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment. During the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield. At [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia in April 1865, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the Civil War. For many years, North Carolinians proudly boasted that they had been \"First at Bethel, Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and Last at Appomattox\".\n\n===Reconstruction===\n\n{{Main|Reconstruction era}}\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Confederacy in 1865, North Carolina, along with the rest of the former Confederate States, was put under direct control by the [[U.S. military]] and was relieved of its [[Constitution of North Carolina|constitutional government]] and representation within the [[United States Congress]] in what is now referred to as the [[Reconstruction era]]. In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] that was followed through by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] on December 4, 1865. Congressional Republicans during the Reconstruction, commonly referred to as \"[[radical Republicans]]\", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was also adopted that same year, it remained [[Jim Crow laws|in most cases]] ineffective for almost a century\u2014not to mention paramilitary groups and their [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] with impunity.\n\nThe elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the [[North Carolina State Legislature]]. In attempt to put the reforms into effect, the new Republican Governor [[William W.

While North Carolina's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth, low unemployment, and rising wages, many of the state's rural counties have suffered from job loss, rising levels of poverty, and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas.

These consist of the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]] (led by the [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]), the [[bicameral]] legislature (called the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]]), and the state court system (headed by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]]). The [[Constitution of North Carolina|state constitution]] delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nNorth Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw [[Tar Heel]] voters elect a bicameral [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican]] majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern [[swing state]] in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s comfortable victory in the state [[1976 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1976]], the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat [[Barack Obama]] narrowly won the state [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 2008]]. In the 1990s, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] came within a point of winning the state [[1992 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1992]] and also only narrowly lost the state [[1996 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1996]]. In the early 2000s, Republican [[George W. Bush]] easily won the state by more than 12 points.\n\nBy 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the [[Research Triangle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|2012]], North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in Charlotte. However, Republican [[Mitt Romney]] ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]]) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the state elected a Republican Governor ([[Pat McCrory]]) and Lieutenant Governor ([[Dan Forest]]) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | North Carolina registered voters {{as of|2019|November|16|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegStat/Stats?Date=11/16/2019&CountyName=Totals|title=Voter Registration Statistics|publisher=[[North Carolina State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

Western North Carolina pork barbecue uses a tomato-based sauce, and only the pork shoulder (dark meat) is used. Western North Carolina barbecue is commonly referred to as Lexington barbecue after the [[Piedmont Triad]] town of [[Lexington, North Carolina|Lexington]], home of the [[Lexington Barbecue Festival]], which attracts more than 100,000 visitors each October.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bob Garner's Guide to North Carolina Barbecue | last = Garner | first = Bob | url = https://books.google.com/?id=PswNCQWI9RsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=north+carolina+barbecue | publisher=John F.

The Yadkin Valley in particular has become a strengthening market for grape production, while [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] recently won the recognition of being named 'Beer City USA'. [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] boasts the largest [[North Carolina breweries#Breweries|breweries]] per capita of any city in the United States.

Research Triangle Park, a large industrial complex located in the Raleigh-Durham area, is one of the major centers in the country for electronics and medical research.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[Tobacco]] was one of the first major industries to develop after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many farmers grew some tobacco, and the invention of the cigarette made the product especially popular. Winston-Salem is the birthplace of [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] (RJR), founded by [[R. J. Reynolds]] in 1874 as one of 16 tobacco companies in the town. By 1914 it was selling 425 million packs of Camels a year. Today it is the second-largest tobacco company in the U.S. (behind [[Altria Group]]). RJR is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc., which in turn is 42% owned by [[British American Tobacco]].<ref>Nannie M. Tilley, ''The R.J.
