The Chief Minister who visited the site ordered the withdrawal of the recognition of the three schools, prosecution of the school authorities and the correspondent, and the suspension of the Chief Educational Officer, the District Elementary Educational Officer, and the Assistant Elementary Educational Officer of the Thanjavur school district. A compensation of {{INR}} 1,000,000 was provided to the next of the kin of the deads, {{INR}} 25,000 to the severely injured, and {{INR}} 10,000 to other injured victims from the Chief Minister\u2019s Public Relief Fund. The district administration arranged another primary school in Natham village and accommodated 46 students under the Educational Guarantee Scheme of the government.\n\nThe state government constructed a memorial park near Palakarai, Kumbakonam in memory of the lost lives, opening on 6 June 2010. The government also allotted housing plots to 59 homeless parents of 89 deceased students.\n\nAfter a long delay, a trial began on 24 September 2012 in the Thanjavur district court. The case had 21 accused people and had 488 witnesses that included 18 children who survived the accident. The headmaster Prabharan and three others were charged. Charges were also filed against 17 others, including Pulavar Palanichamy, his wife and correspondent of the school Saraswati, three teachers, six officers of the Elementary Education Department, the Kumbakonam municipal commissioner, the town planning officer, and four assistants of the education department. On 30 July 2014, the court sentenced school founder Pulavar Palanichamy to life imprisonment and fined {{INR}} 51,65,700. Ten others, including school staff and officials from Kumbakonam and state education department, were sentenced to five years imprisonment. Eleven of those accused, including three teachers, were acquitted.\n\n==Background==\nThere were three schools namely, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School, Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School and Sri Krishna Girls High School, operating in the same building in Kasiraman street in Kumbakonam in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The school was located amidst residential buildings, {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} away from the main road.<ref name=\"report103\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 103</ref> The school had a small gate {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, immediately beyond which the classrooms were located. The classrooms did not have any partition and at the end of the classrooms, there was a stage. On the northwest side of the stage was the noon meal kitchen and a cycle stand, both of which were thatched structures.<ref name=\"report107\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 107</ref> The northern wing in the ground floor accommodated the Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School, which had six classes, one each for LKG, UKG, I, II, IV and V. There was another entrance to the school on the eastern side. \n\nThe buildings in the nursery and primary schools had no ventilation. Near the eastern entrance, there was a narrow staircase {{convert|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide leading to the first floor of the building. The layout of the first floor was similar to the ground floor where classes had no separation and exit was through a narrow collapsible door. The lower end of the class on the western side was connected to the noon meal kitchen thatched roof and the cycle stand roof, where the accident occurred. The Sri Krishna Girls High School had 179, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School had 477 and Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School had 126 students in its roles, totalling to 782 students. The second floor measured {{convert|62.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} * {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} and had classes for standards VI, VII, VIII and IX of the girls high school. The third floor had an open terrace having a water tank.<ref name=\"report111\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 111-114</ref>\n\n==Accident==\nOn 16 July 2004, the fire tragedy occurred on thatched roof structure of the school. The school started at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. and during one of the breaks at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., one of the girls noticed the fire and alerted the teacher and the news spread to other classes.<ref name=\"report115\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 115</ref> The fire sparked from the midday meal kitchen thatch and spread to the upper level, which also had thatched roofs and spread rapidly. The narrow staircase had sundry material, that prevented the exit of children. The staircase was also located close to the kitchen. The kitchen did not have gas stoves and fire logs were used for cooking. The school was overcrowded, having 900 children enrolled.<ref name=\"report115\"/><ref name=\"Teets103\">[[#Teets|Teets 2007]], p. 103-4</ref><ref>[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 2007]], p. 67</ref> The thatches and the supporting bamboo poles caught fire and fell on the children and also blocked the exit. \n\nThe fire service was informed at 11 a.m. and the personnel arrived in a few minutes. But since they were unprepared for such a large scale fire, the rescue services were not effective. The locals also helped by breaking the concrete window.<ref name=\"report115\" /> The injured children were admitted to the government hospital in Kumbakonam and some of them later got shifted to Thanjavur Medical College hospital. \n\n=== Victims ===\nThe deceased children were taken to the government hospital for postmortem. By the end of the day, 76 children were reported deceased and the district administration had handed over the bodies to the parents. The Collector of the district arranged for temporary wards in the government hospital for the parents to identify their wards.

Sampath to inquire into the circumstances and causes leading to the fire accident on 20 July 2004. The committee assumed office on 1 August 2004 and was constituted with expert members Dr Rani Kandhaswami (Former Principal, Lady Willington Institute of Advanced Studies in Education, Chennai), S.K. Saxena (Fire Officer, Madras Atomic Power Station, Kalpakkam), K. Vijayan (Clinical Psychologist, Institute of Mental Health, Chennai) and P.A. Annamalai (retired Head Master).<ref name=\"report1\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], pp. 1-2</ref>\n\nThe committee was given a timeline of four months but extended for four times and it was able to finally complete the investigation on 30 June 2005.\nThe investigations found out that the school was not inspected by the educational official for three years. The fire officials reported that the building laws were not followed as the school had a thatched kitchen and classroom roof, had no emergency exits and it was a \"death trap\".<ref name=\"Walsh51\">[[#Walsh|Walsh 2011]], pp. 51-52</ref><ref>[[#Banerjee|Banerjee 2006]], p. 298</ref> The school had to follow minimum safety standards, the chapter IV on fire and safety of National Building Code of India 2005 and IS 14435:1997, the code of practice of fire safety in educational institutions.<ref>[[#Walsh|Walsh 2011]], p. 57</ref> A public interest litigation was filed in the [[Supreme Court of India]] by Avinash Mehrotra quoting the accident and pleading protection of life and safety of school children across various schools in India.<ref name=\"Walsh51\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Avinash Mehrotra vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 April, 2009|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/232115/|publisher=Indian Kanoon|last=D.|first=Bhandari|date=13 April 2009|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe school teachers were not trained properly to handle the situation. The investigation revealed that the role of teachers was highly questionable. One view held that most of them found ways to escape themselves rather than saving the children as many came out unscathed. Some of the student eyewitnesses revealed that the teachers asked them to remain in the classes. However, some hold that the teachers tried their best to rescue the children and some of them asked the children to stay in the classes as they believed the fire was just regular smoke from the kitchen.<ref name=\"Teets103\"/><ref name=\"report116\"/>\n\n[[File:Kumbakonam fire accident 1.jpg|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire memorial located near Kaveri bridge|300px|left]]\nThe committee found that the major reason for the heavy casualty was the false tactics of the management to bring the other two school students to the aided primary school to mislead the inspecting authorities about the student-teacher ratio. The management was held responsible for the whole accident. The report pointed out that the teachers were not trained in disaster management and the prohibited thatch structure was close to the classrooms. It also stated that the schools had inadequate exit facilities and had no firefighting capabilities. Pulavar Palanichamy, the owner of the schools, was reported to have used his political clout and coalesced with the municipal and the revenue department officials getting the permits for the schools. Vijayalakshmi, the noon meal organizer and also the teacher of the English Medium School, was held accountable for not performing her duties of taking safety precautions. \n\nVasanthi, the head cook lit the oven in the absence of her assistant, Sivasankari, who usually lights it. There were contrasting reports on whether Sivasankari was present in the school during the event. The Tahsildar of Kumbakonam Taluk, Paramasivam, was reported \"dishonest\" for granting a license under the Tamil Nadu Public Buildings (Licensing) Act, 1965 to the school. The chartered engineer Jayachandran was also held dishonest of giving stability certificate to the building without visiting the school once. The additional assistant educational officer, Madhavan for allowing the school to run without recognition for 6 years. Sivaprakasam, the assistant elementary education officer, was held accountable for allowing Madhavan, who was not competent to allow a permit to the school. Balaji, the deputy education elementary officer was accused of carelessly passing the papers signed by Madhavan. The local health officer r Dr Sivapunyam was accused of giving false sanitary certificate to the school. Annadurai, a friend of Pulavar Palanichamy was accounted for advising circumvention of rules. Pingapani, the deputy educational officer, who inspected the high school, did not show interest in learning that the same campus had a primary school acting beyond rules. The other officers who were earlier responsible for permitting the nursery school against the rules during 1999, namely, Shanmughavelu, Sethuramachandran, Chandrasekharan and Dr.Palanivelu. The Deputy elementary educational officer, Durairaj and assistant elementary educational officer, Balakrishnan, were held less culpable for knowing about the thatched structure and the exaggerated attendance, but not initiating any action.<ref name=\"report133\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 133-138</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{quote box\n| border=2px\n| align=right\n| bgcolor = Cornsilk\n| font = Times\n|width  = 30%\n| title=<u>Prayer for departed children of Kumbakonam</u>\n| halign=center\n| quote=<poem>\n\"Oh dear little ones!

The school was located amidst residential buildings, {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} away from the main road.<ref name=\"report103\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 103</ref> The school had a small gate {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, immediately beyond which the classrooms were located. The classrooms did not have any partition and at the end of the classrooms, there was a stage. On the northwest side of the stage was the noon meal kitchen and a cycle stand, both of which were thatched structures.<ref name=\"report107\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 107</ref> The northern wing in the ground floor accommodated the Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School, which had six classes, one each for LKG, UKG, I, II, IV and V.

Near the eastern entrance, there was a narrow staircase {{convert|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide leading to the first floor of the building. The layout of the first floor was similar to the ground floor where classes had no separation and exit was through a narrow collapsible door. The lower end of the class on the western side was connected to the noon meal kitchen thatched roof and the cycle stand roof, where the accident occurred. The Sri Krishna Girls High School had 179, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School had 477 and Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School had 126 students in its roles, totalling to 782 students. The second floor measured {{convert|62.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} * {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} and had classes for standards VI, VII, VIII and the IX of the girls high school. The third floor had an open terrace having a water tank.<ref name=\"report111\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 111-114</ref>\n\n==Accident==\nOn 16 July 2004, the fire tragedy occurred on thatched roof structure of the school.

The narrow staircase had sundry material, that prevented the exit of children. The staircase was also located close to the kitchen. The kitchen did not have gas stoves and fire logs were used for cooking. The school was overcrowded, having 900 children enrolled.<ref name=\"report115\"/><ref name=\"Teets103\">[[#Teets|Teets 2007]], p. 103-4</ref><ref>[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 2007]], p. 67</ref> The thatches and the supporting bamboo poles caught fire and fell on the children and also blocked the exit. \n\nThe fire service was informed at 11 a.m. and the personnel arrived in a few minutes. But since they were unprepared for such a large scale fire, the rescue services were not effective.

The committee assumed office on 1 August 2004 and was constituted with expert members Dr Rani Kandhaswami (Former Principal, Lady Willington Institute of Advanced Studies in Education, Chennai), S.K. Saxena (Fire Officer, Madras Atomic Power Station, Kalpakkam), K. Vijayan (Clinical Psychologist, Institute of Mental Health, Chennai) and P.A.

The investigation revealed that the role of teachers was highly questionable. One view held that most of them found ways to escape themselves rather than saving the children as many came out unscathed. Some of the student eyewitnesses revealed that the teachers asked them to remain in the classes. However, some hold that the teachers tried their best to rescue the children and some of them asked the children to stay in the classes as they believed the fire was just regular smoke from the kitchen.<ref name=\"Teets103\"/><ref name=\"report116\"/>\n\n[[File:Kumbakonam fire accident 1.jpg|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire memorial located near Kaveri bridge|300px|left]]\nThe committee found that the major reason for the heavy casualty was the false tactics of the management to bring the other two school students to the aided primary school to mislead the inspecting authorities about the student-teacher ratio. The management was held responsible for the whole accident. The report pointed out that the teachers were not trained in disaster management and the prohibited thatch structure was close to the classrooms. It also stated that the schools had inadequate exit facilities and had no firefighting capabilities. Pulavar Palanichamy, the owner of the schools, was reported to have used his political clout and coalesced with the municipal and the revenue department officials getting the permits for the schools. Vijayalakshmi, the noon meal organizer and also the teacher of the English Medium School, was held accountable for not performing her duties of taking safety precautions. \n\nVasanthi, the head cook lit the oven in the absence of her assistant, Sivasankari, who usually lights it. There were contrasting reports on whether Sivasankari was present in the school during the event. The Tahsildar of Kumbakonam Taluk, Paramasivam, was reported \"dishonest\" for granting a license under the Tamil Nadu Public Buildings (Licensing) Act, 1965 to the school. The chartered engineer Jayachandran was also held dishonest of giving stability certificate to the building without visiting the school once. The additional assistant educational officer, Madhavan for allowing the school to run without recognition for 6 years. Sivaprakasam, the assistant elementary education officer, was held accountable for allowing Madhavan, who was not competent to allow a permit to the school. Balaji, the deputy education elementary officer was accused of carelessly passing the papers signed by Madhavan. The local health officer r Dr Sivapunyam was accused of giving false sanitary certificate to the school. Annadurai, a friend of Pulavar Palanichamy was accounted for advising circumvention of rules. Pingapani, the deputy educational officer, who inspected the high school, did not show interest in learning that the same campus had a primary school acting beyond rules. The other officers who were earlier responsible for permitting the nursery school against the rules during 1999, namely, Shanmughavelu, Sethuramachandran, Chandrasekharan and Dr.Palanivelu. The Deputy elementary educational officer, Durairaj and assistant elementary educational officer, Balakrishnan, were held less culpable for knowing about the thatched structure and the exaggerated attendance, but not initiating any action.<ref name=\"report133\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 133-138</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{quote box\n| border=2px\n| align=right\n| bgcolor = Cornsilk\n| font = Times\n|width  = 30%\n| title=<u>Prayer for departed children of Kumbakonam</u>\n| halign=center\n| quote=<poem>\n\"Oh dear little ones!

{"title_page": "John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton", "text_new": "{{redirect|John Berkeley}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:1stLordBerkeley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lord Berkeley of Stratton]]\n'''John  Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton''' (1602 \u2013  26 August 1678) was an English royalist soldier, politician and diplomat, of the [[Bruton branch of the Berkeley family]].  From 1648 he was closely associated with [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], and rose to prominence, fortune, and fame. He and [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]] were the founders of the [[Province of New Jersey]], a British colony in North America that would eventually become the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]].\n\n==Early life==\nBerkeley was the second son of Sir Maurice Berkeley and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew of Hanworth. His elder brother was [[Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge]]; his younger brother, [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]], served as royal governor of the colony of Virginia from 1642 to 1652 and again from 1660 to 1677. John Berkeley was accredited ambassador from [[Charles I of England]] to [[Christina of Sweden]], in January 1637, to propose a joint effort by the two sovereigns for the reinstatement of the [[elector palatine]] in his dominions; probably the employment of Berkeley in this by his cousin, [[Sir Thomas Roe]], who had conducted negotiations between Gustavus Adolphus and the king of Poland. Berkeley returned from Sweden in July 1637. He had a commission in the army against the Scots in 1638 and was knighted at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in that year. In 1640 he was returned to parliament for both Heytesbury and Reading, electing to retain his seat for the former place. Next year he was accused in parliament of complicity in the Army Plots, expelled from the house, and committed to the [[Tower of London]]; he was subsequently bailed by [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset]] and [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford]] in the sum of \u00a310,000, but the outbreak of hostilities prevented any further steps being taken.<ref name = DNB>{{DNB|wstitle=Berkeley, John, first Baron Berkeley of Stratton}}</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War==\nBerkeley took a conspicuous part in the [[First English Civil War]], supporting the royal cause. He became governor of [[Exeter]], and General of the royalist forces in [[Devon]].\n\nIn 1642 he joined the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]] at [[Sherborne]], and was sent into Cornwall with the rank of commissary-general to act under [[Sir Ralph Hopton]] as lieutenant-general. The royalist forces defeated, in May 1643, the Earl of Stamford at the [[battle of Stratton]], with great loss of baggage and artillery, and pursued him as far as [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. In this affair, Sir John distinguished himself and was now made commander-in-chief of all the royalist forces in Devon. He sat down before Exeter, into which the Earl of Stamford had withdrawn, and which was further defended by the fleet under [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick]]. Berkeley succeeded in maintaining a blockade, beating off the Earl of Warwick with a loss of three ships, and on 4 September 1643 the Earl of Stamford was compelled to surrender.<ref name = DNB/> In 1644 Berkeley was present at the baptism of [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta Maria]], the king's daughter, who was born at Exeter. The same year Hopton and Berkeley joined their forces to oppose [[Sir William Waller]]'s westward advance, but were badly beaten at the [[Battle of Cheriton]] near [[Old Alresford|Alresford]] in [[Hampshire]] on 29 March. In April 1645 he superseded [[Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grenville]], being made colonel-general of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, took Wellington House, near [[Taunton]], by assault, and then proceeded to invest Taunton. The advance of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] westward in the autumn of the year changed the aspect of affairs. In January 1646 Fairfax was able to concentrate on Exeter, which Berkeley was forced (13 April) to surrender, on honorable terms.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==Involvement in the Hampton Court escape==\n\nAfter the surrender of the royalist forces, Berkeley joined his kinsman, [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans|Lord Jermyn]], in attendance upon Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. Having persuaded the queen that he possessed influence with some of the principal officers in the army, he obtained from her a letter of recommendation to the king. Having gained access to the king, he set about using his influence with [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]], and others, with a view to mediating between them and the captive king; he was supported by [[John Ashburnham (MP)|John Ashburnham]]. The result was that a set of propositions emanating from the chiefs of the army were submitted to the king as a basis of reconciliation in July 1647. These the king scornfully rejected.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBerkeley received the king's commands to attend him in his flight from [[Hampton Court]] on the night of 10 November 1647. The party pushed on towards Hampshire, and ultimately reached [[Lymington]]. Berkeley crossed the [[Solent]] and opened the matter to [[Robert Hammond (Governor)|Robert Hammond]], parliamentary governor of the [[Isle of Wight]] which was the king's goal; Hammond was non-committal. The envoys then conducted Hammond to the king at Lymington, an act later much criticized. Charles felt he had no choice but saw nothing for it but to accompany Hammond to [[Carisbrooke Castle]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nAfter this exploit Berkeley returned to London, still bent upon using his influence with the army. Being badly received by the officers, and arraigned by the parliament as a [[delinquent (royalist)|delinquent]], he returned to Paris.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==In exile==\n\nIn Paris, during the absence of [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron]] in England, he obtained, through the influence, as it would seem, of [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans]], the post of temporary governor to the Duke of York (1648), and on the death of Byron (1652) took over the position. He acquired the control of the Duke's finances and endeavored to bring about a match between the Duke and [[Marie d'Orleans-Longueville, Duchess de Nemours|Marie de Longueville]], but the French court refused approval. Berkeley himself paid court to [[Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton]], widowed in 1651; she turned him down, perhaps on advice from [[Sir Edward Hyde]]. Berkeley and Hyde became enemies.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBetween 1652 and 1655 Berkeley served under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] in the campaigns against [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]], and the Spaniards in Flanders, accompanying the Duke of York as a volunteer. When the Duke placed his sword at the disposal of Spain and crossed over into the Netherlands early in 1656, he was still accompanied by Berkeley. In the spring of the next year he made a tour with the Duke through some of the principal cities of the Netherlands, took part in the campaigns of that and the following year, and at the request of the duke was raised to the peerage as Baron Berkeley of Stratton, in Cornwall, by a patent dated at Brussels 19 May 1658.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==After the Restoration==\n[[File:Twickenham Park House.jpg|thumb|Twickenham Park House]]\nOn the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] Berkeley was put on the staff of the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]]. In 1661 he was appointed [[Lord President of Connaught]] for life, a deputy being appointed to do the work of the office in Ireland. In 1663 (17 June) Berkeley was sworn a member of the [[Privy Council]], and in the following year was made one of the Masters of Ordinance. In January 1665 Berkeley was placed on the Committee of [[Tangier]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nIn the same year, he began building Berkeley House, a palace in the Italian style, near [[Piccadilly]]. It cost nearly \u00a330,000 and was completed about 1673, upon Berkeley's return from Ireland. Renamed [[Devonshire House]] after its purchase by [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]], in 1697, the house burned down in 1733 and was replaced by a second Devonshire House.\n\nIn 1668 Berkeley bought [[Twickenham Park]]. In 1670 he went to Ireland as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], holding the office for two years, with a few months' leaves of absence. He was considered pro-Catholic, and to favor Archbishop [[Peter Talbot (archbishop)|Peter Talbot]] to the extent of allowing him to use a silver plate to add to the magnificence of a religious celebration, and expressing a desire to see a high mass at Christ Church. In December 1675 Berkeley was appointed, with [[Sir William Temple]] and [[Sir Leoline Jenkyns]], ambassador extraordinary on the part of England at the [[Congress of Nijmegen]] then about to assemble, but bad health both delayed his departure for Nijmegen, which he finally reached in November 1676, and caused him to return the following May, before the conference finished.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==New Jersey interests==\n\nBerkeley's personal relationships with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the Duke of York led to his receiving an interest in New Jersey, in addition to that in [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] previously received. Berkeley was co-proprietor of New Jersey from 1664 to 1674. In 1665, Berkeley and [[Sir George Carteret]] drafted the [[Concession and Agreement]], a proclamation for the structure of the government for the Province of New Jersey. The document also provided [[freedom of religion]] in the colony. Berkeley sold his share to a group of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] because of the political difficulties between [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Richard Nicolls]], Carteret, and himself. This effectively split New Jersey into two colonies: [[East Jersey]], belonging to Carteret, and [[West Jersey]]. The division remained until 1702 when West Jersey went bankrupt; the [[The Crown|Crown]] then took back and subsequently re-unified the colony.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nOn 26 August 1678 John Berkeley died, aged seventy-two years. He was buried on 5 September in [[St Mary's, Twickenham|St Mary's Church]], [[Twickenham]].<ref name = DNB/> A memorial window commemorates him and his brother Sir William Berkeley.<ref>Warren M. Billings, ''Sir William Berkeley and the Forging of Colonial Virginia'' (2010), p. 268</ref>\n\nAlthough John Berkeley held many distinguished offices, some authorities assert that, at one time, he was under a cloud, in consequence of his being detected in the selling of offices, and other corrupt practices. [[Samuel Pepys]] speaks of him as being esteemed \"a fortunate, though a passionate, and but weak man as to policy\", and \"the hottest, fiery man in discourse, without any cause\", he ever saw. Berkeley was notorious for spinning incredible tales of his exploits; Clarendon wrote that through constant re-telling he may have come to believe them himself.{{More citations needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Family==\n\nBerkeley married Christian or Christiana Riccard, daughter of [[Andrew Riccard|Sir Andrew Riccard]], a wealthy London merchant, in the [[East India Company]]; she had already been married first to Sir John Geare, and subsequently (14 February 1659) to Henry Rich, Lord Kensington, son of Robert Rich, 5th [[Earl of Warwick]]. He left three sons, each of whom succeeded in his turn to the title, and one daughter, Anne, who married Sir Dudley Cullum, Bart., of Hanstead, Suffolk.

From 1648 he was closely associated with [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], and rose to prominence, fortune, and fame. He and [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]] were the founders of the [[Province of New Jersey]], a British colony in North America that would eventually become the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]].\n\n==Early life==\nBerkeley was the second son of Sir Maurice Berkeley and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew of Hanworth. His elder brother was [[Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge]]; his younger brother, [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]], served as royal governor of the colony of Virginia from 1642 to 1652 and again from 1660 to 1677. John Berkeley was accredited ambassador from [[Charles I of England]] to [[Christina of Sweden]], in January 1637, to propose a joint effort by the two sovereigns for the reinstatement of the [[elector palatine]] in his dominions; probably the employment of Berkeley in this by his cousin, [[Sir Thomas Roe]], who had conducted negotiations between Gustavus Adolphus and the king of Poland. Berkeley returned from Sweden in July 1637. He had a commission in the army against the Scots in 1638 and was knighted at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in that year. In 1640 he was returned to parliament for both Heytesbury and Reading, electing to retain his seat for the former place. Next year he was accused in parliament of complicity in the Army Plots, expelled from the house, and committed to the [[Tower of London]]; he was subsequently bailed by [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset]] and [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford]] in the sum of \u00a310,000, but the outbreak of hostilities prevented any further steps being taken.<ref name = DNB>{{DNB|wstitle=Berkeley, John, first Baron Berkeley of Stratton}}</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War==\nBerkeley took a conspicuous part in the [[First English Civil War]], supporting the royal cause. He became governor of [[Exeter]], and General of the royalist forces in [[Devon]].\n\nIn 1642 he joined the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]] at [[Sherborne]], and was sent into Cornwall with the rank of commissary-general to act under [[Sir Ralph Hopton]] as lieutenant-general. The royalist forces defeated, in May 1643, the Earl of Stamford at the [[battle of Stratton]], with great loss of baggage and artillery, and pursued him as far as [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. In this affair, Sir John distinguished himself and was now made commander-in-chief of all the royalist forces in Devon. He sat down before Exeter, into which the Earl of Stamford had withdrawn, and which was further defended by the fleet under [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick]]. Berkeley succeeded in maintaining a blockade, beating off the Earl of Warwick with a loss of three ships, and on 4 September 1643 the Earl of Stamford was compelled to surrender.<ref name = DNB/> In 1644 Berkeley was present at the baptism of [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta Maria]], the king's daughter, who was born at Exeter. The same year Hopton and Berkeley joined their forces to oppose [[Sir William Waller]]'s westward advance, but were badly beaten at the [[Battle of Cheriton]] near [[Old Alresford|Alresford]] in [[Hampshire]] on 29 March. In April 1645 he superseded [[Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grenville]], being made colonel-general of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, took Wellington House, near [[Taunton]], by assault, and then proceeded to invest Taunton. The advance of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] westward in the autumn of the year changed the aspect of affairs. In January 1646 Fairfax was able to concentrate on Exeter, which Berkeley was forced (13 April) to surrender, on honorable terms.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==Involvement in the Hampton Court escape==\n\nAfter the surrender of the royalist forces, Berkeley joined his kinsman, [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans|Lord Jermyn]], in attendance upon Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. Having persuaded the queen that he possessed influence with some of the principal officers in the army, he obtained from her a letter of recommendation to the king. Having gained access to the king, he set about using his influence with [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]], and others, with a view to mediating between them and the captive king; he was supported by [[John Ashburnham (MP)|John Ashburnham]]. The result was that a set of propositions emanating from the chiefs of the army were submitted to the king as a basis of reconciliation in July 1647. These the king scornfully rejected.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBerkeley received the king's commands to attend him in his flight from [[Hampton Court]] on the night of 10 November 1647. The party pushed on towards Hampshire, and ultimately reached [[Lymington]]. Berkeley crossed the [[Solent]] and opened the matter to [[Robert Hammond (Governor)|Robert Hammond]], parliamentary governor of the [[Isle of Wight]] which was the king's goal; Hammond was non-committal. The envoys then conducted Hammond to the king at Lymington, an act later much criticized. Charles felt he had no choice but saw nothing for it but to accompany Hammond to [[Carisbrooke Castle]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nAfter this exploit Berkeley returned to London, still bent upon using his influence with the army. Being badly received by the officers, and arraigned by the parliament as a [[delinquent (royalist)|delinquent]], he returned to Paris.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==In exile==\n\nIn Paris, during the absence of [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron]] in England, he obtained, through the influence, as it would seem, of [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans]], the post of temporary governor to [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] (1648), and on the death of Byron (1652) took over the position. He acquired the control of the Duke's finances and endeavored to bring about a match between the Duke and [[Marie d'Orleans-Longueville, Duchess de Nemours|Marie de Longueville]], but the French court refused approval. Berkeley himself paid court to [[Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton]], widowed in 1651; she turned him down, perhaps on advice from [[Sir Edward Hyde]]. Berkeley and Hyde became enemies.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBetween 1652 and 1655 Berkeley served under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] in the campaigns against [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]], and the Spaniards in Flanders, accompanying the Duke of York as a volunteer. When the Duke placed his sword at the disposal of Spain and crossed over into the Netherlands early in 1656, he was still accompanied by Berkeley. In the spring of the next year he made a tour with the Duke through some of the principal cities of the Netherlands, took part in the campaigns of that and the following year, and at the request of the duke was raised to the peerage as Baron Berkeley of Stratton, in Cornwall, by a patent dated at Brussels 19 May 1658.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==After the Restoration==\n[[File:Twickenham Park House.jpg|thumb|Twickenham Park House]]\nOn the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] Berkeley was put on the staff of the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]]. In 1661 he was appointed [[Lord President of Connaught]] for life, a deputy being appointed to do the work of the office in Ireland. In 1663 (17 June) Berkeley was sworn a member of the [[Privy Council]], and in the following year was made one of the Masters of Ordinance. In January 1665 Berkeley was placed on the Committee of [[Tangier]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nIn the same year, he began building Berkeley House, a palace in the Italian style, near [[Piccadilly]]. It cost nearly \u00a330,000 and was completed about 1673, upon Berkeley's return from Ireland. Renamed [[Devonshire House]] after its purchase by [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]], in 1697, the house burned down in 1733 and was replaced by a second Devonshire House.\n\nIn 1668 Berkeley bought [[Twickenham Park]]. In 1670 he went to Ireland as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], holding the office for two years, with a few months' leaves of absence. He was considered pro-Catholic, and to favor Archbishop [[Peter Talbot (archbishop)|Peter Talbot]] to the extent of allowing him to use a silver plate to add to the magnificence of a religious celebration, and expressing a desire to see a high mass at Christ Church. In December 1675 Berkeley was appointed, with [[Sir William Temple]] and [[Sir Leoline Jenkyns]], ambassador extraordinary on the part of England at the [[Congress of Nijmegen]] then about to assemble, but bad health both delayed his departure for Nijmegen, which he finally reached in November 1676, and caused him to return the following May, before the conference finished.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==New Jersey interests==\n\nBerkeley's personal relationships with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the Duke of York led to his receiving an interest in [[New Jersey]], in addition to that in [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] previously received. Berkeley was co-proprietor of New Jersey from 1664 to 1674. In 1665, Berkeley and [[Sir George Carteret]] drafted the [[Concession and Agreement]], a proclamation for the structure of the government for the [[Province of New Jersey]]. The document also provided [[freedom of religion]] in the colony. Berkeley sold his share to a group of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] because of the political difficulties between [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Richard Nicolls]], Carteret, and himself. This effectively split New Jersey into two colonies: [[East Jersey]], belonging to Carteret, and [[West Jersey]]. The division remained until 1702 when West Jersey went bankrupt; the [[The Crown|Crown]] then took back and subsequently re-unified the colony.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nOn 26 August 1678 John Berkeley died, aged seventy-two years. He was buried on 5 September in [[St Mary's, Twickenham|St Mary's Church]], [[Twickenham]].<ref name = DNB/> A memorial window commemorates him and his brother [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]].<ref>Warren M. Billings, ''Sir William Berkeley and the Forging of Colonial Virginia'' (2010), p. 268</ref>\n\nAlthough John Berkeley held many distinguished offices, some authorities assert that, at one time, he was under a cloud, in consequence of his being detected in the selling of offices, and other corrupt practices. [[Samuel Pepys]] speaks of him as being esteemed \"a fortunate, though a passionate, and but weak man as to policy\", and \"the hottest, fiery man in discourse, without any cause\", he ever saw. Berkeley was notorious for spinning incredible tales of his exploits; Clarendon wrote that through constant re-telling he may have come to believe them himself.{{Refimprove|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Family==\n\nBerkeley married Christian or Christiana Riccard, daughter of [[Andrew Riccard|Sir Andrew Riccard]], a wealthy London merchant, in the [[East India Company]]; she had already been married first to Sir John Geare, and subsequently (14 February 1659) to Henry Rich, Lord Kensington, son of Robert Rich, 5th [[Earl of Warwick]]. He left three sons, each of whom succeeded in his turn to the title, and one daughter, Anne, who married Sir Dudley Cullum, Bart., of Hanstead, Suffolk. The title became extinct in 1773.<ref name = DNB/><ref>http://thepeerage.com/p6784.htm#i67837</ref>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*''New Jersey Archives'', First Series.

The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/01/10/deals/amr_twa/|title=TWA to be bought by American - Jan. 10, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the [[DC-3]], which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO [[C. R. Smith]] to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the [[DC-2]] to replace American's [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss Condor II]] biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was {{convert|66|in|m}} wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST ([[Douglas Sleeper Transport]]) first flew on December 17, 1935, (the 32nd anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' flight at Kitty Hawk). Its cabin was {{convert|92|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14\u201316 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.<ref>Pearcy, Arthur. ''Douglas DC-3 Survivors, Volume 1''.

This entitled the pass holder to fly anywhere in the world. 28 were sold. However, after some time, the airline realised they were making losses on the tickets, with the ticketholders costing them up to $1 million each. Ticketholders were booking large amounts of flights, and some ticketholders flying interstate for lunch or flying to London multiple times a month. AA raised the cost of the lifetime pass to $3 million, and then finally stopped offering it in 2003.

The flight crew in the cockpit ignored the warning, as on a prior flight, a [[fume event]] had occurred due to a problem with the [[auxiliary power unit]]. However, the smoke on Flight 132 was caused by improperly packaged hazardous materials. According to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] inquiry, the cockpit crew persistently refused to acknowledge that there was a serious threat to the aircraft or the passengers, even after they were told that floor was becoming soft and passengers had to be reseated. As a result, the aircraft was not evacuated immediately on landing, exposing the crew and passengers to the threat of smoke and fire longer than necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a02a/6b1ff0725d682e3ab0fa55681a1db46af4ad.pdf|title=Chute, Rebecca D., and Earl L.

The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/01/10/deals/amr_twa/|title=TWA to be bought by American - Jan. 10, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the [[DC-3]], which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO [[C. R. Smith]] to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the [[DC-2]] to replace American's [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss Condor II]] biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was {{convert|66|in|m}} wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST ([[Douglas Sleeper Transport]]) first flew on December 17, 1935, (the 32nd anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' flight at Kitty Hawk). Its cabin was {{convert|92|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14\u201316 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.<ref>Pearcy, Arthur. ''Douglas DC-3 Survivors, Volume 1''.

He says some scholars have noted that, \"originally the professions of Kayastha (scribe) and Vaidya (physician) were not restricted and could be followed by people from different varnas including the brahmanas.

Between that time and the 11th\u201312th century, this category of officials or scribes was  composed of \"putative\" [[Kshatriya]]s and, \"for the larger majority\", [[Bengali Brahmins|Brahmin]]s, who retained their caste identity or became Buddhists. As in [[South India]], Bengal had lacked a clearly defined Kshatriya caste. The [[Pala Empire|Pala]], Sena, [[Candra|Chandra]], and [[Varman dynasty|Varman]] dynasties and their descendants, who claimed the status of Kshatriya, \"almost imperceptibly merged\" with the Kayastha caste and became \"the region's surrogate Kshatriya or warrior class\". {{sfnp|Wink|1991|p=269|ps=}}\n\nSekhar Bandyopadhyay also places their emergence as a caste after the Gupta period.

He says some scholars have noted that, \"originally the professions of Kayastha (scribe) and Vaidya (physician) were not restricted and could be followed by people from different varnas including the brahmanas. So there is every probability that a number of brahmana families were mixed up with members of other varnas in forming the present Kayastha and Vaidya communities of Bengal.\"{{sfnp|Sharma|1978|p=115|ps=}}\n\nHistorians P. C. Choudhuri, K. R. Medhi and [[Kanaklal Barua|K. L. Barua]] state that \"the Brahmins noted in the [[Nidhanpur copperplate inscription|Nidhanpur]] and Dubi inscriptions of king [[Bhaskaravarman]]\" bore surnames \"which are at present used by Kayasthas of Bengal and [[Nagar Brahmins|Nagara Brahmins]] of [[Gujarat]],\" and \"were either of the [[Alpine race|Alpine]] origin or pre-Vedic [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]].\" Similarly, the Kayasthas and [[Kalita (caste)|Kalitas]] of [[Assam]] \"are also supposed to be descendants of extra-Vedic Aryans\".<ref name=\"contemporary1998\">{{cite book|author1=S.

Between that time and the 11th\u201312th century, this category of officials or scribes was  composed of \"putative\" [[Kshatriya]]s and, \"for the larger majority\", [[Bengali Brahmins|Brahmin]]s, who retained their caste identity or became Buddhists. As in [[South India]], Bengal had lacked a clearly defined Kshatriya caste. The [[Pala Empire|Pala]], Sena, [[Candra|Chandra]], and [[Varman dynasty|Varman]] dynasties and their descendants, who claimed the status of Kshatriya, \"almost imperceptibly merged\" with the Kayastha caste and became \"the region's surrogate Kshatriya or warrior class\". {{sfnp|Wink|1991|p=269|ps=}}\n\nSekhar Bandyopadhyay also places their emergence as a caste after the Gupta period. Referring to the linkages between class and caste in Bengal, he mentions that the Kayasthas along with the Brahmins and [[Baidya]]s, refrained from physical labour but controlled land, and as such represented \"the three traditional higher castes of Bengal\".<ref name=\"CasteCulture&Hegemony\">{{cite book|first=Sekhar |last=Bandyopadhyay|title=Caste, Culture, and Hegemony: Social Dominance in Colonial Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPqHAwAAQBAJ&q=kayastha#v=snippet&q=kayastha&f=false|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications | isbn=81-7829-316-1 | page=20}}</ref> Eaton mentions that the Kayasthas continued as the \"dominant landholding caste\" even after the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]], and absorbed the descendants of the region's old Hindu rulers. {{sfnp|Eaton|1996|p=102|ps=}}\n\nProfessor [[Julius J.

The Maulika had four further \"ranked grades\". The ''Uttara-radhi'' and ''Varendra'' used the terms \"Siddha\", \"Sadhya\", \"Kasta\" and \"Amulaja\" to designate the grades in their subcastes.{{sfnp|Inden|1976|p=34|ps=}}\n\n===Origin myths===\n[[Kulin Kayastha]]s have an associated myth of origin stating that five Kayasthas accompanied the Brahmins from [[Kannauj]] who had been invited to Bengal by the mythological king Adisur.
