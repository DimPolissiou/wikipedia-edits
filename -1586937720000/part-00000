Harriman Memorial Awards Institute]].\nOn January 5, 2012, UP announced to its employees that for the first time in ninety-eight years the Harriman award would be retired after the 2012 award ceremony. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) made the decision to end the award presentation.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.railwayage.com/breaking-news/commentary-was-it-time-for-the-harrimans-to-go-3867.html |title=COMMENTARY: Was it time for the Harrimans to go?  |author=WILLIAM C.

Part of the award criteria has been a count of the number of reported workplace injuries as tracked by the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA); this has led to disciplinary action and even dismissal for employees at some railroads.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes| date=September 1999| url=http://glo.bmwe.org/public/journal/1999/09sep/a03.htm| title=BMWE Journal: FRA Committee Reviewing Safety Award Criteria| accessdate=January 11, 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617153049/http://glo.bmwe.org/public/journal/1999/09sep/a03.htm| archive-date=June 17, 2006| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Union Pacific Railroad (UP), in particular, was shown to have suppressed reporting of some accidents in the early 1970s, leading to their disqualification and withdrawal from consideration for the award over several years.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/34623205/casper_startribune/| via=Newspapers.com| title=UP's safety failure noted| first1=Dan| last1=Partridge| first2=Bill| last2=Scott| newspaper=Casper Star-Tribune| location=Casper, WY| date=January 10, 1977| page=1}} {{open access}}</ref> UP launched an intensive safety program and again earned a Harriman gold medal in 1984.<ref name=AJ19850505 /> \n\nSeveral rail [[trade union|labor union]]s objected to the criteria, going so far as to picket the award ceremonies.  [[Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes]]<!--Note, \"Employes\" spelling is correct --> (BMWE) General Chairman Paul Beard created the \"Harassment Award\" as a satire of the Harriman Awards to raise awareness of management practices that bred intimidation and disciplinary actions against reporting accidents.  In 1999 the FRA invited discussions with representatives of rail labor unions to discuss the problem.\n\n==Recipients==\nThe selection process included a rule that the same railroad company could not be selected for a gold medal in two consecutive years.<ref name=FT19670928 /> This practice ended in the 1970s when Santa Fe Railroad was selected as the gold medal recipient for several consecutive years.\n\nRailroad companies are grouped into one of four categories:\n* Group A railroads are line-haul railroads with greater than 15&nbsp;million employee hours per year.\n* Group B railroads are line-haul railroads with between 4 and 15&nbsp;million employee hours per year.\n* Group C railroads are line-haul railroads with less than 4&nbsp;million employee hours per year.\n* Group S&T railroads are switching and terminal railroads\n\nHistorically, the award recipients were notified in May of the year following the statistics calculation with the presentation ceremony in September or October.  Later the award announcements and presentations were made in May of the year after the award designation; for example, the 2004 awards were presented in May 2005.  Past recipients of the E.H.

[[Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes]]<!--Note, \"Employes\" spelling is correct --> (BMWE) General Chairman Paul Beard created the \"Harassment Award\" as a satire of the Harriman Awards to raise awareness of management practices that bred intimidation and disciplinary actions against reporting accidents.  In 1999 the FRA invited discussions with representatives of rail labor unions to discuss the problem.\n\n==Recipients==\nThe selection process included a rule that the same railroad company could not be selected for a gold medal in two consecutive years.<ref name=FT19670928 /> This practice ended in the 1970s when Santa Fe Railroad was selected as the gold medal recipient for several consecutive years.\n\nRailroad companies are grouped into one of four categories:\n* Group A railroads are line-haul railroads with greater than 15&nbsp;million employee hours per year.\n* Group B railroads are line-haul railroads with between 4 and 15&nbsp;million employee hours per year.\n* Group C railroads are line-haul railroads with less than 4&nbsp;million employee hours per year.\n* Group S&T railroads are switching and terminal railroads\n\nHistorically, the award recipients were notified in May of the year following the statistics calculation with the presentation ceremony in September or October.

Born in [[Covington, Tennessee]], he released a record on [[Sun Records]] in 1954, just after [[Elvis Presley]].\n\nYelvington began performing in local venues at the age of 14, having learned to sing and play guitar as a boy. His voice was a [[baritone]], somewhat comparable to [[Ernest Tubb]] (one of Yelvington's major influences). He continued with mostly local engagements into his 20s, and was passed over for military service in [[World War II]] because of his health. In the late 1940s, he began playing with [[Reece Fleming]]'s band, [[The Tennesseans]], at the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] [[Gem Theater]]. This group disbanded in 1952, and several of its members, including Yelvington, picked up with local troupe the Star Rhythm Boys. They performed daily on local radio and had a steady and popular gig at the Clover Club north of Covington, but family attachments prevented most of the players from traveling or touring with the group. Yelvington began playing side gigs in Memphis whenever he wasn't playing with the Star Rhythm Boys.\n\nYelvington and guitarist [[Gordon Mashburn]] first heard word of [[Sam Phillips]]'s [[Sun Records]] in 1953, and arranged a meeting. Philips was initially unimpressed with Yelvington and the Star Rhythm Boys, because he was not interested in recording straight-ahead country music; however, he thought the band had potential, and had them audition a large number of songs. The first cut he recorded with them was a [[blues music|blues]] number written by [[Stick McGhee]] called \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\". The result was a record with blues roots and a blues feel but a [[steel guitar]] that sounded unmistakably country. This recording was issued on Sun Records immediately after [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[That's All Right Mama]]\". Phillips did not give Yelvington promotional backing, and so he and the band self-marketed the record to local stations, to little avail. The record was picked up neither by blues nor by country radio stations, each of which seemed to think it sounded too much like the other.\n\n\"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was one out of only two records Yelvington cut for Sun. In 1955 he released a single, \"Yakety Yak\" (not the same tune as \"[[Yakety Yak]]\" by [[The Coasters]]), on competitor [[Meteor Records]]. The record was released under the name Mac Sales and the Esquire Trio so as to avoid [[lawsuit|legal action]] by Phillips, to whom he was still contractually obliged. In 1956, Yelvington recorded again with Sun, releasing the rockabilly track \"Rockin' With My Baby\".\n\nYelvington, now in his late thirties, was not excited about the rockabilly sound, and by 1958 he and his band members parted ways. Yelvington struck out on his own as a solo artist, but had no luck and eventually quit music, concentrating on raising his family of five children. He was essentially forgotten until the 1980s, when popular music historians began digging into the Sun back catalogue; fans and concert promoters attempted to bring him out of retirement.

Born in [[Covington, Tennessee]], he released a record on [[Sun Records]] in 1954, just after [[Elvis Presley]].\n\nYelvington began performing in local venues at the age of 14, having learned to sing and play guitar as a boy. His voice was a [[baritone]], somewhat comparable to [[Ernest Tubb]] (one of Yelvington's major influences). He continued with mostly local engagements into his 20s, and was passed over for military service in [[World War II]] because of his health. In the late 1940s, he began playing with [[Reece Fleming]]'s band, [[The Tennesseeans]], at the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] [[Gem Theater]]. This group disbanded in 1952, and several of its members, including Yelvington, picked up with local troupe the Star Rhythm Boys. They performed daily on local radio and had a steady and popular gig at the Clover Club north of Covington, but family attachments prevented most of the players from traveling or touring with the group. Yelvington began playing side gigs in Memphis whenever he wasn't playing with the Star Rhythm Boys.\n\nYelvington and guitarist [[Gordon Mashburn]] first heard word of [[Sam Phillips]]'s [[Sun Records]] in 1953, and arranged a meeting. Philips was initially unimpressed with Yelvington and the Star Rhythm Boys, because he was not interested in recording straight-ahead country music; however, he thought the band had potential, and had them audition a large number of songs. The first cut he recorded with them was a [[blues music|blues]] number written by [[Stick McGhee]] called \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\". The result was a record with blues roots and a blues feel but a [[steel guitar]] that sounded unmistakably country. This recording was issued on Sun Records immediately after [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[That's All Right Mama]]\". Phillips did not give Yelvington promotional backing, and so he and the band self-marketed the record to local stations, to little avail. The record was picked up neither by blues nor by country radio stations, each of which seemed to think it sounded too much like the other.\n\n\"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was one out of only two records Yelvington cut for Sun. In 1955 he released a single, \"Yakety Yak\" (not the same tune as \"[[Yakety Yak]]\" by [[The Coasters]]), on competitor [[Meteor Records]]. The record was released under the name Mac Sales and the Esquire Trio so as to avoid [[lawsuit|legal action]] by Phillips, to whom he was still contractually obliged. In 1956, Yelvington recorded again with Sun, releasing the rockabilly track \"Rockin' With My Baby\".\n\nYelvington, now in his late thirties, was not excited about the rockabilly sound, and by 1958 he and his band members parted ways. Yelvington struck out on his own as a solo artist, but had no luck and eventually quit music, concentrating on raising his family of five children. He was essentially forgotten until the 1980s, when popular music historians began digging into the Sun back catalogue; fans and concert promoters attempted to bring him out of retirement. His career saw a resurgence in Memphis as a rockabilly revivalist, and in 1997, he released his first full-length album at the age of 79. By the time of his death in 2001, in Memphis, he was regarded{{By whom|date=November 2015}} as an elder statesman of country music and rockabilly.\n\nA live show in the Netherlands during his first European tour in 1988 was taped and released on [[Collector Records]] (CLCD 4403) in 1991. In 2006, [[Bear Family Records]] reissued his Sun Records recordings on compact disc.\n\nOn February 22, 2018, the song \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" b/w \"Just Rolling Along\" by Malcolm Yelvington and the Star Rhythm Boys was accepted into the [[Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"100\" | Title\n! width=\"50\" | [[Record label]]\n|-----\n| 1955 || \"Drinkin\u2019 Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" / \"Just Rolling Around\" || [[Sun Records]]\n|----\n| 1955 || \"Yakety Yak\" / \"A Gal Named Joe\" || [[Meteor Records]]\n|----\n| 1957 || \"Rockin\u2019 With My Baby\" / \"It's Me, Baby\" || Sun Records\n|----\n| ||\n* \"Have My Self a Ball\"\n* \"Rock and Roll With My Baby\"\n* \"Goodbye Marie\"\n* \"I\u2019ve Got The Blues (Way Down Blues)\"\n* \"Mr. Blues\"\n* \"My First and Last Love\"\n* \"Trumpet\"\n|| Sun Records (not issued)\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p140316|pure_url=yes}} Malcolm Yelvington] at [[AllMusic]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yelvington, Malcolm}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country rock singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Covington, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Singers from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Meteor Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "Mandarax", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing; if the band's name is actually spelled that way, please restore and add [sic]", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Yelvington"}

Indoor tanning resources are almost ubiquitous today and could be considered as a means for people to get UV exposure when dermatologist provided phototherapy is not available. Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to [[erythema|erythemogenic]] doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques. It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.<ref name=\"radack\">{{cite journal|last1=Radack|first1=KP|last2=Farhangian|first2=ME|last3=Anderson|first3=KL|last4=Feldman|first4=SR|title=A review of the use of tanning beds as a dermatological treatment|journal=Dermatology and Therapy|date=March 2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=37\u201351|doi=10.1007/s13555-015-0071-8|pmid=25735439|pmc=4374067}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Risks of UV light therapy -->\nUV light therapies all have risks; tanning beds are no exception, being listed by the [[World Health Organization]] as carcinogens.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors=((World Health Organization)) | title=Artificial tanning devices: public health interventions to manage sunbeds | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | date=15 June 2017 | hdl=10665/255695 | isbn=9789241512596 }}</ref> Exposure to UV light is known to increase the risks of melanoma, squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas; younger people with psoriasis, particularly those under age 35, are at increased risk from melanoma from UV light treatment.

Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to [[erythema|erythemogenic]] doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques.

The [[mechanism of action]] of PUVA is unknown, but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin.
