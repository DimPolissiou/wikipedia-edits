Skeletal features indicate that Malagasy hippos were better adapted for [[Cursorial|running]] than African hippos. ''H. lemerlei'' remains have been found in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a semiaquatic lifestyle similar to that of ''H. amphibious'', while many ''C. madagascariensis'' remains have found in Madagascar's [[Madagascar subhumid forests|forested highlands]], indicating a more terrestrial lifestyle.\n\n*Family: [[Hippopotamidae]] (hippopotamuses)\n**Genus: ''[[Choeropsis]]''\n*** [[Malagasy hippopotamus#C. madagascariensis|Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus]], ''Choeropsis madagascariensis'' '''EX''' ([[prehistoric|PH]])\n**Genus: ''[[Hippopotamus (genus)|Hippopotamus]]''\n*** [[Malagasy hippopotamus#H. laloumena|Lesser Malagasy hippopotamus]], ''Hippopotamus laloumena'' '''EX''' ([[prehistoric|PH]])\n*** [[Malagasy hippopotamus#H. lemerlei|Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus]], ''Hippopotamus lemerlei'' '''EX''' (PH)\n\n======Infraorder: [[Cetacea]] (whales, dolphins and porpoises)======\n----\n{{See also|Whaling in Madagascar}}\n[[File:Balaenoptera omurai, Madagascar - Royal Society Open Science 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Omura's whale]] off [[Nosy Be]]]]\n[[File:humpback whale Sainte Marie Madagascar July 2013.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Humpback whale]] off [[\u00cele Sainte-Marie]]]]\n[[File:Humpback Whale, \u00cele Sainte-Marie (3954152044).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Southern right whale]], \u00cele Sainte-Marie]]\n[[File:Kogia breviceps.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Pygmy sperm whale]]]]\n[[File:Tursiops aduncus.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin]]]]\n[[File:Schlankdelfin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Pantropical spotted dolphin]]]]\n[[File:Spinner dolphin jumping.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Spinner dolphin]]]]\n[[File:Fraser s group.jpg.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Fraser's dolphin]]s]]\n[[File:Anim2623 (33910332184).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Melon-headed whale]]s]]\n[[File:Killerwhales jumping.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Orca]]s]]\n\nThe infraorder Cetacea includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s.

It is served by [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] and [[TransPennine Express]] services, plus [[Caledonian Sleeper]] overnight services between London and Scotland.\n\nThe [[North Union Railway]] opened a station on the site in 1838. It was extended in 1850, with new platforms under the separate management of the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], and by 1863 London&ndash;Scotland trains stopped here to allow passengers to eat in the station dining room. The current station was built in 1880 and extended in 1903 and 1913, when it had fifteen platforms. A free buffet for servicemen was provided during both World Wars. The East Lancashire platforms were demolished in the 1970s as connecting lines closed. Only six platforms remain in regular use today.\n\nAs well as intercity trains to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Glasgow Central Station|Glasgow Central]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]], the station is served by local trains to other parts of Lancashire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Yorkshire.\n\n==Station layout and amenities==\nThe main entrance to the station is at the bottom of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office is located within the small [[concourse]]. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are [[footbridge]]s on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative entrance to the station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station [[car park]]. There is also a [[Subway (underpass)|subway]] which provides step-free access to all but one platforms in use at the station and another entrance serving the station car park at the south end of platform 7.\n\nThe island forming platforms 3 and 4 is a very wide island platform with a long series of buildings. Inside these buildings are services and amenities including a [[newsagent]] and several food outlets including a licensed [[restaurant]]. There are also toilets and a large waiting room. A small travel centre on platform 3, near the ramp, is operated by [[Avanti West Coast]] staff to give information for passengers on the platform.

This importance continued into the railway age, both as a major junction and as a stopping point about halfway between London and [[Glasgow]].<ref>Lawrence, p.136</ref>\n\n===Preston's railways===\nThe first rail lines in Preston were those of the [[Lancaster Canal Tramroad]], a horse-drawn line connecting two parts of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. It opened in 1805, but never carried passengers and never converted to steam. It ceased operating in Preston<!--but a part continued to operate outside Preston--> in 1862.<ref name=\"GH97_98\">Greville & Holt 1, pp.97&ndash;98</ref>\n\nThe first steam-hauled passenger railway in Preston was the [[North Union Railway]] (NUR). On 31 October 1838 it opened its line from [[Wigan]] to a station on the site of the present-day Preston Station.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.95</ref> This immediately linked the town to London, [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]].\n\nEach subsequent line was built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a single station, by which time all the companies had been taken over by one or both of just two companies.\n\nThe second passenger railway into Preston was the [[Preston and Longridge Railway]], which opened as another horse-drawn tramway on 1 May 1840, to a terminus in {{stnlnk|Deepdale Street}}.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.198</ref> It converted to steam in 1848, but did not run its trains into the North Union station until 1885.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.200\u2013201</ref>\n\n[[File:Euxton, Farington & Preston RJD 62.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Railways around Preston in 1913]]\n[[File:PRESTON PALS MEMORIAL AT PRESTON STATION OCT 2013 (10123073945).jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial tablet to the [[Preston Pals]] at Preston railway station, who departed here for war in 1914]]\nThe [[Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway]] (L&PJR) was the third line, which opened on 25 June 1840,<ref name=\"GH96\">Greville & Holt 1, p.96</ref> initially using the North Union station. However, relations between the NUR and L&PJR soured, and, from 1 January 1842, most L&PJR trains used, instead, Maxwell House railway station, a short distance to the north of the North Union station. A few trains passed through, but the NUR charged a toll of 6[[penny|d]] per passenger. Most passengers refused to pay, preferring to alight at Maxwell House and walk the {{convert|200|yd|-2}} to the North Union station, but the NUR refused to hold the train to allow passengers to walk and rebook. The NUR advised northbound passengers to travel by the [[Lancaster Canal]] rather than the L&PJR.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/> On 1 January 1844, Maxwell House station came into the possession of the NUR, and lack of agreement led to several weeks when hapless L&PJR passengers had to alight on the trackside at nearby Dock Street (off Pitt Street). Lancaster trains were able to use the North Union station from 12 February.<ref name=\"GH99\">Greville & Holt 1, p.99</ref>\n\nPreston's fourth railway was the [[Preston and Wyre Joint Railway]] to [[Fleetwood]], opening, just a few weeks after the L&PJR, on 16 July 1840, to its own terminus at {{stnlnk|Maudlands}} in Leighton Street.<ref name=\"GH96\"/> After 12 February 1844, regular Preston and Wyre trains used the North Union station, along with the L&PJR, although Maudlands Station continued to be used for excursions for some decades.<ref name=\"GH99\"/>\n\nThe fifth company to run trains into Preston was the [[Bolton and Preston Railway]] (BPR), from 22 June 1843. Its line joined the North Union's at Euxton, {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} south of Preston, but the company used Maxwell House railway station instead of the North Union's. However, the NUR charged 1[[shilling|s]] per passenger to BPR trains over its tracks, and eventually the BPR resorted to ferrying its passengers by road between Euxton and Preston. The BPR was driven into submission and was taken over by the NUR from 1 January 1844.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/>\n\nThe sixth line into Preston was that of the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line immediately south of [[Farington railway station|Farrington Station]] (respelt \"Farington\" from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]] (ELR) on 3 August 1846.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, pp.99\u2013100</ref> Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] (which later became the dividing line between [[Avenham Park|Avenham]] and [[Miller Park, Preston|Miller]] Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built on the east side of the [[North Union Railway|North Union]] station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station.<ref name=\"GH101\">Greville & Holt 1, p.101</ref><ref name=\"S59\">Suggitt, p.59</ref> The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.<ref name=\"GH197\">Greville & Holt 2, p.197</ref>\n\nThe seventh line in Preston was the North Union's own [[Ribble Branch Line|Victoria Quay Branch]] to Victoria Quay on the [[River Ribble]] (later extended to Preston Docks in 1882 and which now connects to the heritage [[Ribble Steam Railway]]).<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.203</ref> The single-track goods line opened in October 1846 from a south-facing junction immediately south of Preston Station, through a tight curve into a tunnel with a gradient of 1 in 29, emerging north of Fishergate Hill near the riverside.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.100</ref>\n\nThe eighth line to Preston was the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]], owned by the ELR and connected to its [[Blackburn]] line into Preston. It opened on 2 April 1849.<ref name=\"GH197\"/> From 1891, its trains used a new curve at Farington to enter Preston via the North Union line.<ref name=\"S59\"/>\n\nThe ninth and final line into Preston was the [[West Lancashire Railway]] (WLR) from [[Southport Central railway station|Southport]]. The railway arrived in Preston on 16 September 1882, by which time all the town's other lines were owned by the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) or the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (LYR), or jointly by both. The independent WLR built its own [[Preston Fishergate Hill railway station|Fishergate Hill station]]. It also built a connecting line to the former ELR (then LYR) line, via which the majority of Southport-to-Preston trains continued to {{stnlnk|Blackburn}}. The railway was not a success, and on 1 July 1897 it was taken over by the LYR. This resulted in the diversion of all passenger services to use the East Lancashire platforms of Preston Station from 16 July 1900.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nThe network of lines south of Preston allowed great flexibility in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town on any of the lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective [[U-turn]], a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.\n\n===Station development===\n[[File:Preston railway station 1850.png|thumb|Layout of station until 1850]]\nWhen the station was first opened in 1838 by the [[North Union Railway]], the line north of the station passed through a tunnel under the west end of Fishergate (then Preston's major thoroughfare). It was on a slope so steep that sometimes station staff had to push trains out of the station.\nBy 1846, the station was already very busy, handling trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, pp.274&ndash;275</ref> North of the station was a network of goods lines around the end of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.\n\nThe station's first expansion came in 1850 when the new East Lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], with their own entrance and booking office in Butler Street.<ref name=\"GH101\"/> From 1863, trains between London and Scotland, having no dining cars, were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at Preston for passengers to eat in the station's dining room.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, p.277</ref> The pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about the same time.<ref>Lawrence, p.142</ref> The condition of the station deteriorated to the extent that on 18 August 1866 part of the roof on the East Lancashire side collapsed injuring three people, one seriously. By then, 150 trains a day passed through the station.<ref name=\"GH276\"/>\n\nEventually the station was rebuilt, at a cost of a quarter of a million pounds, reopening in July 1880, and with seven through platforms and four bay platforms. At this time, both the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] bridge and the line as far as Euxton, were widened from two tracks to four.<ref name=\"GH276\">Greville & Holt 3, p.276</ref><ref>Gairns, p.337</ref> A striking feature of the new station was its long and wide central [[island platform]], {{convert|1225|ft|m}} long and {{convert|110|ft|m}} wide. It was larger than any of the London terminal station platforms, the longest being [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross]] at {{convert|990|ft|m|0}}. Along the centre of the platform were refreshment rooms, offices, and waiting rooms. A booking hall at the north end of the station was accessed from the middle of a new bridge carrying Fishergate over the railway. A broad ramp led down to the main island platform, with footbridges to smaller platforms on either side. Further south, the platforms were also linked by a passenger subway and a separate subway for luggage, accessed via hoists.<ref>Lawrence, p.139</ref> At the south end of the main platform, a footbridge led to the nearby [[Park Hotel, Preston|Park Hotel]], a joint LYR/LNWR property, opened in 1883.<ref>Gairns, p.342</ref><ref>Suggitt, p.63</ref>\n\nOn 30 January 1877 a heavy storm blew the roof completely away from the station,<ref name=Times310177>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Gale. Meteorological Reports |date=31 January 1877 |page_number=6 |issue=28853 |column=D }}</ref> but a more serious accident occurred on 13 July 1896 when a {{stnlnk|Euston}} to [[Glasgow]] train passed through the station at an estimated {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|-1}}, despite a {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit. It was derailed on a tight curve at the north end of the station, killing one person.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref name=Lawrence140>Lawrence, p.140</ref> As a result of this, the tracks were realigned. Charles Street, to the west of the station, was demolished, as were more houses northwest of the station. Fishergate bridge was extended on its west side. This allowed more tracks and platforms to be built on the west side of the station, with gentler curves. The Ribble bridge was widened again, from four to six tracks. These enlargements were completed by 1903.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref>Lawrence, p.141</ref> The east side of the station was also extended in 1913.<ref>Rush, p.7</ref>\n\n[[File:Preston railway station 1926.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Layout of station in 1926]]\n\nBy 1926, the lines and platforms were used as follows, from west to east:\n\n* Southwest of the station was Christian Road Goods Station (previously known as Charles Street Goods Station before 1903).\n* Next was the single-track goods line that curved west to enter the tunnel to the docks.\n* North of the tunnel was a goods loading platform, added in 1903.\n* Then were two through lines for non-stop traffic, added in 1903.\n* Platforms 1 and 2 formed a large island platform, added in 1903, with station buildings, handling through traffic to and from [[Blackpool]]. Platform 2 was also used as a terminal platform for {{stnlnk|Longridge|England}} trains, and as a reversal platform for trains between {{stnlnk|Lancaster}} and Blackpool.\n* Between platforms 2 and 3 was a centre line used as a run-around loop.\n* Platforms 3 and 4 formed a narrow island platform without buildings. Platform 3 was used for terminal and reversal trains, as Platform 2. Platform 4 was a loop platform for Platform 5.\n* Platforms 5 and 6 formed the main, wide island platform, with a full set of buildings along its centre. The platforms were used mainly for [[West Coast Main Line]] services, northbound and southbound respectively. At the south end were two [[bay platform]]s, between platforms 5 and 6, used for short trains and goods vans.\n* Platforms 7 and 8 formed another narrow island platform, somewhat shorter than the other platforms. Platform 7 was a loop platform for Platform 6. Platform 8 was the northbound East Lancashire through platform.\n* Platform 9 was the main southbound East Lancashire through platform, containing more buildings and linked to the Butler Street station entrance.\n* Platform 10 was added in 1913, as another southbound East Lancashire through platform, which trains accessed via a short tunnel underneath a rebuilt Butler Street entrance.\n* Platform 11 was a bay platform, set back at the south end of Platform 9, and curving sharply to the east.\n* Platforms 12 and 13 were bay platforms, between Platforms 11 and 10, also curving east. All three bay platforms were for terminating services to and from Southport, Blackburn and Liverpool via Ormskirk. Platform 13 was added in 1913.\n* To the east of the station was Butler Street Goods Station, with a large number of sidings and two warehouses.<ref>Gairns, pp.342\u2013343</ref>\n\nLater{{When|date=September 2010}}, platforms 11, 12, 13 and 10 were renumbered into the more logical sequence 10, 11, 12, 13.\n<gallery>\nFile:Preston 2 railway station2064010 1b1bf58e.jpg|Southward view from the station in 1959\nFile:Preston 3 station with LMS Patriot 2094612 ef1db98c.jpg|A special runs northbound past old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 4 railway station 2105033 1057ff88.jpg|Blackpool express entering Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston 5 railway station 2107654 26e78e47.jpg|Glasgow express at old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 6 railway station 2109607 caf8224e.jpg|Two northbound expresses at Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston railway station 2057308 1d25ac1e.jpg|Windermere express at old platform 3 in 1963\nFile:Preston 9 railway station geograph-2202233.jpg|Station north end in 1963\nFile:Preston 8 railway station geograph-2199110.jpg|Old platforms 8, 7 and 6 from the footbridge in 1966\n</gallery>\n\n===Contraction===\n[[File:Preston 7 railway station 2039787 d579c3c3.jpg|thumb|The East Lancashire platforms and goods shed, pictured in 1959 from Vicar's Bridge.]]\n[[File:Preston Railway Station E Lancs platforms (cropped).jpg|thumb|Approximately the same location in 2007. A [[multi-storey car park]] has since been built over part of this area.]]\nA number of lines around Preston have closed, including the Longridge line in 1930<ref>Suggitt, p.52</ref><ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.201</ref> and the West Lancashire line in 1964.<ref>Suggitt, p.115</ref> The old island platforms one and two were closed in 1970 together with the goods lines to the west of the station, but it was then extended northwards to allow platform two to become a dedicated parcels platform. The line towards Liverpool was truncated and singled in summer 1970, with Preston services terminating at {{stnlnk|Ormskirk}}. This was followed by the closure of the East Lancashire line, between Preston and {{stnlnk|Bamber Bridge}}, via its original direct route, in April 1972. The East Lancashire platforms 10 to 13 were demolished, along with the Butler Street Goods Yard.<ref>Suggitt, p.60</ref> Their site is now covered by car parks for the station and the adjacent [[Fishergate Shopping Centre]], which was built in the 1980s, partly over the north end of the former goods yard. The remaining platforms 3 to 9 were renumbered 1 to 7.\n\nSome of the station's heritage can still be seen:\n* At the far north end of platform 4 are the remains of the Ladywell Sidings, most of which was swept away by the ring road built in the 1990s.\n* At the north end of platform 3, a disused bay platform can be seen. It follows the original alignment of the main platform before the 1903 expansion.\n* There is a tunnel between platforms 3 and 4, under the station approach. Locomotives and trains are occasionally stored there.\n* At the north of platform 7 is the blocked up remains of the tunnel which took the platform 13 (originally number 10) through-line from the north, under the Butler Street entrance.\n* At the southern end of platform 7, the platform edge curves away to the east but the line now turns westward to join the main line.\n* The former platforms 1 and 2 are also still in existence, but closed to passengers, and was used for Royal Mail Parcelforce services until recently. Old platform 1 and the lines to its west have been broken to form two bay platforms. Network Rail has its offices here.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn the early 1970s, approval was given to electrify the rest of the [[West Coast Main Line]] from Weaver Junction through Preston to Glasgow Central. This was accompanied by new signals on the line and a power signal box was constructed north of the station close by Fylde Junction. Electrification over run also took place at this junction. This was also to facilitate electrification to Blackpool at a later date.\n\n===Special features===\n[[File:Plaque at Preston Railway Station UK.jpg|thumb|Plaque on one of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 commemorating the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\">[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=584 Engineering Timelines: Carlisle (Lune) Bridge], accessed 10 January 2008</ref>]]\nA free buffet for servicemen was provided at the station during both World Wars. The [[Preston Station Free Buffet Association]] served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 hours a day for the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3&nbsp;million men between 1915 and 1919. 12&nbsp;million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945.<ref>Hunt, p.18</ref> It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north\u2013south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised ''[[Preston Passion]]'' of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).\n\nOne of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, and carries a small plaque detailing the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974, after the completion of electrification of tracks north of the point where it stands. This was significant because it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\"/>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 1 October 1831, some wagons ran away on an inclined plane, worked by a stationary steam engine, at [[Avenham]]brow.

It is served by [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] and [[TransPennine Express]] services, plus [[Caledonian Sleeper]] overnight services between London and Scotland.\n\nThe [[North Union Railway]] opened a station on the site in 1838. It was extended in 1850, with new platforms under the separate management of the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], and by 1863 London&ndash;Scotland trains stopped here to allow passengers to eat in the station dining room. The current station was built in 1880 and extended in 1903 and 1913, when it had fifteen platforms. A free buffet for servicemen was provided during both World Wars. The East Lancashire platforms were demolished in the 1970s as connecting lines closed. Only six platforms remain in regular use today.\n\nAs well as intercity trains to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Glasgow Central Station|Glasgow Central]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]], the station is served by local trains to other parts of Lancashire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Yorkshire.\n\n==Station layout and amenities==\nThe main entrance to the station is at the bottom of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office is located within the small [[concourse]]. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are [[footbridge]]s on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative entrance to the station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station [[car park]]. There is also a [[Subway (underpass)|subway]] which provides step-free access to all but one platforms in use at the station and another entrance serving the station car park at the south end of platform 7.\n\nThe island forming platforms 3 and 4 is a very wide island platform with a long series of buildings. Inside these buildings are services and amenities including a [[newsagent]] and several food outlets including a licensed [[restaurant]]. There are also toilets and a large waiting room. A small travel centre on platform 3, near the ramp, is operated by [[Avanti West Coast]] staff to give information for passengers on the platform. In addition to these main amenities, there is a small coffee shop outlet on platform 4, as well as an additional shop on platforms 1 and 2.\n\nPassenger information systems were updated during 2007 and now use [[dot matrix]] display screens. Preston retained a manual tannoy system until 30 January 2017, a rarity amongst the larger stations in the UK.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A new automated announcement system was introduced. In 2009 the station was identified as one of the ten worst [[United Kingdom railway station categories|category B]] interchange stations for mystery shopper assessment of fabric and environment, and was set to receive a share of \u00a350m funding for improvements prior to a public spending review initiated in 2010.<ref>{{cite news| title=\u00a350m revamp for 'worst stations' | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8363621.stm | date=17 November 2009 | accessdate=17 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.lep.co.uk/news/local/tracks-of-our-fears-1-776003 Tracks of our fears] Lancashire Evening Post</ref>\n\n==Services==\n[[File:Preston railway station 2008.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Layout of station in 2008]]\n[[File:Preston Station Platforms.jpg|thumb|The ramp to platforms 3 and 4]]\n[[File:Preston railway station.jpg|thumb|Platform 2 looking south]]\n[[File:Preston railway station - DSC03705.JPG|thumb|Platform 3 looking north]]\n[[File:6201 Princess Elizabeth in Preston.jpg|thumb|[[LMS Princess Royal Class 6201 Princess Elizabeth|6201 Princess Elizabeth]] waiting to depart Preston with an excursion train bound for [[Liverpool]].]]\n[[File:45562 Alberta ready to depart Preston.jpg|thumb|[[LMS Jubilee Class 5699 Galatea|45562 Alberta]] waiting to depart Preston in the early evening with a northbound excursion train bound for [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]].]]\nThere are currently six through and two [[bay platform]]s in use at Preston, with two more available for emergency use.

The most popular excursion train's are the ones which are worked by [[steam locomotive]]s. These trips vary from being either ones that start off at Preston and can be seen at the station for a while or briefly stop to pickup passengers before continuing it's journey. Steam locomotives that have been known to visit Preston in recent years include: [[LMS Princess Royal Class 6201 Princess Elizabeth|6201 Princess Elizabeth]], [[LMS Princess Coronation Class 6233 Duchess of Sutherland|6233 Duchess of Sutherland]], [[LMS Jubilee Class 5690 Leander|45690 Leander]], [[LMS Jubilee Class 5699 Galatea|45699 Galatea]], [[LMS Royal Scot Class 6115 Scots Guardsman|46115 Scots Guardsman]] & [[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|48151]].\n\nThe Cumbrian Mountain Express is a regular train which stops at Preston to pickup passengers while heading to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] over [[Shap|Shap Summit]]. These are known to run in both the summer and winter each year.\n\n====Future services====\n=====Grand Central=====\nIn June 2018, the [[Office of Rail & Road]] approved an application by [[Alliance Rail Holdings]] for five services per day from London Euston to Blackpool North that will call at Preston.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180910181020/http://www.alliancerail.co.uk/22-new-blackpool-to-london-rail-services-approved New Blackpool to London Services Approved] Alliance Rail Holdings 7 June 2018</ref> These will be operated by sister [[Arriva]] company [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]] commencing in 2021.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200408001253/https://www.grandcentralrail.com/news/2019/grand-central-plans-new-blackpool-london-route-2020-in-major-boost-for-local-economy Grand Central plans new Blackpool to London route from 2020 in major boost for the local economy] Grand Central 24 June 2019</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200408001552/https://www.grandcentralrail.com/news/2020/grand-central-announces-temporary-suspension-of-train-services-during-covid-19 Grand Central announces temporary suspension of train services during COVID-19 restrictions] Grand Central 3 April 2020</ref>\n\n=====Merseyrail=====\nLiverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, page 37, states a review in 2020 to introduce new [[Merseyrail]] battery trains will be undertaken, in view to put Preston onto the Merseyrail network by extending the Merseyrail [[Northern line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] from Ormskirk to Preston.

This importance continued into the railway age, both as a major junction and as a stopping point about halfway between London and [[Glasgow]].<ref>Lawrence, p.136</ref>\n\n===Preston's railways===\nThe first rail lines in Preston were those of the [[Lancaster Canal Tramroad]], a horse-drawn line connecting two parts of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. It opened in 1805, but never carried passengers and never converted to steam. It ceased operating in Preston<!--but a part continued to operate outside Preston--> in 1862.<ref name=\"GH97_98\">Greville & Holt 1, pp.97&ndash;98</ref>\n\nThe first steam-hauled passenger railway in Preston was the [[North Union Railway]] (NUR). On 31 October 1838 it opened its line from [[Wigan]] to a station on the site of the present-day Preston Station.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.95</ref> This immediately linked the town to London, [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]].\n\nEach subsequent line was built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a single station, by which time all the companies had been taken over by one or both of just two companies.\n\nThe second passenger railway into Preston was the [[Preston and Longridge Railway]], which opened as another horse-drawn tramway on 1 May 1840, to a terminus in {{stnlnk|Deepdale Street}}.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.198</ref> It converted to steam in 1848, but did not run its trains into the North Union station until 1885.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.200\u2013201</ref>\n\n[[File:Euxton, Farington & Preston RJD 62.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Railways around Preston in 1913]]\n[[File:PRESTON PALS MEMORIAL AT PRESTON STATION OCT 2013 (10123073945).jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial tablet to the [[Preston Pals]] at Preston railway station, who departed here for war in 1914]]\nThe [[Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway]] (L&PJR) was the third line, which opened on 25 June 1840,<ref name=\"GH96\">Greville & Holt 1, p.96</ref> initially using the North Union station. However, relations between the NUR and L&PJR soured, and, from 1 January 1842, most L&PJR trains used, instead, Maxwell House railway station, a short distance to the north of the North Union station. A few trains passed through, but the NUR charged a toll of 6[[penny|d]] per passenger. Most passengers refused to pay, preferring to alight at Maxwell House and walk the {{convert|200|yd|-2}} to the North Union station, but the NUR refused to hold the train to allow passengers to walk and rebook. The NUR advised northbound passengers to travel by the [[Lancaster Canal]] rather than the L&PJR.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/> On 1 January 1844, Maxwell House station came into the possession of the NUR, and lack of agreement led to several weeks when hapless L&PJR passengers had to alight on the trackside at nearby Dock Street (off Pitt Street). Lancaster trains were able to use the North Union station from 12 February.<ref name=\"GH99\">Greville & Holt 1, p.99</ref>\n\nPreston's fourth railway was the [[Preston and Wyre Joint Railway]] to [[Fleetwood]], opening, just a few weeks after the L&PJR, on 16 July 1840, to its own terminus at {{stnlnk|Maudlands}} in Leighton Street.<ref name=\"GH96\"/> After 12 February 1844, regular Preston and Wyre trains used the North Union station, along with the L&PJR, although Maudlands Station continued to be used for excursions for some decades.<ref name=\"GH99\"/>\n\nThe fifth company to run trains into Preston was the [[Bolton and Preston Railway]] (BPR), from 22 June 1843. Its line joined the North Union's at Euxton, {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} south of Preston, but the company used Maxwell House railway station instead of the North Union's. However, the NUR charged 1[[shilling|s]] per passenger to BPR trains over its tracks, and eventually the BPR resorted to ferrying its passengers by road between Euxton and Preston. The BPR was driven into submission and was taken over by the NUR from 1 January 1844.<ref name=\"GH97_98\"/>\n\nThe sixth line into Preston was that of the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line immediately south of [[Farington railway station|Farrington Station]] (respelt \"Farington\" from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]] (ELR) on 3 August 1846.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, pp.99\u2013100</ref> Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] (which later became the dividing line between [[Avenham Park|Avenham]] and [[Miller Park, Preston|Miller]] Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built on the east side of the [[North Union Railway|North Union]] station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station.<ref name=\"GH101\">Greville & Holt 1, p.101</ref><ref name=\"S59\">Suggitt, p.59</ref> The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.<ref name=\"GH197\">Greville & Holt 2, p.197</ref>\n\nThe seventh line in Preston was the North Union's own [[Ribble Branch Line|Victoria Quay Branch]] to Victoria Quay on the [[River Ribble]] (later extended to Preston Docks in 1882 and which now connects to the heritage [[Ribble Steam Railway]]).<ref>Greville & Holt 2, p.203</ref> The single-track goods line opened in October 1846 from a south-facing junction immediately south of Preston Station, through a tight curve into a tunnel with a gradient of 1 in 29, emerging north of Fishergate Hill near the riverside.<ref>Greville & Holt 1, p.100</ref>\n\nThe eighth line to Preston was the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]], owned by the ELR and connected to its [[Blackburn]] line into Preston. It opened on 2 April 1849.<ref name=\"GH197\"/> From 1891, its trains used a new curve at Farington to enter Preston via the North Union line.<ref name=\"S59\"/>\n\nThe ninth and final line into Preston was the [[West Lancashire Railway]] (WLR) from [[Southport Central railway station|Southport]]. The railway arrived in Preston on 16 September 1882, by which time all the town's other lines were owned by the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) or the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (LYR), or jointly by both. The independent WLR built its own [[Preston Fishergate Hill railway station|Fishergate Hill station]]. It also built a connecting line to the former ELR (then LYR) line, via which the majority of Southport-to-Preston trains continued to {{stnlnk|Blackburn}}. The railway was not a success, and on 1 July 1897 it was taken over by the LYR. This resulted in the diversion of all passenger services to use the East Lancashire platforms of Preston Station from 16 July 1900.<ref>Greville & Holt 2, pp.201\u2013202</ref>\n\nThe network of lines south of Preston allowed great flexibility in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town on any of the lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective [[U-turn]], a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.\n\n===Station development===\n[[File:Preston railway station 1850.png|thumb|Layout of station until 1850]]\nWhen the station was first opened in 1838 by the [[North Union Railway]], the line north of the station passed through a tunnel under the west end of Fishergate (then Preston's major thoroughfare). It was on a slope so steep that sometimes station staff had to push trains out of the station.\nBy 1846, the station was already very busy, handling trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, pp.274&ndash;275</ref> North of the station was a network of goods lines around the end of the [[Lancaster Canal]]. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.\n\nThe station's first expansion came in 1850 when the new East Lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]], with their own entrance and booking office in Butler Street.<ref name=\"GH101\"/> From 1863, trains between London and Scotland, having no dining cars, were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at Preston for passengers to eat in the station's dining room.<ref>Greville & Holt 3, p.277</ref> The pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about the same time.<ref>Lawrence, p.142</ref> The condition of the station deteriorated to the extent that on 18 August 1866 part of the roof on the East Lancashire side collapsed injuring three people, one seriously. By then, 150 trains a day passed through the station.<ref name=\"GH276\"/>\n\nEventually the station was rebuilt, at a cost of a quarter of a million pounds, reopening in July 1880, and with seven through platforms and four bay platforms. At this time, both the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] bridge and the line as far as Euxton, were widened from two tracks to four.<ref name=\"GH276\">Greville & Holt 3, p.276</ref><ref>Gairns, p.337</ref> A striking feature of the new station was its long and wide central [[island platform]], {{convert|1225|ft|m}} long and {{convert|110|ft|m}} wide. It was larger than any of the London terminal station platforms, the longest being [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross]] at {{convert|990|ft|m|0}}. Along the centre of the platform were refreshment rooms, offices, and waiting rooms. A booking hall at the north end of the station was accessed from the middle of a new bridge carrying Fishergate over the railway. A broad ramp led down to the main island platform, with footbridges to smaller platforms on either side. Further south, the platforms were also linked by a passenger subway and a separate subway for luggage, accessed via hoists.<ref>Lawrence, p.139</ref> At the south end of the main platform, a footbridge led to the nearby [[Park Hotel, Preston|Park Hotel]], a joint LYR/LNWR property, opened in 1883.<ref>Gairns, p.342</ref><ref>Suggitt, p.63</ref>\n\nOn 30 January 1877 a heavy storm blew the roof completely away from the station,<ref name=Times310177>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Gale. Meteorological Reports |date=31 January 1877 |page_number=6 |issue=28853 |column=D }}</ref> but a more serious accident occurred on 13 July 1896 when a {{stnlnk|Euston}} to [[Glasgow]] train passed through the station at an estimated {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|-1}}, despite a {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit. It was derailed on a tight curve at the north end of the station, killing one person.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref name=Lawrence140>Lawrence, p.140</ref> As a result of this, the tracks were realigned. Charles Street, to the west of the station, was demolished, as were more houses northwest of the station. Fishergate bridge was extended on its west side. This allowed more tracks and platforms to be built on the west side of the station, with gentler curves. The Ribble bridge was widened again, from four to six tracks. These enlargements were completed by 1903.<ref name=\"GH276\"/><ref>Lawrence, p.141</ref> The east side of the station was also extended in 1913.<ref>Rush, p.7</ref>\n\n[[File:Preston railway station 1926.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Layout of station in 1926]]\n\nBy 1926, the lines and platforms were used as follows, from west to east:\n\n* Southwest of the station was Christian Road Goods Station (previously known as Charles Street Goods Station before 1903).\n* Next was the single-track goods line that curved west to enter the tunnel to the docks.\n* North of the tunnel was a goods loading platform, added in 1903.\n* Then were two through lines for non-stop traffic, added in 1903.\n* Platforms 1 and 2 formed a large island platform, added in 1903, with station buildings, handling through traffic to and from [[Blackpool]]. Platform 2 was also used as a terminal platform for {{stnlnk|Longridge|England}} trains, and as a reversal platform for trains between {{stnlnk|Lancaster}} and Blackpool.\n* Between platforms 2 and 3 was a centre line used as a run-around loop.\n* Platforms 3 and 4 formed a narrow island platform without buildings. Platform 3 was used for terminal and reversal trains, as Platform 2. Platform 4 was a loop platform for Platform 5.\n* Platforms 5 and 6 formed the main, wide island platform, with a full set of buildings along its centre. The platforms were used mainly for [[West Coast Main Line]] services, northbound and southbound respectively. At the south end were two [[bay platform]]s, between platforms 5 and 6, used for short trains and goods vans.\n* Platforms 7 and 8 formed another narrow island platform, somewhat shorter than the other platforms. Platform 7 was a loop platform for Platform 6. Platform 8 was the northbound East Lancashire through platform.\n* Platform 9 was the main southbound East Lancashire through platform, containing more buildings and linked to the Butler Street station entrance.\n* Platform 10 was added in 1913, as another southbound East Lancashire through platform, which trains accessed via a short tunnel underneath a rebuilt Butler Street entrance.\n* Platform 11 was a bay platform, set back at the south end of Platform 9, and curving sharply to the east.\n* Platforms 12 and 13 were bay platforms, between Platforms 11 and 10, also curving east. All three bay platforms were for terminating services to and from Southport, Blackburn and Liverpool via Ormskirk. Platform 13 was added in 1913.\n* To the east of the station was Butler Street Goods Station, with a large number of sidings and two warehouses.<ref>Gairns, pp.342\u2013343</ref>\n\nLater{{When|date=September 2010}}, platforms 11, 12, 13 and 10 were renumbered into the more logical sequence 10, 11, 12, 13.\n<gallery>\nFile:Preston 2 railway station2064010 1b1bf58e.jpg|Southward view from the station in 1959\nFile:Preston 3 station with LMS Patriot 2094612 ef1db98c.jpg|A special runs northbound past old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 4 railway station 2105033 1057ff88.jpg|Blackpool express entering Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston 5 railway station 2107654 26e78e47.jpg|Glasgow express at old platform 5 in 1962\nFile:Preston 6 railway station 2109607 caf8224e.jpg|Two northbound expresses at Preston in 1962\nFile:Preston railway station 2057308 1d25ac1e.jpg|Windermere express at old platform 3 in 1963\nFile:Preston 9 railway station geograph-2202233.jpg|Station north end in 1963\nFile:Preston 8 railway station geograph-2199110.jpg|Old platforms 8, 7 and 6 from the footbridge in 1966\n</gallery>\n\n===Contraction===\n[[File:Preston 7 railway station 2039787 d579c3c3.jpg|thumb|The East Lancashire platforms and goods shed, pictured in 1959 from Vicar's Bridge.]]\n[[File:Preston Railway Station E Lancs platforms (cropped).jpg|thumb|Approximately the same location in 2007.

This was followed by the closure of the East Lancashire line, between Preston and {{stnlnk|Bamber Bridge}}, via its original direct route, in April 1972. The East Lancashire platforms 10 to 13 were demolished, along with the Butler Street Goods Yard.<ref>Suggitt, p.60</ref> Their site is now covered by car parks for the station and the adjacent [[Fishergate Shopping Centre]], which was built in the 1980s, partly over the north end of the former goods yard. The remaining platforms 3 to 9 were renumbered 1 to 7.\n\nSome of the station's heritage can still be seen:\n* At the far north end of platform 4 are the remains of the Ladywell Sidings, most of which was swept away by the ring road built in the 1990s.\n* At the north end of platform 3, a disused bay platform can be seen. It follows the original alignment of the main platform before the 1903 expansion.\n* There is a tunnel between platforms 3 and 4, under the station approach. Locomotives and trains are occasionally stored there.\n* At the north of platform 7 is the blocked up remains of the tunnel which took the platform 13 (originally number 10) through-line from the north, under the Butler Street entrance.\n* At the southern end of platform 7, the platform edge curves away to the east but the line now turns westward to join the main line.\n* The former platforms 1 and 2 are also still in existence, but closed to passengers, and was used for Royal Mail Parcelforce services until recently. Old platform 1 and the lines to its west have been broken to form two bay platforms. Network Rail has its offices here.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn the early 1970s, approval was given to electrify the rest of the [[West Coast Main Line]] from Weaver Junction through Preston to Glasgow Central. This was accompanied by new signals on the line and a power signal box was constructed north of the station close by Fylde Junction. Electrification over run also took place at this junction. This was also to facilitate electrification to Blackpool at a later date.\n\n===Special features===\n[[File:Plaque at Preston Railway Station UK.jpg|thumb|Plaque on one of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 commemorating the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\">[http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=584 Engineering Timelines: Carlisle (Lune) Bridge], accessed 10 January 2008</ref>]]\nA free buffet for servicemen was provided at the station during both World Wars. The [[Preston Station Free Buffet Association]] served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 hours a day for the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3&nbsp;million men between 1915 and 1919. 12&nbsp;million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945.<ref>Hunt, p.18</ref> It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north\u2013south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised ''[[Preston Passion]]'' of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).\n\nOne of the [[overhead lines|catenary]] [[stanchion]]s on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, and carries a small plaque detailing the visit of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 7 May 1974, after the completion of electrification of tracks north of the point where it stands. This was significant because it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.<ref name=\"Eng Timelines 1\"/>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 1 October 1831, some wagons ran away on an inclined plane, worked by a stationary steam engine, at [[Avenham]]brow.
