It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted at number-one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling studio album of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift was set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, in 2020, but postponed to 2021 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need To Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. ''Lover'' appeared on several year-end best music lists of 2019, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] naming it the number-one best album of 2019. \n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 25, several news outlets reported that a [[mural]] of a butterfly in [[The Gulch, Nashville, Tennessee|The Gulch]] neighborhood of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], painted by street artist Kelsey Montague,<ref name=\"Tennessean\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/04/25/taylor-swift-announcement-2019-nashville-gulch-mural/3572564002/|title=Is Taylor Swift's announcement linked to activity in Nashville's Gulch?

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", ''Lover'' celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. Breaking a string of records, all 18 tracks of ''Lover'' charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release, including the fourth single \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" that peaked at number 23. ''Lover'' received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and growth; however, a few of them found the album lengthy and inconsistent.  \n\n''Lover'' debuted at number-one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US; it was the best selling album of 2019 in the country.

{"title_page": "Software patent", "text_new": "{{short description|Patent that covers a computer program}}\n{{Computer programs, software and patent law}}\n{{Patent law}}\n\nA '''software patent''' is a [[patent]] on a piece of [[software]], such as a [[computer program]], [[Library (computing)|libraries]], [[user interface]], or [[algorithm]].\n\n==Background==\nA patent is a set of exclusionary rights granted by a [[State (polity)|state]] to a patent holder for a limited period of time, usually 20 years. These rights are granted to patent applicants in exchange for their disclosure of the inventions. Once a patent is granted in a given country, no person may make, use, sell or import/export the claimed invention in that country without the permission of the patent holder. Permission, where granted, is typically in the form of a [[license]] which conditions are set by the patent owner: it may be free or in return for a royalty payment or lump sum fee.\n\nPatents are territorial in nature. To obtain a patent, inventors must file [[patent application]]s in each and every country in which they want a patent. For example, separate applications must be filed in [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[United States]] and [[India]] if the applicant wishes to obtain patents in those countries. However, some regional offices exist, such as the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), which act as supranational bodies with the power to grant patents which can then be brought into effect in the member states, and an international procedure also exists for filing a single international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), which can then give rise to patent protection in most countries.\n\nThese different countries and regional offices have different standards for granting patents. This is particularly true of software or computer-implemented inventions, especially where the software is implementing a business method.\n\n==Early example of a software patent==\nOn 21 May 1962, a British patent application entitled \"''A Computer Arranged for the Automatic Solution of [[linear programming|Linear Programming]] Problems''\" was filed.<ref name=\"BP-patent\">{{cite patent|GB|1039141}}</ref> The invention was concerned with [[Out-of-core algorithm|efficient memory management]] for the [[simplex algorithm]], and could be implemented by purely software means. The patent was granted on August 17, 1966 and seems to be one of the first software patents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beresford|first=K|year=2000|title=Patenting Software under the European Patent Convention|location=London|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|page=4}}<br/>{{cite journal|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2003_1/kretschmer/|title=Software as Text and Machine: The Legal Capture of Digital Innovation|first=Martin|last=Kretschmer|journal=Journal of Information Law & Technology (JILT)|place=Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management, Bournemouth University|date=4 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdictions==\nMost countries place some limits on the patenting of inventions involving software, but there is no one legal definition of a software patent. For example, U.S. patent law excludes \"abstract ideas\", and this has been used to refuse some patents involving software. In Europe, \"computer programs as such\" are excluded from patentability, thus [[European Patent Office]] policy is consequently that a program for a computer is not patentable if it does not have the potential to cause a \"technical effect\" which is by now understood as a material effect (a \"transformation of nature\").<ref>{{cite book|title=Technique et droit des brevets.

The same Full Federal Court in another decision regarding the patentability of an invention regarding a method  and system for assessing an individual\u2019s competency in relation to certain criterion, reiterated that a business method or mere scheme were per se are not patentable.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|177|2015|litigants=Commissioner of Patents v RPL Central Pty Ltd |date=11 December 2015 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nIn principle, computer software is still a valid patentable subject matter in Australia. But, in circumstances where patents have been sought over software to merely implement abstract ideas or business methods, the courts and the Commissioner of Patents have resisted granting patent protection to such applications both as a matter of statutory interpretation and policy.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Software patents under Canadian patent law}}\nIn [[Canada]], courts have held that the use of a computer alone neither lends, nor reduces patentability of an invention. However, it is the position of the Canadian Patent Office that where a computer is an \"essential element\" of a patent's claims, the claimed invention is generally patentable subject matter.<ref>{{citation|title=Examination Practice Respecting Computer-Implemented Inventions \u2013 PN 2013-03|url=http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr03627.html|publisher=Canadian Intellectual Property Office|date=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== China ===\nIn China, the starting time of software patent is relatively late. Because before 2006, software patents were basically not granted, and software and hardware had to be combined with applying for a patent. With the development of network technology and software technology, China's patent examination system has been constantly updated. Recently, the design idea of the software itself has been allowed to apply for patent separately, instead of requiring to be combined with hardware. However, software patent writing requirements are relatively high.\n\nSoftware patents can be written as either a product or a method, depending on the standards of review. However, no matter what form it is written in, it is difficult to highlight the creativity of the scheme, which requires specific case analysis.\n\nSoftware that can be patented mainly includes (but is not limited to) :\n\n(1) industrial control software, such as controlling the movement of mechanical equipment;\n\n(2) software to improve the internal performance of the computer, such as a software can improve the virtual memory of the computer;\n\n(3) external technical data processing software, such as digital camera image processing software.\n\nIt is fair to say that a considerable proportion of software belongs to category (3).\n\nThe patent protection measures can be seen in the patent law and the regulations on the protection of computer software.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}\nWithin European Union member states, the EPO and other national patent offices have issued many patents for inventions involving software since the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) came into force in the late 1970s. {{EPC Article|52}} excludes \"programs for computers\" from patentability (Art. 52(2)) to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program \"as such\" (Art. 52(3)). This has been interpreted to mean that any invention that makes a non-obvious \"technical contribution\" or solves a \"technical problem\" in a non-obvious way is patentable even if that technical problem is solved by running a computer program.<ref name=\"t0469/03\">{{citation|title=DECISION of 24 February 2006, Case Number: T 0469/03 \u2013 3.5.01|pages=Reasons 5.1 to 5.3|publisher=European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal|date=24 February 2006|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t030469eu1.html}}</ref>\n\nComputer-implemented inventions that ''only'' solve a business problem using a computer, rather than a technical problem, are considered unpatentable as lacking an inventive step (see [[T 258/03]]). Nevertheless, the fact that an invention is useful in business does not mean it is not patentable if it also solves a technical problem.\n\nA summary of the developments concerning patentability of computer programs under the European Patent Convention is given in (see [[G 3/08]]) as a response of the Enlarged Board of Appeal to questions filed by the President of the European Patent Office according to Art. 112(1)b) EPC.\n\nConcerns have been raised that the new (2015) [[Unified Patent Court]] will be much more open to patents generally and software patents in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://endsoftpatents.org/pages/unitary-patent/|title=End Software Patents}}<br/>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/europes-unitary-patent.en.html|title=Europe's \"unitary patent\" could mean unlimited software patents}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://en.swpat.org/wiki/EU_unitary_patent_and_Unified_Patent_Court|title=EU unitary patent and Unified Patent Court}}</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn April 2013, the [[German Parliament]] adopted a joint motion \"against the growing trend of patent offices to grant patents on software programs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2013/04/22/german-parliament-sends-message-stop-granting-software-patents|title=German Parliament Sends Message: Stop Granting Software Patents|last1=Ermert|first1=Monika|date=22 April 2013|work=Intellectual Property Watch|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{Main|Software patents under United Kingdom patent law}}\nUnited Kingdom patent law is interpreted to have the same effect as the [[European Patent Convention]] such that \"programs for computers\" are excluded from patentability to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program \"as such\". Current case law in the UK states that an (alleged) invention will only be regarded as an invention if it provides a contribution that is not excluded and that is also technical.

Dr. Tangkitvanich, the IT specialist of Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), raised his concern that Thailand is not in a good stage for a software patent as there were several flaws in patent rights. For example, the business method prevention has high tendency to hinder the growth in innovations especially for the infant software companies.<ref>Newsbytes, Thailand Mulls Software Patent Rules, at http: //www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/technology/ (last visited Jul. 25, 2000).</ref> Moreover, the software patent may cause monopoly and innovation problems. \u201cMonopoly will thwart innovations of new software products, particularly open-source software\u201d, said by a group of Thai Economists. However, Dr. Hirapruk who is the Director of Software Park Thailand, on the other hand, \u00a0provides his support on allowing the computer programs to be patentable: \u201cThailand had to provide a patent-right protection for computer software to ensure foreign high-tech investors that software producers' creativity would be secured from violations in Thailand\u201d. As a result, Mr. Sribhibhadh, president of the Association of Thai Software Industry, emphasized that there will need to be a clear overview of the impact on the local industry if Thailand really had to fully implement the patent right protections.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Software patents2.JPG|thumb|left|Growth of software patents in US]]\n{{Main|Software patents under United States patent law}}\nThe [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] has granted patents that may be referred to as software patents since at least the early 1970s.<ref>{{US patent|3552738}}, {{US patent|3553358}} and {{US patent|3553384}} granted 5 January 1971, and {{US patent|3996564}} granted December 7, 1976 can be easily found using the [[Bessen/Hunt technique]].

We do not so hold.\"<ref>Gottschalk v Benson, {{ussc|409|63|1972}}</ref> In 1981, the Supreme Court stated that \"a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer\" and a [[Claim (patent)|claim]] is patentable if it contains \"a mathematical formula [and] implements or applies the formula in a structure or process which, when considered as a whole, is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect\".<ref>Diamond v. Diehr, {{ussc|450|175|1981}}</ref>\n\nDue to different treatment of federal patent rights in different parts of the country, in 1982 the U.S. Congress created a new court (the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]]) to hear patent cases. Following several landmark decisions by this court, by the early 1990s the patentability of software was well established, and in 1996 the USPTO issued Final Computer Related Examination Guidelines stating that \"A ''practical application'' of a computer-related invention is statutory subject matter. This requirement can be discerned from the variously phrased prohibitions against the patenting of abstract ideas, laws of nature or natural phenomena\" (emphasis added).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/og/con/files/cons093.htm|title=Examination Guidelines for Computer-Related Inventions|publisher=United States Patent Office|date=1996-03-26|accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nThe recent expansion of the [[Internet]] and [[e-commerce]] has led to many patents being applied for and being granted for business methods implemented in software and the question of whether [[business method patent|business methods]] are statutory subject matter is a separate issue from the question of whether software is.

Furthermore, it can be executed in the medium of a new process or product or a developmental enhancement in a product or process. According to Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 7 of Patent Law in Indonesia.,<ref name=\":1\" /> an application can not be patented as an invention if the product or process contradicts or challenges the current regulations and rules, public order or ethics, and religious morality. In addition, if the application is treated as a method or theory in the scientific or mathematics, argued to be any type of living creatures, with the exception of micro-organisms, or is considered as an essential biological measure to produce plants or animals, the application is not a patentable invention.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs software contains algorithms, it is deemed to be part of the field of mathematics; hence, software cannot be protected by patents in Indonesia. However, one way for the Indonesian Intellectual Property office to grant software patents in Indonesia is if the application has been patented in other nations, which have ratified the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|Patent Corporation Treaty]] (PCT). Therefore, in accordance to the regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, a software will have a regional protection among the participating entities of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.co.id/uploads/4/0/0/2/40023645/pct_regulations.pdf|title=Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty|last=|first=|date=|website=WIPO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAn important update was enacted on 26 August 2016, the Law No. 13 Year 2016, Patent Law in Indonesia.<ref name=\":0\" /> This update is geared to encourage innovation and growth by augmenting the number of patents within the public and private sector in Indonesia. This update proposes an extension of protection for simple patent, which grants application for patents for new improvements or inventions to existing processes. Intangible inventions can also be patented; under the former law, simple patent is restricted for tangible inventions, which has a positive implication for software patents in Indonesia. Furthermore, these changes provide more protection to the pharmaceutical industry and encourage public access to medical knowledge. This can boost new software ideas and processes within the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector. This update provides a stronger protection of traditional knowledge. In addition, a significant update is the usability of electronic filling and electronic media. Under this new law, application can be made electronically.\n\n==Purpose of patents==\n{{Main|Patentable subject matter}}\nFor the U.S., the purpose of patents is laid down in the constitutional clause that gives Congress the power \"[t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;\" (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8). For Europe, there is no similar definition. Commonly four patent justification theories are recognised, as laid down for instance by Machlup in 1958,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/etexts/patentsystem.pdf|title=An Economic Review of the Patent System (1958)|date=|accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> which include justice to the inventor and benefit for society by rewarding inventors. Disclosure is required in return for the exclusive right, and disclosure may promote further development. However, the value of disclosure should not be overestimated: some inventions could not be kept secret otherwise, and patents also prohibit independent reinventions to be exploited.\n\nThere is [[Software patent debate|debate]] as to whether or not these aims are achieved with software patents.\n\n==Proposals==\nIn seeking to find a balance, different countries have different policies as to where the boundary between patentable and non-patentable software should lie. In Europe, a number of different proposals for setting a boundary line were put forward during the debate concerning the proposed [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]], none of which were found acceptable by the various parties to the debate. Two particular suggestions for a hurdle that software must pass to be patentable include:\n\n* A computer program that utilises \"controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results\".<ref>{{citation|title=Amendment 23 to the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|date=September 2003|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210231145/http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|archivedate=February 10, 2006}}<br/>{{citation|title=Dispositions program decision|publisher=[[Bundesgerichtshof]] (, BGH, Federal Court of Justice of Germany)|date=1976-06-22}}</ref>\n* A computer program which provides a \"technical effect\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t930059eu1.htm|work=Decision T 0059/93 () of 20 April 1994|date=20 April 1994|publisher=[[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal]]|title=Reasons, point 3.4}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, [[Ben Klemens]], a Guest Scholar at the [[Brookings Institution]], proposed that patents should be granted only to inventions that include a physical component that is by itself nonobvious.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=25 March 2006|page=A9|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114325217495908172|title=The Gravity of the U.S. Patent Swindle}}</ref> This is based on Justice [[William Rehnquist]]'s ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court case of [[Diamond v.

Upholding an \"insignificant postsolution activity\" rule as per Justice [[Rehnquist]]'s ruling would also eliminate most [[business method patent]]s.\n\n==Obviousness==\nA common objection to software patents is that they relate to trivial inventions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/20/comment.comment|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Patent absurdity|date=June 20, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2010|first=Richard|last=Stallman}}</ref> A patent on an invention that many people would easily develop independently of one another should not, it is argued, be granted since this impedes development.\n\nDifferent countries have different ways of dealing with the question of [[inventive step and non-obviousness]] in relation to software patents. Europe uses an 'Inventive step test'; see the [[Inventive step under the European Patent Convention|Inventive step requirement in Europe]] and, for instance, [[T 258/03]].\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Compatibility===\nThere are a number of high-profile examples where the patenting of a data exchange standards forced another programming group to introduce an alternative format. For instance, the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) format was largely introduced to avoid the [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) patent problems, and [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]] to avoid [[MP3]]. If it is discovered that these new suggested formats are themselves covered by existing patents, the final result may be a large number of incompatible formats.

As of 2015, approximately 500,000 patents had issued in the 23 classes of patents covering \"computer implemented inventions\" (see table).\n\nMany software companies [[cross-licensing|cross license]] their patents to each other. These agreements allow each party to practice the other party's patented inventions without the threat of being sued for [[patent infringement]]. [[Microsoft]], for example, has agreements with [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] (now [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Siemens]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Autodesk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arn.idg.com.au/index.php?taxid=620938001&id=63439861 |title=Microsoft, Autodesk in patent licensing deal |work=IDG News Service |date=2004-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222332/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/5043/microsoft_autodesk_patent_licensing_deal/?taxid=620938001 |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> and recently [[Novell]]. Microsoft cross-licensed its patents with Sun, despite being direct competitors, and with Autodesk even though Autodesk has far fewer patents than Microsoft.\n\nThe ability to negotiate cross licensing agreements is a major reason that many software companies, including those providing [[Open-source software|open source]] software, file patents. As of June 2006, for example, [[Red Hat]] had developed a [[patent portfolio|portfolio]] of 10 issued US patents, 1 issued European patent, 163 pending US patent applications, and 33 pending international PCT ([[Patent Cooperation Treaty]]) patent applications. Red Hat uses this portfolio to cross license with proprietary software companies so that they can preserve their freedom to operate.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nOther patent holders are in the business of inventing new \"computer implemented inventions\" and then commercializing the inventions by licensing the patents to other companies that manufacture the inventions. [[Walker Digital]], for example, has generated a large patent portfolio from its research efforts, including the basic patent on the [[Priceline.com]] reverse auction technology. US universities also fall into this class of patent owners. They collectively generate about $1.4 billion per year through licensing the inventions they develop to both established and start up companies in all fields of technology, including software.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.autm.net/FY_2004_Licensing_Survey/8932.htm|title=FY 2004 U.S. Licensing Survey|publisher=Association of University Technology Managers|date=2012-09-08}}</ref>\n\nStill other patent holders focus on obtaining patents from original inventors and licensing them to companies that have introduced commercial products into the marketplace after the patents were filed. Some of these patent holders, such as [[Intellectual Ventures]], are privately held companies financed by large corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, [[Intel]], [[Google]], etc. Others, such as [[Acacia Research|Acacia Technologies]], are publicly traded companies with institutional investors being the primary shareholders.<ref>{{citation|url=http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/co/overview.xhtml?ID=fffrfkrhrrxhjcxxkh|title=Acacia Technologies LLC: Company Information|publisher=Hoovers}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of acquiring patents merely to license them is controversial in the software industry. Companies that have this business model are pejoratively referred to as [[patent troll]]s. It is an integral part of the business model that patent licensing companies sue infringers that do not take a license. Furthermore, they may take advantage of the fact that many companies will pay a modest license fee (e.g. $100,000 to $1,000,000) for rights to a patent of questionable validity, rather than pay the high legal fees ($2,000,000 or more) to demonstrate in court that the patent is invalid.{{Citation needed|reason=What are median license fees and litigation costs?

'''software patent''' is a [[patent]] on a piece of [[software]], such as a [[computer program]], [[Library (computing)|libraries]], [[user interface]], or [[algorithm]].\n\n==Background==\nA patent is a set of exclusionary rights granted by a [[State (polity)|state]] to a patent holder for a limited period of time, usually 20 years. These rights are granted to patent applicants in exchange for their disclosure of the inventions. Once a patent is granted in a given country, no person may make, use, sell or import/export the claimed invention in that country without the permission of the patent holder. Permission, where granted, is typically in the form of a [[license]] which conditions are set by the patent owner: it may be free or in return for a royalty payment or lump sum fee.\n\nPatents are territorial in nature. To obtain a patent, inventors must file [[patent application]]s in each and every country in which they want a patent. For example, separate applications must be filed in [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[United States]] and [[India]] if the applicant wishes to obtain patents in those countries. However, some regional offices exist, such as the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), which act as supranational bodies with the power to grant patents which can then be brought into effect in the member states, and an international procedure also exists for filing a single international application under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]] (PCT), which can then give rise to patent protection in most countries.\n\nThese different countries and regional offices have different standards for granting patents. This is particularly true of software or computer-implemented inventions, especially where the software is implementing a business method.\n\n==Early example of a software patent==\nOn 21 May 1962, a British patent application entitled \"''A Computer Arranged for the Automatic Solution of [[linear programming|Linear Programming]] Problems''\" was filed.<ref name=\"BP-patent\">{{cite patent|GB|1039141}}</ref> The invention was concerned with [[Out-of-core algorithm|efficient memory management]] for the [[simplex algorithm]], and could be implemented by purely software means. The patent was granted on August 17, 1966 and seems to be one of the first software patents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beresford|first=K|year=2000|title=Patenting Software under the European Patent Convention|location=London|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|page=4}}<br/>{{cite journal|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/2003_1/kretschmer/|title=Software as Text and Machine: The Legal Capture of Digital Innovation|first=Martin|last=Kretschmer|journal=Journal of Information Law & Technology (JILT)|place=Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management, Bournemouth University|date=4 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdictions==\nMost countries place some limits on the patenting of inventions involving software, but there is no one legal definition of a software patent. For example, U.S. patent law excludes \"abstract ideas\", and this has been used to refuse some patents involving software. In Europe, \"computer programs as such\" are excluded from patentability, thus [[European Patent Office]] policy is consequently that a program for a computer is not patentable if it does not have the potential to cause a \"technical effect\" which is by now understood as a material effect (a \"transformation of nature\").<ref>{{cite book|title=Technique et droit des brevets.

The subject matter of an invention is patentable in Australia, if it is a ''manner of manufacture'' within the meaning of section 6 of the [[Statute of Monopolies]].<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|/pa1990109|Patents Act 1990|18}} Patentable inventions</ref> The High Court of Australia has refrained from ruling on the precise definition of manner of manufacture stating that any such attempt is bound to fail for the policy reason of encouraging national development in fields that may be unpredictable.<ref name=\"102 CLR 252\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|67|1959|litigants=National Research Development Corp v Commissioner of Patents |parallelcite=(1959) 102 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 252 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In assessing whether an invention is a manner of manufacture, the High Court has relied on the inquiry of whether  the subject of the claims defining the invention has as its end result an ''artificially created state of affairs''.<ref name=\"102 CLR 252\"/>\n\nIn a decision of the Federal Court of Australia, on the patentability of an improved method of representing curved images in computer graphics displays, it was held that the application of selected mathematical methods to computers may involve steps which are foreign to the normal use of computers and hence amount to a manner of manufacture.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCA|811|1991|parallelcite=105 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 388 |litigants=International Business Machines Corp v Commissioner of Patents |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In another unanimous decision by the Full Federal Court of Australia, an invention for methods of storing and retrieving Chinese characters to perform word processing was held to be an artificially created state of affairs and consequently within the concept of a manner of manufacture.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCA|396|1994|parallelcite=(1994) 51 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 260 |litigants=CCOM Pty Ltd v Jie-jing Pty Ltd |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] |juris=Australia}}.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, in a recent decision on the patentability of a computer implemented method of generating an index based on selection and weighing of data based on certain criterion, the Full Federal Court of Australia reaffirmed that mere methods, schemes and plans are not manners of manufacture.<ref name=\"austlii.edu.au\">{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|150|2014|litigants=Research Affiliates LLC v Commissioner of Patents |date=10 November 2014 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> The Full Court went on to hold that the use of a computer to implement a scheme did not contribute to the invention or the artificial effect of the invention.<ref name=\"austlii.edu.au\"/> The subject matter of the invention was held to be an abstract idea and not a manner of manufacture within the meaning of the term in the Patents Act. The same Full Federal Court in another decision regarding the patentability of an invention regarding a method  and system for assessing an individual\u2019s competency in relation to certain criterion, reiterated that a business method or mere scheme were per se are not patentable.<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|177|2015|litigants=Commissioner of Patents v RPL Central Pty Ltd |date=11 December 2015 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nIn principle, computer software is still a valid patentable subject matter in Australia. But, in circumstances where patents have been sought over software to merely implement abstract ideas or business methods, the courts and the Commissioner of Patents have resisted granting patent protection to such applications both as a matter of statutory interpretation and policy.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Software patents under Canadian patent law}}\nIn [[Canada]], courts have held that the use of a computer alone neither lends, nor reduces patentability of an invention. However, it is the position of the Canadian Patent Office that where a computer is an \"essential element\" of a patent's claims, the claimed invention is generally patentable subject matter.<ref>{{citation|title=Examination Practice Respecting Computer-Implemented Inventions \u2013 PN 2013-03|url=http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/wr03627.html|publisher=Canadian Intellectual Property Office|date=March 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== China ===\nIn China, the starting time of software patent is relatively late. Because before 2006, software patents were basically not granted, and software and hardware had to be combined with applying for a patent. With the development of network technology and software technology, China's patent examination system has been constantly updated. Recently, the design idea of the software itself has been allowed to apply for patent separately, instead of requiring to be combined with hardware. However, software patent writing requirements are relatively high.\n\nSoftware patents can be written as either a product or a method, depending on the standards of review. However, no matter what form it is written in, it is difficult to highlight the creativity of the scheme, which requires specific case analysis.\n\nSoftware that can be patented mainly includes (but is not limited to) :\n\n(1) industrial control software, such as controlling the movement of mechanical equipment;\n\n(2) software to improve the internal performance of the computer, such as a software can improve the virtual memory of the computer;\n\n(3) external technical data processing software, such as digital camera image processing software.\n\nIt is fair to say that a considerable proportion of software belongs to category (3).\n\nThe patent protection measures can be seen in the patent law and the regulations on the protection of computer software.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}\nWithin European Union member states, the EPO and other national patent offices have issued many patents for inventions involving software since the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) came into force in the late 1970s. {{EPC Article|52}} excludes \"programs for computers\" from patentability (Art. 52(2)) to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program \"as such\" (Art. 52(3)). This has been interpreted to mean that any invention that makes a non-obvious \"technical contribution\" or solves a \"technical problem\" in a non-obvious way is patentable even if that technical problem is solved by running a computer program.<ref name=\"t0469/03\">{{citation|title=DECISION of 24 February 2006, Case Number: T 0469/03 \u2013 3.5.01|pages=Reasons 5.1 to 5.3|publisher=European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal|date=24 February 2006|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t030469eu1.html}}</ref>\n\nComputer-implemented inventions that ''only'' solve a business problem using a computer, rather than a technical problem, are considered unpatentable as lacking an inventive step (see [[T 258/03]]). Nevertheless, the fact that an invention is useful in business does not mean it is not patentable if it also solves a technical problem.\n\nA summary of the developments concerning patentability of computer programs under the European Patent Convention is given in (see [[G 3/08]]) as a response of the Enlarged Board of Appeal to questions filed by the President of the European Patent Office according to Art. 112(1)b) EPC.\n\nConcerns have been raised that the new (2015) [[Unified Patent Court]] will be much more open to patents generally and software patents in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://endsoftpatents.org/pages/unitary-patent/|title=End Software Patents}}<br/>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/europes-unitary-patent.en.html|title=Europe's \"unitary patent\" could mean unlimited software patents}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://en.swpat.org/wiki/EU_unitary_patent_and_Unified_Patent_Court|title=EU unitary patent and Unified Patent Court}}</ref>\n\n====Germany====\nIn April 2013, the [[German Parliament]] adopted a joint motion \"against the growing trend of patent offices to grant patents on software programs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2013/04/22/german-parliament-sends-message-stop-granting-software-patents|title=German Parliament Sends Message: Stop Granting Software Patents|last1=Ermert|first1=Monika|date=22 April 2013|work=Intellectual Property Watch|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{Main|Software patents under United Kingdom patent law}}\nUnited Kingdom patent law is interpreted to have the same effect as the [[European Patent Convention]] such that \"programs for computers\" are excluded from patentability to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program \"as such\". Current case law in the UK states that an (alleged) invention will only be regarded as an invention if it provides a contribution that is not excluded and that is also technical. A computer program implementing a business process is therefore not an invention, but a computer program implementing an industrial process may well be.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], a clause to include software patents was quashed by the [[Indian Parliament]] in April 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/software-patents-under-ordinance-face-reversal/82155|title=Software patents under Ordinance face reversal|publisher=Financialexpress.com|date=2005-03-29|accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> However, following publication of the new guidelines on the examination of computer-related inventions on 19 February 2016, the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade marks accepts applications for software patents, as long as the software is claimed in conjunction with a novel hardware.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/34244396/Software_Patents_and_the_Internet_of_Things_in_Europe_the_United_States_and_India_FULL_TEXT_|title=Software Patents and the Internet of Things in Europe, the United States and India (FULL TEXT)|first=PhD|last=Guido Noto La Diega|via=www.academia.edu}}</ref> On 30 June 2017, revised guidelines on the examination of computer related inventions were published. This 2017 guidelines provides clarity on patentability of software invention in India, ie., the claimed computer-related invention needs to be ascertained whether it is of a technical nature involving technical advancement as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both, and is not subject to exclusion under Section 3 of the Patents Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipindia.nic.in/writereaddata/Portal/Images/pdf/Revised__Guidelines_for_Examination_of_Computer-related_Inventions_CRI__.pdf|title=Guidelines for Examination of Computer Related Inventions (CRIs)}}</ref>\nIn 2019, the Court observed,\n\u201cIn today\u2019s digital world, when most inventions are based on computer programs, it would be retrograde to argue that all such inventions would not be patentable. Innovation in the field of artificial intelligence, blockchain technologies and other digital products would be based on computer programs, however the same would not become nonpatentable inventions \u2013 simply for that reason. It is rare to see a product which is not based on a computer program. Whether they are cars and other automobiles, microwave ovens, washing machines, refrigerators, they all have some sort of computer programs in-built in them. Thus, the effect that such programs produce including in digital and electronic products is crucial in determining the test of patentability.\u201d \nPatent applications in these fields would have to be examined to see if they result in a \u201ctechnical contribution\u201d, it added.\nFurther elaborating on the usage of the term \u2018per se\u2019 in Section 3(k), the Court said,\n\u201cThe words \u2018per se\u2019 were incorporated so as to ensure that genuine inventions which are developed, based on computer programs are not refused patents.\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aditi |first1=Singh |title=A computer program which makes 'technical contribution' patentable, not hit by Sec 3(k) of Patents Act |url=https://www.barandbench.com/news/a-computer-program-which-makes-technical-contribution-patentable-not-hit-by-sec-3k-of-patents-act |accessdate=13 February 2020 |agency=Bar and Bench |date=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nSoftware-related inventions are patentable.

Dr. Tangkitvanich, the IT specialist of Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), raised his concern that Thailand is not in a good stage for a software patent as there were several flaws in patent rights. For example, the business method prevention has high tendency to hinder the growth in innovations especially for the infant software companies.<ref>Newsbytes, Thailand Mulls Software Patent Rules, at http: //www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/technology/ (last visited Jul. 25, 2000).</ref> Moreover, the software patent may cause monopoly and innovation problems. \u201cMonopoly will thwart innovations of new software products, particularly open-source software\u201d, said by a group of Thai Economists. However, Dr. Hirapruk who is the Director of Software Park Thailand, on the other hand, \u00a0provides his support on allowing the computer programs to be patentable: \u201cThailand had to provide a patent-right protection for computer software to ensure foreign high-tech investors that software producers' creativity would be secured from violations in Thailand\u201d. As a result, Mr. Sribhibhadh, president of the Association of Thai Software Industry, emphasized that there will need to be a clear overview of the impact on the local industry if Thailand really had to fully implement the patent right protections.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Software patents2.JPG|thumb|left|Growth of software patents in US]]\n{{Main|Software patents under United States patent law}}\nThe [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] has granted patents that may be referred to as software patents since at least the early 1970s.<ref>{{US patent|3552738}}, {{US patent|3553358}} and {{US patent|3553384}} granted 5 January 1971, and {{US patent|3996564}} granted December 7, 1976 can be easily found using the [[Bessen/Hunt technique]].

We do not so hold.\"<ref>Gottschalk v Benson, {{ussc|409|63|1972}}</ref> In 1981, the Supreme Court stated that \"a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer\" and a [[Claim (patent)|claim]] is patentable if it contains \"a mathematical formula [and] implements or applies the formula in a structure or process which, when considered as a whole, is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect\".<ref>Diamond v. Diehr, {{ussc|450|175|1981}}</ref>\n\nDue to different treatment of federal patent rights in different parts of the country, in 1982 the U.S. Congress created a new court (the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]]) to hear patent cases. Following several landmark decisions by this court, by the early 1990s the patentability of software was well established, and in 1996 the USPTO issued Final Computer Related Examination Guidelines stating that \"A ''practical application'' of a computer-related invention is statutory subject matter. This requirement can be discerned from the variously phrased prohibitions against the patenting of abstract ideas, laws of nature or natural phenomena\" (emphasis added).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/og/con/files/cons093.htm|title=Examination Guidelines for Computer-Related Inventions|publisher=United States Patent Office|date=1996-03-26|accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nThe recent expansion of the [[Internet]] and [[e-commerce]] has led to many patents being applied for and being granted for business methods implemented in software and the question of whether [[business method patent|business methods]] are statutory subject matter is a separate issue from the question of whether software is.  Critics of the Federal Circuit believe that the non-obviousness standard is partly responsible for the large increase in patents for software and business methods.<ref>Bessen, James, and Michael J.

Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008</ref> There have been several successful enforcement trials in the United States, some of which are listed in the [[list of software patents]] article.\n\nAn issue with software patent intellectual property rights is typically revolved around deciding whether the company or inventor owns it.\n\nAs a matter of law, in the United States, the employee generally owns the IP right unless the employee\u2019s inventing skills or task to create the invention is the main specific hiring reason or a specific clause in the employment agreement assigning invention rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.business.qld.gov.au/|title=Home|last=Employment|first=Small Business and Training|date=2010-12-03|website=www.business.qld.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adlilaw.com/who-owns-the-rights-to-a-patent-the-employer-or-inventor/|title=Who owns the rights to a patent?

Under Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 1 of Patent Law in Indonesia,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/id/id044en.pdf|title=Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 14 Year 2001|last=|first=|date=|website=WIPO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> application is considered as an invention if the activity is created to solve a particular conflict or problem in the technology sector. Furthermore, it can be executed in the medium of a new process or product or a developmental enhancement in a product or process. According to Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 7 of Patent Law in Indonesia.,<ref name=\":1\" /> an application can not be patented as an invention if the product or process contradicts or challenges the current regulations and rules, public order or ethics, and religious morality. In addition, if the application is treated as a method or theory in the scientific or mathematics, argued to be any type of living creatures, with the exception of micro-organisms, or is considered as an essential biological measure to produce plants or animals, the application is not a patentable invention.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs software contains algorithms, it is deemed to be part of the field of mathematics; hence, software cannot be protected by patents in Indonesia. However, one way for the Indonesian Intellectual Property office to grant software patents in Indonesia is if the application has been patented in other nations, which have ratified the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty|Patent Corporation Treaty]] (PCT). Therefore, in accordance to the regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, a software will have a regional protection among the participating entities of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.co.id/uploads/4/0/0/2/40023645/pct_regulations.pdf|title=Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty|last=|first=|date=|website=WIPO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAn important update was enacted on 26 August 2016, the Law No. 13 Year 2016, Patent Law in Indonesia.<ref name=\":0\" /> This update is geared to encourage innovation and growth by augmenting the number of patents within the public and private sector in Indonesia. This update proposes an extension of protection for simple patent, which grants application for patents for new improvements or inventions to existing processes. Intangible inventions can also be patented; under the former law, simple patent is restricted for tangible inventions, which has a positive implication for software patents in Indonesia. Furthermore, these changes provide more protection to the pharmaceutical industry and encourage public access to medical knowledge. This can boost new software ideas and processes within the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector. This update provides a stronger protection of traditional knowledge. In addition, a significant update is the usability of electronic filling and electronic media. Under this new law, application can be made electronically.\n\n==Purpose of patents==\n{{Main|Patentable subject matter}}\nFor the U.S., the purpose of patents is laid down in the constitutional clause that gives Congress the power \"[t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;\" (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8). For Europe, there is no similar definition. Commonly four patent justification theories are recognised, as laid down for instance by Machlup in 1958,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/etexts/patentsystem.pdf|title=An Economic Review of the Patent System (1958)|date=|accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> which include justice to the inventor and benefit for society by rewarding inventors. Disclosure is required in return for the exclusive right, and disclosure may promote further development. However, the value of disclosure should not be overestimated: some inventions could not be kept secret otherwise, and patents also prohibit independent reinventions to be exploited.\n\nThere is [[Software patent debate|debate]] as to whether or not these aims are achieved with software patents.\n\n==Proposals==\nIn seeking to find a balance, different countries have different policies as to where the boundary between patentable and non-patentable software should lie. In Europe, a number of different proposals for setting a boundary line were put forward during the debate concerning the proposed [[Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]], none of which were found acceptable by the various parties to the debate. Two particular suggestions for a hurdle that software must pass to be patentable include:\n\n* A computer program that utilises \"controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results\".<ref>{{citation|title=Amendment 23 to the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|date=September 2003|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210231145/http://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/itre/20030219/488498en.pdf|archivedate=February 10, 2006}}<br/>{{citation|title=Dispositions program decision|publisher=[[Bundesgerichtshof]] (, BGH, Federal Court of Justice of Germany)|date=1976-06-22}}</ref>\n* A computer program which provides a \"technical effect\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t930059eu1.htm|work=Decision T 0059/93 () of 20 April 1994|date=20 April 1994|publisher=[[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal]]|title=Reasons, point 3.4}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, [[Ben Klemens]], a Guest Scholar at the [[Brookings Institution]], proposed that patents should be granted only to inventions that include a physical component that is by itself nonobvious.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=25 March 2006|page=A9|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114325217495908172|title=The Gravity of the U.S. Patent Swindle}}</ref> This is based on Justice [[William Rehnquist]]'s ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court case of [[Diamond v.

Upholding an \"insignificant postsolution activity\" rule as per Justice [[Rehnquist]]'s ruling would also eliminate most [[business method patent]]s.\n\n==Obviousness==\nA common objection to software patents is that they relate to trivial inventions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/20/comment.comment|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Patent absurdity|date=June 20, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2010|first=Richard|last=Stallman}}</ref> A patent on an invention that many people would easily develop independently of one another should not, it is argued, be granted since this impedes development.\n\nDifferent countries have different ways of dealing with the question of [[inventive step and non-obviousness]] in relation to software patents. Europe uses an 'Inventive step test'; see the [[Inventive step under the European Patent Convention|Inventive step requirement in Europe]] and, for instance, [[T 258/03]].\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Compatibility===\nThere are a number of high-profile examples where the patenting of a data exchange standards forced another programming group to introduce an alternative format. For instance, the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) format was largely introduced to avoid the [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) patent problems, and [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]] to avoid [[MP3]]. If it is discovered that these new suggested formats are themselves covered by existing patents, the final result may be a large number of incompatible formats. Creating such formats and supporting them costs money and creates inconvenience to users.\n\n===Computer-implemented invention (CII)===\n{{Main|Software patents under the European Patent Convention}}\nUnder the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC), and in particular its Article 52,<ref>{{EPC Article|52}}</ref> \"[[computer programs|programs for computers]]\" are not regarded as inventions for the purpose of granting European patents,<ref>{{EPC Article|52|1}}</ref> but this exclusion from patentability only applies to the extent to which a European patent application or European patent relates to a computer program as such.<ref>{{EPC Article|52|3}}</ref> As a result of this partial exclusion, and despite the fact that the EPO subjects patent applications in this field to a much stricter scrutiny<ref name=LaubThesis>{{cite thesis|url=http://www.miplc.de/research/master_theses/2004_2005/abstracts/abstract_laub.pdf|first=Christoph|last=Laub|title=International Software Patent Filing: The Problem of Statutory Subject Matter in view of Legal Standards at the EPO-USPTO and Economic Implications|year=2005|origyear=Academic Year 2004/2005|type=Master's|publisher=Munich Intellectual Property Law Center |accessdate=21 March 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621083254/http://www.miplc.de/research/master_theses/2004_2005/abstracts/abstract_laub.pdf|archivedate=June 21, 2007}}</ref> when compared to their [[USPTO|American counterpart]], that does not mean that all [[invention]]s including some [[software]] are ''[[de jure]]'' not [[patentability|patentable]].\n\n===Overlap with copyright===\n{{See also|Software copyright|Copyright infringement of software}}\nPatent and copyright protection constitute two different means of legal protection which may cover the same subject matter, such as computer programs, since each of these two means of protection serves its own purpose.<ref>{{citation|work=Decision [[T 1173/97]] (Computer program product/IBM) of 1.7.1998|publisher=European Patent Office, Boards of Appeal|date=1 July 1998|title=Reasons 2.4|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t971173ex1.htm}}</ref> Software is protected as works of literature under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. This allows the creator to prevent another entity from copying the program and there is generally no need to register code in order for it to be copyrighted.\n\nPatents, on the other hand, give their owners the right to prevent others from using the technology defined by the patent claims, even if the technology was independently developed and there was no copying of a software or software code involved. In fact, one of the most recent EPO decisions<ref>{{citation|title=Decision T 0424/03 (Clipboard formats I/MICROSOFT) of 23.2.2006|publisher=European Patent Office Boards of Appeal|date=23 February 2006|url=http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t030424eu1.htm}}</ref> clarifies the distinction, stating that software is patentable, because it is basically only a technical method executed on a computer, which is to be distinguished from the program itself for executing the method, the program being merely an expression of the method, and thus being copyrighted.\n\nPatents cover the underlying methodologies embodied in a given piece of software, or the function that the software is intended to serve, independent of the particular language or code that the software is written in. Copyright prevents the direct copying of some or all of a particular version of a given piece of software, but does not prevent other authors from writing their own embodiments of the underlying methodologies. Assuming a dataset meets certain criteria, copyright can also be used to prevent a given set of data from being copied while still allowing the author to keep the contents of said set of data a [[trade secret]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/733688/Trade+Secrets/Copyright+in+Data+Compilations+Is+Thin|title=Copyright in Data Compilations is Thin|last=Bro|first=Sarah|date=September 6, 2018|work=Mondaq Business Briefing|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhether and how the [[Numerus clausus#Law|numerus clausus principle]] shall apply to the legal hybrid software<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|title=Copyrightable functions and patentable speech|journal=Communications of the ACM|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|volume=44|issue=2|date=February 2001|pages=69\u201375|doi=10.1145/359205.359231}}</ref> to provide a judicious balance between property rights of the title holders and freedom rights of computing professionals<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kiesewetter-K\u00f6binger|first=Swen|year=2010|title=Programmers' Capital|journal=Computer|volume=43|issue=2|pages=106\u2013108|doi=10.1109/MC.2010.47}}</ref> and society as a whole,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/patent_policy/en/scp_14/scp_14_7.pdf|title=Proposal from Brazil in respect of exceptions and limitations to patent rights|author=Standing Committee on the Law of Patents|date=January 20, 2010|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref> is in dispute.<ref>{{citation|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/comp/replies/planck_en.pdf|title=Stellungnahme zum Sondierungspapier der Kommission der Europaischen Gemeinschaften: Die Patentierbarkeit Computer-implementierter Erfindungen|trans-title=Opinion on the consultation paper by the Commission of the European Communities: The patentability of computer-implemented inventions|author=Max-Planck-Institut|date=20 December 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.buchhandel.de/WebApi1/GetMmo.asp?MmoId=4804929&mmoType=PDF|first=Marcus|last=Hoffmann|title=Mehrfachschutz geistigen Eigentums im deutschen Rechtssystem|trans-title=Multiple protection of intellectual property in the German legal system|year=2008|isbn=978-3-8316-0806-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Alexander|last=Peukert|title=G\u00fcterzuordnung als Rechtsprinzip|trans-title=Goods classification as a legal principle|year=2008|isbn=978-3-16-149724-7|publisher=Mohr Siebeck}}</ref>\n\n===Debate===\n\nThere is a [[software patent debate|debate]] over the extent to which software patents should be granted, if at all.

[[Microsoft]], for example, has agreements with [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] (now [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Siemens]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Autodesk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arn.idg.com.au/index.php?taxid=620938001&id=63439861 |title=Microsoft, Autodesk in patent licensing deal |work=IDG News Service |date=2004-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222332/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/5043/microsoft_autodesk_patent_licensing_deal/?taxid=620938001 |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> and recently [[Novell]]. Microsoft cross-licensed its patents with Sun, despite being direct competitors, and with Autodesk even though Autodesk has far fewer patents than Microsoft.\n\nThe ability to negotiate cross licensing agreements is a major reason that many software companies, including those providing [[Open-source software|open source]] software, file patents. As of June 2006, for example, [[Red Hat]] had developed a [[patent portfolio|portfolio]] of 10 issued US patents, 1 issued European patent, 163 pending US patent applications, and 33 pending international PCT ([[Patent Cooperation Treaty]]) patent applications. Red Hat uses this portfolio to cross license with proprietary software companies so that they can preserve their freedom to operate.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nOther patent holders are in the business of inventing new \"computer implemented inventions\" and then commercializing the inventions by licensing the patents to other companies that manufacture the inventions. [[Walker Digital]], for example, has generated a large patent portfolio from its research efforts, including the basic patent on the [[Priceline.com]] reverse auction technology. US universities also fall into this class of patent owners. They collectively generate about $1.4 billion per year through licensing the inventions they develop to both established and start up companies in all fields of technology, including software.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.autm.net/FY_2004_Licensing_Survey/8932.htm|title=FY 2004 U.S. Licensing Survey|publisher=Association of University Technology Managers|date=2012-09-08}}</ref>\n\nStill other patent holders focus on obtaining patents from original inventors and licensing them to companies that have introduced commercial products into the marketplace after the patents were filed. Some of these patent holders, such as [[Intellectual Ventures]], are privately held companies financed by large corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, [[Intel]], [[Google]], etc. Others, such as [[Acacia Research|Acacia Technologies]], are publicly traded companies with institutional investors being the primary shareholders.<ref>{{citation|url=http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/co/overview.xhtml?ID=fffrfkrhrrxhjcxxkh|title=Acacia Technologies LLC: Company Information|publisher=Hoovers}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of acquiring patents merely to license them is controversial in the software industry. Companies that have this business model are pejoratively referred to as [[patent troll]]s. It is an integral part of the business model that patent licensing companies sue infringers that do not take a license. Furthermore, they may take advantage of the fact that many companies will pay a modest license fee (e.g. $100,000 to $1,000,000) for rights to a patent of questionable validity, rather than pay the high legal fees ($2,000,000 or more) to demonstrate in court that the patent is invalid.{{Citation needed|reason=What are median license fees and litigation costs?

These systems use either  electromagnetic or ultrasonic sensors.\n\n==Ultrasonic systems==\n[[File:VW Golf VII - Parking sensor 02.jpg|thumb|Parking sensor on a fender]]\nThese systems feature [[Ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] [[proximity detector]]s to measure the distances to nearby objects via sensors located in the front and/or rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper fascias]] or visually minimized within adjacent grills or recesses.\n\nThe sensors emit acoustic pulses, with a control unit measuring the return interval of each reflected signal and calculating object distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.launch-techs.com/Support/Info/Benz-PTS.htm|title=Mercedes Benz Parktronic system (PTS)|accessdate=2008-07-13|publisher=Launch Tech}}</ref> The system in turns warns the driver with acoustic tones, the [[frequency]] indicating object distance, with faster tones indicating closer proximity and a continuous tone indicating a minimal pre-defined distance. Systems may also include visual aids, such as LED or LCD readouts to indicate object distance.  A vehicle may include a vehicle pictogram on the car's infotainment screen, with a representation of the nearby objects as coloured blocks.\n\nRear sensors may be activated when reverse gear is selected and deactivated as soon as any other gear is selected. Front sensors may be activated manually and deactivated automatically when the vehicle reaches a pre-determined speed \u2014 to avoid subsequent nuisance warnings.\n\nAs an ultrasonic systems relies on the reflection of sound waves, the system may not detect flat objects or object insufficiently large to reflect sound \u2014 e.g., a narrow pole or a longitudinal object pointed directly at the vehicle or near an object. Objects with flat surfaces angled from the vertical may deflect return sound waves away from the sensors, hindering detection. Also soft object with strong sound absorption  may have weaker detection, e.g. wool or moss.\n\nThe Parking Sensor, originally called as ReverseAid, was a spin-off from the Sonic Pathfinder,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gateway to Perceptual Alternatives| url=http://www.sonicpathfinder.org|website=Perceptual Alternatives}}</ref> an Electronic Guidance Device for the Blind.  Both devices were invented in the late 1970s by [http://sonicpathfinder.org/pa/cv.html Tony Heyes] while working at the Blind Mobility Research Unit at Nottingham University in the UK.  After patenting the device in 1983 Heyes offered it to Jaguar Cars in Coventry.  After test driving the prototype on Heyes's car they very politely told him that, \"You like it because you are a one-eyed driver who cannot judge distances.  Real people would not want a thing like this.\"{{cn|date=October 2017}}\n\nHeyes teamed up with a local manufacturer and some 150 units were made and fitted to petrol tankers, trucks and delivery vehicles.  Very few were fitted to private cars since few people wanted to drill holes into their cars.\n\n==Electromagnetic systems==\n\nThe electromagnetic parking sensor (EPS) was re-invented and patented in 1992 by Mauro Del Signore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&CC=IT&NR=1256863B|title=Electromagnetic Parking Sensor patent}}</ref> Electromagnetic sensors rely on the vehicle moving slowly and smoothly towards the object to be avoided. Once detected, the obstacle, if the vehicle momentarily stops on its approach, the sensor continues to give signal of presence of the obstacle. If the vehicle then resumes its manoeuvre the alarm signal becomes more and more impressive as the obstacle approaches. Electromagnetic parking sensors are often sold as not requiring any holes to be drilled offering a unique design that discreetly mounts on the inner side of the bumper preserving the 'new factory look' of your vehicle.

The song was released on September 6, 2019 through [[Columbia Records]], as the fifth and final single from the band's eighth studio album ''[[Nine (Blink-182 album)|Nine]]''. It was released as a single two weeks before the album was released. It was written by bassist [[Mark Hoppus]], drummer [[Travis Barker]], and guitarist [[Matt Skiba]], as well as producers [[Andrew Watt (musician)|Andrew Watt]] and [[John Feldmann]], and songwriters [[Ali Tamposi]] and Nathan Perez.\n\nFor the band, it was regarded as the toughest song to develop while writing ''Nine''. It went through several iterations\u2014including one involving a collaboration with pop star [[Miley Cyrus]]\u2014before the trio settled on a version that suited them best.

It was captured by the [[British East India Company]] after victory in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the [[Maharaja of Mysore]]. The old city developed in the dominions of the [[Maharaja of Mysore]] and was made capital of the [[Princely State of Mysore]], which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the [[British Raj]].\n\nIn 1809, the British shifted their [[Bangalore Cantonment|cantonment]] to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of [[British India]].

On his debut studio album, ''Material Me'', he focused the production more towards a [[synth-pop]] driven style with elements of [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[rock (music)|rock]] and [[soul (music)|soul]]. His follow-up, ''[[Perfect Enemy (album)|Perfect Enemy]]'' (2015), consists of a more [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop (music)|pop]] sound, venturing away from synth-pop and [[dance-pop]]. His 2018 studio album, ''[[The Skeptic (album)|The Skeptic]]'' has been labeled as a [[pop rock]], pop and synth-pop record while exploring more aggressive elements of [[rock music|rock]] such as [[post-hardcore]] on the track \"Handsome Garbage\", and [[Electro (music)|electro]] on the songs \"Drunken Conversation\" and \"Let Her Go\".\n\nAs a member of [[Tides of Man]], the band pursued post-hardcore with elements of [[experimental rock]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[progressive rock]]. After leaving Tides of Man, he joined [[Dance Gavin Dance]], focussing on a more aggressive-style of post-hardcore and experimental rock, with influences of [[jazz-fusion|jazz]], [[funk rock]], [[math rock]], and [[emo (music)|emo]]. In a 2019 interview with ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', Pearson revealed that upon joining Dance Gavin Dance, his melodies and lyricism were both heavily inspired by his former band Tides of Man on ''[[Acceptance Speech 2.0|Acceptance Speech]]'' (2013), while claiming he cemented his style on ''[[Instant Gratification]]'' (2015).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgJuO4h787I&t=568s] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nTilian Pearson was born on July 7, 1987 in [[Clearwater, Florida]].

The original music score is composed by [[Steve Dorff]].  The film generated a total domestic gross of $13,110,903. It received a \"two thumbs up\" rating from [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel and Ebert]].\n\nThe film is an open parody of the [[beach party film]]s made popular in the 1960s, especially those in which Avalon and Funicello had appeared. The plot is merely the means of connecting the various sight gags, homages and in-jokes.  All character names are taken from those earlier films.\n\nThe film's soundtrack included covers of several well-known beach tunes, along with new songs by such artists as [[Aimee Mann]] and [[Private Domain (band)|Private Domain]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nFrankie Avalon and Annette Funicello are a husband and wife living in Ohio \u2014 far from the surf and sand of their earlier lives together. Frankie is a stressed out car salesman and former \"Big Kahuna\" of the surf scene in California while Annette bottles her own sense of angst up in a bevy of shopping. Together they are raising a son, Bobby, who is in the throes of rebellion against his seemingly square folks.\n\nOne day, the family decides to take a vacation to Hawaii. Deciding to stop in California to visit their daughter Sandi ([[Lori Loughlin]]), Frankie and Annette are appalled to learn that she has been making time with surfer Michael ([[Tommy Hinkley]]) throughout her time there. The family misses their flight to Hawaii, and ultimately end up staying in California, much to the chagrin of Frankie. Frankie and Annette get caught up with the lives of their old friends and their old beach, and thus their last beach adventure begins.\n\nAlong the way, Frankie must work together with a new generation of younger surfers while nearly ruining his marriage by dallying with [[Connie Stevens]] \u2014 one of several pop-culture icons appearing in the film, including [[Fishbone]], [[Don Adams]], [[Bob Denver]], [[Alan Hale Jr.]], [[Edd Byrnes]], [[Jerry Mathers]], [[Tony Dow]], [[Barbara Billingsley]], [[Dick Dale]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[O. J. Simpson]], and [[Pee-wee Herman]]. In the end ''The Big Kahuna'' overcomes his own fears and proves that he is still the king of the surfers, as he takes back his title and saves the beach from a gang of beach punks led by Zed (Joe Holland).\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\nThe soundtrack for this film was released in 1987 on CBS Records (CK-40892).
