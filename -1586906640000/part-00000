Styrofoam containers were phased out beginning in 1990, due to environmental concerns.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-02/news/mn-3711_1_foam-packages McDonald's to Do Away With Foam Packages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404131638/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-02/news/mn-3711_1_foam-packages |date=April 4, 2017 }}. Los Angeles Times. November 2, 1990. Retrieved 2017-04-03.</ref> The product is now sold in another collapsible cardboard box.\n\n== Advertising ==\nThe earliest instances of McDonald's using advertising for the burger were mainly print ads, and a TV ad in which [[Hoyt Axton]] sings \"The Ballad of Big Mac\" which aired in 1969.\n\n=== ''Two all-beef patties'' slogan ===\nThe ''Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions \u2013 on a sesame seed bun'' concept for the jingle was created by Keith Reinhard, Chairman Emeritus of [[DDB Worldwide]], and his creative group at [[DDB Worldwide|Needham Harper and Steers]]. Originally, the ingredients appeared as a one-word heading for a McDonald's ad developed for college newspapers. The words were then set to music created by Mark Vieha, who performed the original jingle. The first run of commercials ran only a year and a half, going off the air in 1976, but its popularity remained beyond its TV life. Subsequent to the jingle, McDonald's followed up with a promotion based on its customers spontaneously having a \"Big Mac Attack\".\n\nIn the United States during the original campaign many franchises ran promotions that awarded a free burger to customers who could recite the slogan within a specified time (usually two or three seconds). One example of its success was that the McDonald's operators in New York City ran out of Big Mac buns.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} McDonald's Australia emulated this promotion in the mid-1980s, and some Brazilian McDonald's around the same time (only offering a free glass of [[Coca-Cola]] instead), in the Portuguese-language version, which is \"Dois hamb\u00fargueres, alface, queijo, molho especial, cebola e picles num p\u00e3o com gergelim\".\n\nIn 2003, McDonald's revived the phrase. In an English-language ad from McDonald's international \"[[i'm lovin' it]]\" campaign, a [[rapper]] rapidly spouts off the trademark in the background music. Also in 2003, [[American Greetings]] and [[Carlton Cards]] released a [[Christmas ornament]] of a Big Mac, on which the slogan was both printed and played aloud by pulling on a string. Roy Bergold, National Advertising Manager at McDonald's, has a big hand in championing the original campaign and helping to bring it back.\n\nIn 2008 McDonald's Malaysia revived the phrase. The revival includes the original prize of a free Big Mac if the customer is able to recite the phrase in under four seconds. It was released in May, along with the promotional ''Mega Mac'', which has four beef patties instead of two.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n=== 1980s advertising ===\nIn the early 1980s, as a promotion, McDonald's staged an in-house rivalry between their two most popular products. Consumers were invited to decide \"Which one will be number one? [[Chicken McNuggets]] or Big Mac sandwiches?\" For each of either item that a customer bought, they received another of the same at half price. Later in the ad campaign, the second was offered for free. It was eventually announced that the Big Mac was \"number one\".\n\nAds in the 1980s and early 1990s featured the character [[Mac Tonight]] and a parody of the song [[Mack the Knife]]. The character was pulled after settlement of a lawsuit by the estate of late singer [[Bobby Darin]], whose famous 1958 recording popularized the song.\n\n=== 2005 advertising ===\nIn 2005, McDonald's began offering [[product placement]] rewards to [[hip hop]] artists who [[name-dropping|namechecked]] the Big Mac in their music, giving US$5 to the artist for every time a song mentioning the hamburger was played on the radio.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4389751.stm |title=Return of the Mac \u2013 coming soon<!-- Bot generated title --> |work=BBC News |date=March 29, 2005 |accessdate=March 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224150429/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4389751.stm |archive-date=December 24, 2005 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This offer quickly spawned a satirical reference from hip hop artist [[Mad Skillz]], who references the marketing ploy in his track \"2005 Wrap Up\" by stating \"And I'm beefin' wit' Mickey D's man, y'all dead wrong, Talkin' 'bout payin' rappers to mention Big Macs in their song, We do rap from the heart, y'all better have some respect, Alright, Big Mac!

Styrofoam containers were phased out beginning in 1990, due to environmental concerns.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-02/news/mn-3711_1_foam-packages McDonald's to Do Away With Foam Packages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404131638/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-02/news/mn-3711_1_foam-packages |date=April 4, 2017 }}. Los Angeles Times. November 2, 1990. Retrieved 2017-04-03.</ref> The product is now sold in another collapsible cardboard box.\n\n== Advertising ==\nThe earliest instances of McDonald's using advertising for the burger were mainly print ads, and a TV ad in which [[Hoyt Axton]] sings \"The Ballad of Big Mac\" which aired in 1969.\n\n=== ''Two all-beef patties'' slogan ===\nThe ''Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions \u2013 on a sesame seed bun'' concept for the jingle was created by Keith Reinhard, Chairman Emeritus of [[DDB Worldwide]], and his creative group at [[DDB Worldwide|Needham Harper and Steers]]. Originally, the ingredients appeared as a one-word heading for a McDonald's ad developed for college newspapers. The words were then set to music created by Mark Vieha, who performed the original jingle. The first run of commercials ran only a year and a half, going off the air in 1976, but its popularity remained beyond its TV life. Subsequent to the jingle, McDonald's followed up with a promotion based on its customers spontaneously having a \"Big Mac Attack\".\n\nIn the United States during the original campaign many franchises ran promotions that awarded a free burger to customers who could recite the slogan within a specified time (usually two or three seconds). One example of its success was that the McDonald's operators in New York City ran out of Big Mac buns.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} McDonald's Australia emulated this promotion in the mid-1980s, and some Brazilian McDonald's around the same time (only offering a free glass of [[Coca-Cola]] instead), in the Portuguese-language version, which is \"Dois hamb\u00fargueres, alface, queijo, molho especial, cebola e picles num p\u00e3o com gergelim\".\n\nIn 2003, McDonald's revived the phrase. In an English-language ad from McDonald's international \"[[i'm lovin' it]]\" campaign, a [[rapper]] rapidly spouts off the trademark in the background music. Also in 2003, [[American Greetings]] and [[Carlton Cards]] released a [[Christmas ornament]] of a Big Mac, on which the slogan was both printed and played aloud by pulling on a string. Roy Bergold, National Advertising Manager at McDonald's, has a big hand in championing the original campaign and helping to bring it back.\n\nIn 2008 McDonald's Malaysia revived the phrase. The revival includes the original prize of a free Big Mac if the customer is able to recite the phrase in under four seconds. It was released in May, along with the promotional ''Mega Mac'', which has four beef patties instead of two.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n=== 1980s advertising ===\nIn the early 1980s, as a promotion, McDonald's staged an in-house rivalry between their two most popular products. Consumers were invited to decide \"Which one will be number one? [[Chicken McNuggets]] or Big Mac sandwiches?\" For each of either item that a customer bought, they received another of the same at half price. Later in the ad campaign, the second was offered for free. It was eventually announced that the Big Mac was \"number one\".\n\nAds in the 1980s and early 1990s featured the character [[Mac Tonight]] and a parody of the song [[Mack the Knife]]. The character was pulled after settlement of a lawsuit by the estate of late singer [[Bobby Darin]], whose famous 1958 recording popularized the song.\n\n=== 2005 advertising ===\nIn 2005, McDonald's began offering [[product placement]] rewards to [[hip hop]] artists who [[name-dropping|namechecked]] the Big Mac in their music, giving US$5 to the artist for every time a song mentioning the hamburger was played on the radio.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4389751.stm |title=Return of the Mac \u2013 coming soon<!-- Bot generated title --> |work=BBC News |date=March 29, 2005 |accessdate=March 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224150429/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4389751.stm |archive-date=December 24, 2005 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This offer quickly spawned a satirical reference from hip hop artist [[Mad Skillz]], who references the marketing ploy in his track \"2005 Wrap Up\" by stating \"And I'm beefin' wit' Mickey D's man, y'all dead wrong, Talkin' 'bout payin' rappers to mention Big Macs in their song, We do rap from the heart, y'all better have some respect, Alright, Big Mac!
