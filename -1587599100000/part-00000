The band was originally the creation of [[Lou Adler]] and songwriting duo [[P. F. Sloan]] and [[Steve Barri]]. In their career, they achieved two [[gold album]]s, one [[gold single]] and charted singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] a total of 21 times. Among their charting singles, they achieved Top 10 three times, Top 20 three times and Top 40 fourteen times.<ref name=\"Grassroots in Billboard\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=0-8230-7690-3|date=January 2000|edition=7th|page=262}}</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4396|pure_url=yes}} Grass Roots at Allmusic]</ref> They have sold over 20 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"Official\">{{cite web|url=http://the-grassroots.com/html/biography.html |title=The Grassroots official website |publisher=The-grassroots.com |date= |accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\nUntil his death in 2011, early member [[Rob Grill]] and a newer lineup of the Grass Roots continued to play many live performances each year. By 2012, the group featured no original band members, with a lineup personally chosen by Grill carrying on the legacy of the group with nationwide live performances.\n\n==The founding years==\nThe name \"Grass Roots\" (originally spelled as one word \"Grassroots\") originated in mid-1965 as the name of a band project by the Los Angeles songwriter and producer duo of [[P.F. Sloan]] and [[Steve Barri]]. Sloan and Barri had written several [[songs]] in an attempt by their record company, [[Dunhill Records]] (owned by [[Lou Adler]]), to cash in on the budding [[folk rock]] movement. One of these songs was \"Where Were You When I Needed You,\" which was recorded by Sloan and Barri. Sloan provided the lead vocals and played guitar, [[Larry Knechtel]] played keyboards, [[Joe Osborn]] played the bass and [[Bones Howe]] was on drums.<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\">{{cite book\n| first= Kent\n| last= Hartman\n| year= 2012\n| title= The Wrecking Crew\n| publisher= St. Martin's Press\n| location= New York\n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749/page/169 169\u2013172]\n| isbn= 978-0-312-61974-9\n| url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749/page/169\n}}</ref> The song was released under \"The Grass Roots\" name and sent, as a demo, to several radio stations of the [[San Francisco Bay area]].\n\nWhen moderate interest in this new band arose, Sloan and Barri went to look for a group that could incorporate the Grass Roots name. They found one, The Bedouins, in a San Francisco band that won a [[Battle of the Bands]] at a Teenage Fair in [[San Mateo, California]].<ref name=\"Official\"/> A new version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" with that band's lead vocalist, Willie Fulton (later, an early member of [[Tower of Power]]) was recorded.\n\nIn late 1965, the Grass Roots got their first official [[radio airplay|airplay]] on [[Southern California]] radio stations, such as [[KLSD|KGB]] ([[Amplitude Modulation|AM]]) in [[San Diego]] and [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] in Los Angeles, with a version of the [[Bob Dylan]] song \"[[Ballad of a Thin Man|Mr. Jones (Ballad of a Thin Man)]]\". Dylan granted Sloan the opportunity to cover the song after Sloan showed appreciation for his first listen to Dylan's demo acetate of the song.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nFor some months, the group appeared as the first \"real\" Grass Roots. They were utilized by Dunhill to back up [[The Mamas & the Papas]] and [[Barry McGuire]] and became a house band at The Trip nightclub in [[Hollywood]]. The partnership with Sloan and Barri broke up when the band demanded more space for their own more [[blues rock]]-oriented material (which Dunhill was not willing to give them). Willie Fulton (lead vocals, guitar), Denny Ellis (guitar, backing vocals), and David Stensen (bass, backing vocals) went back to San Francisco, with drummer [[Joel Larson]] being the only one who remained in Los Angeles (he later returned to the group in 1971). Fulton, Ellis and Stensen continued to appear as the Grass Roots, with original Bedouins drummer Bill Shoppe, until Dunhill ordered them to cease since they decided to start all over again with another group they would groom to be the Grass Roots. In the meantime, the second version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" peaked in the [[Top 40]] in mid-1966, while an [[Where Were You When I Needed You|album of the same name]] sold poorly.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nStill looking for a group to record their material and promote it with live dates, in 1966 Sloan and Barri offered Wisconsin-based band [[The Robbs]] (for whom they produced some early material) a chance to assume the identity of the Grass Roots, but the group declined.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==The years of success==\n\nThe group's third \u2013 and by far most successful \u2013 incarnation was finally found in a Los Angeles band called The 13th Floor (not to be confused with [[the 13th Floor Elevators]]). This band consisted of [[Creed Bratton]] (vocals, guitar), [[Rick Coonce]] (drums, percussion), [[Warren Entner]] (vocals, guitar, keyboards), and Kenny Fukomoto (vocals, bass) and had formed only a year earlier. Entner, who had been attending film school at [[UCLA]] alongside future [[The Doors|Doors]] members [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Ray Manzarek]], was drifting through Europe in the summer of 1965 singing and playing on street corners, when he met fellow [[busker]] and American Creed Bratton in [[Israel]], where an Israeli businessman expressed interest in managing and promoting them. But the duo moved on individually and ended up back in LA by 1966, where they formed the 13th Floor and submitted a [[demo tape]] to [[Dunhill Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-grassroots.com/html/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=The-grassroots.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}</ref> After Fukomoto was suddenly drafted into the army, the group went through two replacements before finding singer/bassist [[Rob Grill]]. In 1967 the band was offered the choice to go with their own name or choose to adopt a name that had already been heard of nationwide.\n\nIn the beginning, they were one of many U.S. guitar [[popular music|pop]]/rock bands, but with the help of Barri and their other producers, they developed a unique sound for which they drew as heavily on British [[Beat music|beat]]<!--\"Beat (music)\" is about the basic concept. The genre is at \"Beat music\" (note the lack of parentheses in the title).--> as on [[soul music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[folk rock]]. Many of their recordings featured a [[brass section]], which was a novelty in those days among American rock bands, with groups like [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] just developing.\n\nThe bulk of the band's material continued to be written by Dunhill Records staff (not only Sloan and Barri) and the LA studio-musicians who were part of what became known as the [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]] played the music on most, if not all, of their hits.<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\"/> The Grass Roots also recorded songs written by the group's musicians, which appeared on their albums and the [[B-side]]s of many hit singles.\n\nAs the Grass Roots, they had their first [[Top 40|Top 10]] hit in the summer of 1967 with \"[[Let's Live for Today (song)|Let's Live for Today]]\", an English-language [[cover version]] of \"Piangi con me\", a 1966 hit for the Anglo-Italian quartet [[The Rokes]]. \"Let's Live for Today\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/222 222]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/222\n}}</ref> With [[Rob Grill]] as lead singer, they recorded a third version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You.\" The band continued in a similar hit-making vein for the next five years (1967\u20131972).\n\nThe Grass Roots played at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival]] on Sunday, June 11, 1967, in the \"[[Summer of Love]]\" as \"Let's Live for Today\" was at #15 and climbing.\n\nIn late 1967, the band recorded the album [[Feelings (The Grass Roots album)|''Feelings'']], which featured much heavier input in the songwriting and playing by the group members themselves. But its failure to sell prompted Barri to take full hold of the reins again as he began to move the band in a more R&B, horn punctuated, direction. By this time, Sloan had phased out of his involvement with the band and relocated to [[New York City]] to pursue a solo career.\n \nOn Sunday, October 27, 1968, the Grass Roots played at the [[San Francisco Pop Festival]] as their hit \"[[Midnight Confessions]]\" (their first record to feature horns, and with [[Carol Kaye]] playing the opening bass-line<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\"/>) was peaking at #5, and then played at the [[Los Angeles Pop Festival]] and [[Miami Pop Festival (December 1968)|Miami Pop Festival]] in December 1968.\n\nCreed Bratton became frustrated by Dunhill's refusal to allow the band to write its own songs and play the instruments on its records (although the members did play alone at concerts). After a disastrous appearance at the [[Fillmore West]] in April 1969, a \"slightly inebriated\" Bratton was asked to leave the band.<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\"/> He was replaced by [[Dennis Provisor]] on keyboards and vocals, and lead guitarist Terry Furlong [http://Terry-Furlong.com] (1970\u20131971) was brought in the following year to form a quintet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Record-World-IDX/IDX/70s/70/RW-1970-08-08-OCR-Page-0060.pdf#search=%22the%20ubiquitous%20grass%20roots%22 |title=Record World Magazine Interview |date= |accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> This was the first of many line-up changes for this version of the band.\n\nThe Grass Roots, with their new members, played at [[Newport Pop Festival]] 1969 at [[Devonshire Downs]], which was a racetrack at the time but now is part of the North Campus for [[California State University, Northridge]]. The group played on Sunday June 22, 1969, a week before their hit \"I'd Wait A Million Years\" reached the Hot 100. In Canada they played at the [[Vancouver Pop Festival]] at the Paradise Valley Resort in British Columbia in August 1969.\n\nBy 1971 Furlong had stopped touring with the group to pursue a solo career but would continue to contribute on the records during the rest of their time on Dunhill. His touring replacement was Brian Naughton, who left in 1972. Drummer Rick Coonce was gone as well by the beginning of 1972 and new members Joe Pollard (drums, percussion) and another guitarist named Terry (last name unknown) joined up. Terry was soon replaced by Reed Kailing (vocals, guitars). However, drummer Pollard and keyboardist Dennis Provisor left soon after to go out as a duo (although Provisor was featured on the band's 1972 ''[[Move Along (The Grass Roots album)|Move Along]]'' album) and were replaced by a returning Rick Coonce and keyboard man Virgil Weber (ex-[[Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds]] and [[Climax (band)|Climax]]). Coonce was back for only a short period before he was gone again, turning the drum throne over to original member Joel Larson. Singers Rob Grill and Warren Entner remained the point of focus during these years.\n\nThe group's songs during 1967\u20131972 include: \"Let's Live for Today\", a cover of an Italian hit by [[The Rokes]], \"Piangi con me\" (U.S. #8) and \"Things I Should Have Said\" (U.S. #23) (1967); \"[[Midnight Confessions]]\" (U.S. #5, their biggest hit) (1968); \"Bella Linda\" (a cover of an Italian hit by [[Lucio Battisti]], \"[[Balla Linda]]\") (U.S. #28), \"Lovin' Things\" (a cover of a UK hit by [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]] the previous year) (U.S. #49), \"[[The River Is Wide]]\" (U.S. #31), \"I'd Wait a Million Years\" (U.S. #15), and \"Heaven Knows\" (U.S. #24) (1969); \"Walking Through the Country\" (U.S. #44), and \"Baby Hold On\" (U.S. #35) (1970); \"Temptation Eyes\" (#15), \"Sooner or Later\" (U.S. #9), and \"Two Divided by Love\" (U.S. #16) (1971); \"Glory Bound\" (U.S. #34) and \"The Runway\" (U.S. #39) (1972).\n\nBy early 1974, the Grass Roots had left Dunhill (now [[ABC Records]]) and Kailing, Weber and longtime member Entner (later a successful manager with groups such as [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Quiet Riot]]) moved on, while former members Terry Furlong and Dennis Provisor returned to the fold. Furlong left permanently by mid-1974 to be succeeded by Gene Barkin, then by [[Reggie Knighton]]. The resulting group was Grill, Larson, Provisor and Knighton. [[Dennis Lambert]] and [[Brian Potter (musician)|Brian Potter]], who had penned the group's 1971 hit \"Two Divided By Love\" and many others, invited the band to join their Haven label, where they released an eponymous album in 1975, ''The Grass Roots'', containing the single \"Mamacita\", which charted at #71 on the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up singles failed to chart.\n\n==The later years==\n\n===1976 to 1981===\nTheir 1976 single \"Out In The Open\" proved to be their [[swan song]] on Haven. Knighton left in 1976 and Alan Deane took over, followed by guitarist Glen Shulfer in 1977. ABC Records issued a final greatest hits package of the group titled ''ABC Collection'' in 1976. But in late 1977, Grill decided to take a break from performing and later recorded the ''14 Greats'' album on Gusto Records featuring himself and Provisor. This album consisted of 1978 rerecordings of their hits.\n\nThe group, still managed and booked by Grill (who owned the group's name),in late 1977 continued touring with Larson, Mark Miller (lead vocals, guitar) and Brian Carlyss (bass, backing vocals), joined by Lonnie Price (lead vocals, keyboards) and Randy Ruff (organ, backing vocals) for touring dates and TV appearances until November 1978. Larson was then joined by new players Scott Hoyt (lead vocals, guitars), David Nagy (lead vocals, bass) and Gene Wall (keyboards). Nagy and Larson left in 1979 and were replaced by a returning Carlyss and Reagan McKinley (drums, percussion).\n\nDuring this period, the group appeared on an HBO television special, \"60's Rock Scrapbook\", filmed at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] amusement park in [[Valencia, California]] in October 1979, with Grill and Dennis Provisor making special appearances.\n\nGrill launched a solo career in 1979 (assisted on his solo album, ''Uprooted'', by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[John McVie]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] on the song \"Rock Sugar\"). Grill toured as a solo act in 1979\u20131980 opening for Fleetwood Mac's [[Tusk Tour|''Tusk'' Tour]] with a band led by guitarist Rick Alexander.<ref name=\"Official Members\">{{cite web|url=http://the-grassroots.com/html/group_members.html|title=The Grassroots official members |publisher=The-grassroots.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}</ref>\n\nWhen interest in [[bands of the 1960s]] began to rise again in 1980, Grill (along with Provisor, Shulfer and new players Steve Berendt (bass) and Luke Meurett (drums) took back the Grass Roots name and toured the United States and Japan. Guitarist Miller returned to sub more dates with the group in 1981.\n\n===1982 to 1993===\nIn 1982 Grill decided to go forward with a brand new lineup consisting of seasoned session players. They were Terry Oubre (guitars, backing vocals), Charles Judge (keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Ralph Gilmore (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Another keyboardist, Bob Luna, came in around mid-1982 to sub for Judge on dates when he wasn't available. That same year, the new band released ''Powers of the Night'' on MCA. This would be the last album of new material to be released by the Grass Roots.\n\nLater in 1982, the Grass Roots performed an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] concert on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., attracting a large crowd and setting a record for attendance (over half a million people), at that time, for an outdoor concert for a single musical act.<ref>\"July 4: Day of Music, Parades, Fireworks\", ''The Washington Post'', Washington, D.C., July 3, 1982, p. D1.</ref><ref name=\"McCombs\">Phil McCombs, \"Watt Outlaws Rock Music on Mall for July 4\", ''The Washington Post'', Washington, D.C., April 6, 1983, p.

Watt]], [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]]'s [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \"rock bands\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \"the wrong element\", who would [[robbery|mug]] people and families attending any similar events in the future.<ref name=\"McCombs\" /> During the ensuing uproar, Grill stated that he felt \"highly insulted\" by Watt's remarks, which he called \"nothing but un-American\".<ref name=\"McCombs\" />\n\nAfter ''Powers'' failed to attract much attention, Grill and the group continued to tour into 1984. Dave Rodgers (keyboards, backing vocals) replaced Charles Judge and after Terry Oubre and Ralph Gilmore departed, Grill brought in two additional new players named George Spellman (guitars, backing vocals) and Coy Fuller (drums, percussion) and headed over to tour Europe in the summer of '84. According to Grill, there was also a country single, \"St. Somewhere\", recorded in [[Nashville]] with this same lineup. This single was never released.\n\nBy late 1984, Grill had returned to the US and was touring with yet another new group of Grass Roots that included Dusty Hanvey (guitars, backing vocals), Larry Nelson (keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and David Page (drums, percussion). This lineup's first show was in [[Okinawa]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nFrom this point on, Grill and the group would concentrate on the \"60s nostalgia\" circuit, starting with the ''Happy Together 85'' Tour with fellow 1960s groups [[The Turtles]], [[The Buckinghams]] and [[Gary Lewis & the Playboys]].<ref name=\"Inc.1985\">{{cite book|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|date=1 June 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986 another package had them appearing with [[The Monkees]], [[Gary Puckett]], and [[Herman's Hermits]]. They were joined in this show by bassist [[Mark Clarke (musician)|Mark Clarke]] (ex-[[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]) and a horn section, and backed up the Monkees and Gary Puckett during their sets as well.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHanvey and Nelson continued backing the Monkees for their 1987 tour, while the Grass Roots joined ''Classic Superfest'', which also featured Herman's Hermits, [[Mark Lindsay]], and [[Gene Clark]]'s [[Byrds]]. For this tour, Mark Tamorsky handled guitar and Michael Lewis (soon replaced by Robbie Barker) was on keyboards. Terry Danauer was also added on bass at this point. But by October 1987, Hanvey and Nelson were back with Grill and Joe Dougherty replaced David Page on drums in 1989.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1991 Rhino Records released a double CD anthology of the group.\n\nMike Stec came in for Danauer on bass in 1992\u20131993 before Grill took over bass again. From here on the band's lineup was stable.\n\n===1994 to 2011===\nOn January 16, 1999 former Grass Roots members Joel Larson, Virgil Weber and Creed Bratton, along with Paul Downing on vocals and lead guitar (of [[Herman's Hermits]] & [[The Standells]]), Justin Chats on vocals, keyboards and saxophone, Dan Schwartz on bass and David Olson on backing vocals, were part of a 35th Anniversary Celebration at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Los Angeles. They shared the stage with [[Johnny Rivers]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], the [[Robby Krieger]] Band and [[Drake Levin]] and [[Phil Volk]] of [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]].\n\nIn 2000 Grill released a Grass Roots live concert album titled ''Live at Last'', which was followed in 2001 by an album with a symphonic quartet titled ''Symphonic Hits''.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nDuring the 2000s, the group regulars had available substitutes (former [[The Outsiders (American band)|Outsiders]] singer [[Sonny Geraci]] sat in for Grill during the first half of 2002, Scott Sechman filled in for Hanvey in 1998, Chris Merrell filled in for Hanvey on various dates 2000\u20132006, while Hal Ratliff came in for Nelson when he had other commitments from 2000 on).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 2008 Grill released a second live concert album titled ''Live Gold'' and brought in Mark Dawson (vocals, bass) earlier that same year to fill in when he was absent.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nDuring the summers of 2010 and 2011, the Grass Roots had heavy touring schedules throughout the U.S., both on their own and as part of the ''Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour'', along with [[Flo & Eddie]] of [[The Turtles]], [[Mark Lindsay]], [[The Buckinghams]], and [[Monkees]] member [[Micky Dolenz]].

Certification]]\n\n==Pop culture==\n* The name Grass Roots was used sporadically by [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]] of [[Love (band)|Love]], in the Los Angeles area. Dunhill Records secured the legal use of the name by releasing a record, which Lee never did.\n* The song \"Let's Live for Today\" has the identical Italian melody and virtually the same arrangement that was used in an earlier song called \"Be Mine Again\"; although this song includes the \"One, Two, Three, Four\" and \"Sha-La-La-La-La\" as in the Grass Roots hit, the lyrics are otherwise different. The version by Dutch band The Skope that was released in 1966 is included on the ''[[Pebbles, Volume 15]]'' LP.\n* The band was seen in the [[Doris Day]] film ''[[With Six You Get Eggroll]]''. They play the song \"Feelings\" at a crowded dance party.\n* The Grass Roots have appeared on over 50 national television shows including, ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', [[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan]], [[Andy Williams]], [[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour|Sonny & Cher]], ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[VH1]] Hit-Makers, [[MTV]], and a record 16 times on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''.\n* The 1975 ''The Grass Roots'' LP is seen in the film ''[[FM (movie)|FM]]''. The back cover appears in a long DJ broadcast room scene with characters played by [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Martin Mull]].\n* The band is mentioned by [[John Candy]]'s character in the film ''[[Uncle Buck]]''. He comments about the music while navigating a teenage party looking for his missing niece.\n* Guitarist [[Creed Bratton]] played a character also named [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed Bratton]], a fictional version of himself, in the US version of the television show ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. In a scene that never aired from the episode \"[[Booze Cruise (The Office episode)|Booze Cruise]]\", Bratton's boss, Michael, borrowed the guitar from a [[cruise ship]]'s band and poorly plays a version of \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\" by [[Deep Purple]]. Bratton then takes the guitar from Michael and proceeds to surprise the rest of the passengers with his excellent playing. The scene then cuts to a confessional, where Bratton talks of his time with the Grass Roots, complete with pictures of the actual band and references to actual tours. In another deleted scene from the episode \"[[Product Recall (The Office episode)|Product Recall]]\", a fictional ''[[Scranton Times]]'' writer notices Bratton was a member of the Grass Roots. He also sang one of his own songs titled \"Spinnin' N Reelin'\" in the episode \"[[A Benihana Christmas]]\".

The band was originally the creation of [[Lou Adler]] and songwriting duo [[P. F. Sloan]] and [[Steve Barri]]. In their career, they achieved two [[gold album]]s, one [[gold single]] and charted singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] a total of 21 times. Among their charting singles, they achieved Top 10 three times, Top 20 three times and Top 40 eight times.<ref name=\"Grassroots in Billboard\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=0-8230-7690-3|date=January 2000|edition=7th|page=262}}</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4396|pure_url=yes}} Grass Roots at Allmusic]</ref> They have sold over 20 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"Official\">{{cite web|url=http://the-grassroots.com/html/biography.html |title=The Grassroots official website |publisher=The-grassroots.com |date= |accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\nUntil his death in 2011, early member [[Rob Grill]] and a newer lineup of the Grass Roots continued to play many live performances each year. By 2012, the group featured no original band members, with a lineup personally chosen by Grill carrying on the legacy of the group with nationwide live performances.\n\n==The founding years==\nThe name \"Grass Roots\" (originally spelled as one word \"Grassroots\") originated in mid-1965 as the name of a band project by the Los Angeles songwriter and producer duo of [[P.F. Sloan]] and [[Steve Barri]]. Sloan and Barri had written several [[songs]] in an attempt by their record company, [[Dunhill Records]] (owned by [[Lou Adler]]), to cash in on the budding [[folk rock]] movement. One of these songs was \"Where Were You When I Needed You,\" which was recorded by Sloan and Barri. Sloan provided the lead vocals and played guitar, [[Larry Knechtel]] played keyboards, [[Joe Osborn]] played the bass and [[Bones Howe]] was on drums.<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\">{{cite book\n| first= Kent\n| last= Hartman\n| year= 2012\n| title= The Wrecking Crew\n| publisher= St. Martin's Press\n| location= New York\n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749/page/169 169\u2013172]\n| isbn= 978-0-312-61974-9\n| url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749/page/169\n}}</ref> The song was released under \"The Grass Roots\" name and sent, as a demo, to several radio stations of the [[San Francisco Bay area]].\n\nWhen moderate interest in this new band arose, Sloan and Barri went to look for a group that could incorporate the Grass Roots name. They found one, The Bedouins, in a San Francisco band that won a [[Battle of the Bands]] at a Teenage Fair in [[San Mateo, California]].<ref name=\"Official\"/> A new version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" with that band's lead vocalist, Willie Fulton (later, an early member of [[Tower of Power]]) was recorded.\n\nIn late 1965, the Grass Roots got their first official [[radio airplay|airplay]] on [[Southern California]] radio stations, such as [[KLSD|KGB]] ([[Amplitude Modulation|AM]]) in [[San Diego]] and [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] in Los Angeles, with a version of the [[Bob Dylan]] song \"[[Ballad of a Thin Man|Mr. Jones (Ballad of a Thin Man)]]\". Dylan granted Sloan the opportunity to cover the song after Sloan showed appreciation for his first listen to Dylan's demo acetate of the song.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nFor some months, the group appeared as the first \"real\" Grass Roots. They were utilized by Dunhill to back up [[The Mamas & the Papas]] and [[Barry McGuire]] and became a house band at The Trip nightclub in [[Hollywood]]. The partnership with Sloan and Barri broke up when the band demanded more space for their own more [[blues rock]]-oriented material (which Dunhill was not willing to give them). Willie Fulton (lead vocals, guitar), Denny Ellis (guitar, backing vocals), and David Stensen (bass, backing vocals) went back to San Francisco, with drummer [[Joel Larson]] being the only one who remained in Los Angeles (he later returned to the group in 1971). Fulton, Ellis and Stensen continued to appear as the Grass Roots, with original Bedouins drummer Bill Shoppe, until Dunhill ordered them to cease since they decided to start all over again with another group they would groom to be the Grass Roots. In the meantime, the second version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" peaked in the [[Top 40]] in mid-1966, while an [[Where Were You When I Needed You|album of the same name]] sold poorly.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nStill looking for a group to record their material and promote it with live dates, in 1966 Sloan and Barri offered Wisconsin-based band [[The Robbs]] (for whom they produced some early material) a chance to assume the identity of the Grass Roots, but the group declined.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==The years of success==\n\nThe group's third \u2013 and by far most successful \u2013 incarnation was finally found in a Los Angeles band called The 13th Floor (not to be confused with [[the 13th Floor Elevators]]). This band consisted of [[Creed Bratton]] (vocals, guitar), [[Rick Coonce]] (drums, percussion), [[Warren Entner]] (vocals, guitar, keyboards), and Kenny Fukomoto (vocals, bass) and had formed only a year earlier. Entner, who had been attending film school at [[UCLA]] alongside future [[The Doors|Doors]] members [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Ray Manzarek]], was drifting through Europe in the summer of 1965 singing and playing on street corners, when he met fellow [[busker]] and American Creed Bratton in [[Israel]], where an Israeli businessman expressed interest in managing and promoting them. But the duo moved on individually and ended up back in LA by 1966, where they formed the 13th Floor and submitted a [[demo tape]] to [[Dunhill Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-grassroots.com/html/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=The-grassroots.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-10}}</ref> After Fukomoto was suddenly drafted into the army, the group went through two replacements before finding singer/bassist [[Rob Grill]]. In 1967 the band was offered the choice to go with their own name or choose to adopt a name that had already been heard of nationwide.\n\nIn the beginning, they were one of many U.S. guitar [[popular music|pop]]/rock bands, but with the help of Barri and their other producers, they developed a unique sound for which they drew as heavily on British [[Beat music|beat]]<!--\"Beat (music)\" is about the basic concept. The genre is at \"Beat music\" (note the lack of parentheses in the title).--> as on [[soul music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[folk rock]]. Many of their recordings featured a [[brass section]], which was a novelty in those days among American rock bands, with groups like [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] just developing.\n\nThe bulk of the band's material continued to be written by Dunhill Records staff (not only Sloan and Barri) and the LA studio-musicians who were part of what became known as the [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]] played the music on most, if not all, of their hits.<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\"/> The Grass Roots also recorded songs written by the group's musicians, which appeared on their albums and the [[B-side]]s of many hit singles.\n\nAs the Grass Roots, they had their first [[Top 40|Top 10]] hit in the summer of 1967 with \"[[Let's Live for Today (song)|Let's Live for Today]]\", an English-language [[cover version]] of \"Piangi con me\", a 1966 hit for the Anglo-Italian quartet [[The Rokes]]. \"Let's Live for Today\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/222 222]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/222\n}}</ref> With [[Rob Grill]] as lead singer, they recorded a third version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You.\" The band continued in a similar hit-making vein for the next five years (1967\u20131972).\n\nThe Grass Roots played at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival]] on Sunday, June 11, 1967, in the \"[[Summer of Love]]\" as \"Let's Live for Today\" was at #15 and climbing.\n\nIn late 1967, the band recorded the album [[Feelings (The Grass Roots album)|''Feelings'']], which featured much heavier input in the songwriting and playing by the group members themselves. But its failure to sell prompted Barri to take full hold of the reins again as he began to move the band in a more R&B, horn punctuated, direction. By this time, Sloan had phased out of his involvement with the band and relocated to [[New York City]] to pursue a solo career.\n \nOn Sunday, October 27, 1968, the Grass Roots played at the [[San Francisco Pop Festival]] as their hit \"[[Midnight Confessions]]\" (their first record to feature horns, and with [[Carol Kaye]] playing the opening bass-line<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\"/>) was peaking at #5, and then played at the [[Los Angeles Pop Festival]] and [[Miami Pop Festival (December 1968)|Miami Pop Festival]] in December 1968.\n\nCreed Bratton became frustrated by Dunhill's refusal to allow the band to write its own songs and play the instruments on its records (although the members did play alone at concerts). After a disastrous appearance at the [[Fillmore West]] in April 1969, a \"slightly inebriated\" Bratton was asked to leave the band.<ref name=\"The Wrecking Crew\"/> He was replaced by [[Dennis Provisor]] on keyboards and vocals, and lead guitarist Terry Furlong [http://Terry-Furlong.com] (1970\u20131971) was brought in the following year to form a quintet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Record-World-IDX/IDX/70s/70/RW-1970-08-08-OCR-Page-0060.pdf#search=%22the%20ubiquitous%20grass%20roots%22 |title=Record World Magazine Interview |date= |accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> This was the first of many line-up changes for this version of the band.\n\nThe Grass Roots, with their new members, played at [[Newport Pop Festival]] 1969 at [[Devonshire Downs]], which was a racetrack at the time but now is part of the North Campus for [[California State University, Northridge]]. The group played on Sunday June 22, 1969, a week before their hit \"I'd Wait A Million Years\" reached the Hot 100. In Canada they played at the [[Vancouver Pop Festival]] at the Paradise Valley Resort in British Columbia in August 1969.\n\nBy 1971 Furlong had stopped touring with the group to pursue a solo career but would continue to contribute on the records during the rest of their time on Dunhill. His touring replacement was Brian Naughton, who left in 1972. Drummer Rick Coonce was gone as well by the beginning of 1972 and new members Joe Pollard (drums, percussion) and another guitarist named Terry (last name unknown) joined up. Terry was soon replaced by Reed Kailing (vocals, guitars). However, drummer Pollard and keyboardist Dennis Provisor left soon after to go out as a duo (although Provisor was featured on the band's 1972 ''[[Move Along (The Grass Roots album)|Move Along]]'' album) and were replaced by a returning Rick Coonce and keyboard man Virgil Weber (ex-[[Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds]] and [[Climax (band)|Climax]]). Coonce was back for only a short period before he was gone again, turning the drum throne over to original member Joel Larson. Singers Rob Grill and Warren Entner remained the point of focus during these years.\n\nThe group's songs during 1967\u20131972 include: \"Let's Live for Today\", a cover of an Italian hit by [[The Rokes]], \"Piangi con me\" (U.S. #8) and \"Things I Should Have Said\" (U.S. #23) (1967); \"[[Midnight Confessions]]\" (U.S. #5, their biggest hit) (1968); \"Bella Linda\" (a cover of an Italian hit by [[Lucio Battisti]], \"[[Balla Linda]]\") (U.S. #28), \"Lovin' Things\" (a cover of a UK hit by [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]] the previous year) (U.S. #49), \"[[The River Is Wide]]\" (U.S. #31), \"I'd Wait a Million Years\" (U.S. #15), and \"Heaven Knows\" (U.S. #24) (1969); \"Walking Through the Country\" (U.S. #44), and \"Baby Hold On\" (U.S. #35) (1970); \"Temptation Eyes\" (#15), \"Sooner or Later\" (U.S. #9), and \"Two Divided by Love\" (U.S. #16) (1971); \"Glory Bound\" (U.S. #34) and \"The Runway\" (U.S. #39) (1972).\n\nBy early 1974, the Grass Roots had left Dunhill (now [[ABC Records]]) and Kailing, Weber and longtime member Entner (later a successful manager with groups such as [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Quiet Riot]]) moved on, while former members Terry Furlong and Dennis Provisor returned to the fold. Furlong left permanently by mid-1974 to be succeeded by Gene Barkin, then by [[Reggie Knighton]]. The resulting group was Grill, Larson, Provisor and Knighton. [[Dennis Lambert]] and [[Brian Potter (musician)|Brian Potter]], who had penned the group's 1971 hit \"Two Divided By Love\" and many others, invited the band to join their Haven label, where they released an eponymous album in 1975, ''The Grass Roots'', containing the single \"Mamacita\", which charted at #71 on the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up singles failed to chart.\n\n==The later years==\n\n===1976 to 1981===\nTheir 1976 single \"Out In The Open\" proved to be their [[swan song]] on Haven. Knighton left in 1976 and Alan Deane took over, followed by guitarist Glen Shulfer in 1977. ABC Records issued a final greatest hits package of the group titled ''ABC Collection'' in 1976. But in late 1977, Grill decided to take a break from performing and later recorded the ''14 Greats'' album on Gusto Records featuring himself and Provisor. This album consisted of 1978 rerecordings of their hits.\n\nThe group, still managed and booked by Grill (who owned the group's name),in late 1977 continued touring with Larson, Mark Miller (lead vocals, guitar) and Brian Carlyss (bass, backing vocals), joined by Lonnie Price (lead vocals, keyboards) and Randy Ruff (organ, backing vocals) for touring dates and TV appearances until November 1978. Larson was then joined by new players Scott Hoyt (lead vocals, guitars), David Nagy (lead vocals, bass) and Gene Wall (keyboards). Nagy and Larson left in 1979 and were replaced by a returning Carlyss and Reagan McKinley (drums, percussion).\n\nDuring this period, the group appeared on an HBO television special, \"60's Rock Scrapbook\", filmed at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] amusement park in [[Valencia, California]] in October 1979, with Grill and Dennis Provisor making special appearances.\n\nGrill launched a solo career in 1979 (assisted on his solo album, ''Uprooted'', by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[John McVie]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] on the song \"Rock Sugar\"). Grill toured as a solo act in 1979\u20131980 opening for Fleetwood Mac's [[Tusk Tour|''Tusk'' Tour]] with a band led by guitarist Rick Alexander.<ref name=\"Official Members\">{{cite web|url=http://the-grassroots.com/html/group_members.html|title=The Grassroots official members |publisher=The-grassroots.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-24}}</ref>\n\nWhen interest in [[bands of the 1960s]] began to rise again in 1980, Grill (along with Provisor, Shulfer and new players Steve Berendt (bass) and Luke Meurett (drums) took back the Grass Roots name and toured the United States and Japan. Guitarist Miller returned to sub more dates with the group in 1981.\n\n===1982 to 1993===\nIn 1982 Grill decided to go forward with a brand new lineup consisting of seasoned session players. They were Terry Oubre (guitars, backing vocals), Charles Judge (keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Ralph Gilmore (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Another keyboardist, Bob Luna, came in around mid-1982 to sub for Judge on dates when he wasn't available. That same year, the new band released ''Powers of the Night'' on MCA. This would be the last album of new material to be released by the Grass Roots.\n\nLater in 1982, the Grass Roots performed an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] concert on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., attracting a large crowd and setting a record for attendance (over half a million people), at that time, for an outdoor concert for a single musical act.<ref>\"July 4: Day of Music, Parades, Fireworks\", ''The Washington Post'', Washington, D.C., July 3, 1982, p.

Watt]], [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]]'s [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \"rock bands\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \"the wrong element\", who would [[robbery|mug]] people and families attending any similar events in the future.<ref name=\"McCombs\" /> During the ensuing uproar, Grill stated that he felt \"highly insulted\" by Watt's remarks, which he called \"nothing but un-American\".<ref name=\"McCombs\" />\n\nAfter ''Powers'' failed to attract much attention, Grill and the group continued to tour into 1984. Dave Rodgers (keyboards, backing vocals) replaced Charles Judge and after Terry Oubre and Ralph Gilmore departed, Grill brought in two additional new players named George Spellman (guitars, backing vocals) and Coy Fuller (drums, percussion) and headed over to tour Europe in the summer of '84. According to Grill, there was also a country single, \"St. Somewhere\", recorded in [[Nashville]] with this same lineup. This single was never released.\n\nBy late 1984, Grill had returned to the US and was touring with yet another new group of Grass Roots that included Dusty Hanvey (guitars, backing vocals), Larry Nelson (keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and David Page (drums, percussion). This lineup's first show was in [[Okinawa]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nFrom this point on, Grill and the group would concentrate on the \"60s nostalgia\" circuit, starting with the ''Happy Together 85'' Tour with fellow 1960s groups [[The Turtles]], [[The Buckinghams]] and [[Gary Lewis & the Playboys]].<ref name=\"Inc.1985\">{{cite book|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|date=1 June 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986 another package had them appearing with [[The Monkees]], [[Gary Puckett]], and [[Herman's Hermits]]. They were joined in this show by bassist [[Mark Clarke (musician)|Mark Clarke]] (ex-[[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]) and a horn section, and backed up the Monkees and Gary Puckett during their sets as well.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nHanvey and Nelson continued backing the Monkees for their 1987 tour, while the Grass Roots joined ''Classic Superfest'', which also featured Herman's Hermits, [[Mark Lindsay]], and [[Gene Clark]]'s [[Byrds]]. For this tour, Mark Tamorsky handled guitar and Michael Lewis (soon replaced by Robbie Barker) was on keyboards. Terry Danauer was also added on bass at this point. But by October 1987, Hanvey and Nelson were back with Grill and Joe Dougherty replaced David Page on drums in 1989.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1991 Rhino Records released a double CD anthology of the group.\n\nMike Stec came in for Danauer on bass in 1992\u20131993 before Grill took over bass again. From here on the band's lineup was stable.\n\n===1994 to 2011===\nOn January 16, 1999 former Grass Roots members Joel Larson, Virgil Weber and Creed Bratton, along with Paul Downing on vocals and lead guitar (of [[Herman's Hermits]] & [[The Standells]]), Justin Chats on vocals, keyboards and saxophone, Dan Schwartz on bass and David Olson on backing vocals, were part of a 35th Anniversary Celebration at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Los Angeles. They shared the stage with [[Johnny Rivers]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], the [[Robby Krieger]] Band and [[Drake Levin]] and [[Phil Volk]] of [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]].\n\nIn 2000 Grill released a Grass Roots live concert album titled ''Live at Last'', which was followed in 2001 by an album with a symphonic quartet titled ''Symphonic Hits''.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nDuring the 2000s, the group regulars had available substitutes (former [[The Outsiders (American band)|Outsiders]] singer [[Sonny Geraci]] sat in for Grill during the first half of 2002, Scott Sechman filled in for Hanvey in 1998, Chris Merrell filled in for Hanvey on various dates 2000\u20132006, while Hal Ratliff came in for Nelson when he had other commitments from 2000 on).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 2008 Grill released a second live concert album titled ''Live Gold'' and brought in Mark Dawson (vocals, bass) earlier that same year to fill in when he was absent.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nDuring the summers of 2010 and 2011, the Grass Roots had heavy touring schedules throughout the U.S., both on their own and as part of the ''Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour'', along with [[Flo & Eddie]] of [[The Turtles]], [[Mark Lindsay]], [[The Buckinghams]], and [[Monkees]] member [[Micky Dolenz]].

Dunhill Records secured the legal use of the name by releasing a record, which Lee never did.\n* The song \"Let's Live for Today\" has the identical Italian melody and virtually the same arrangement that was used in an earlier song called \"Be Mine Again\"; although this song includes the \"One, Two, Three, Four\" and \"Sha-La-La-La-La\" as in the Grass Roots hit, the lyrics are otherwise different. The version by Dutch band The Skope that was released in 1966 is included on the ''[[Pebbles, Volume 15]]'' LP.\n* The band was seen in the [[Doris Day]] film ''[[With Six You Get Eggroll]]''. They play the song \"Feelings\" at a crowded dance party.\n* The Grass Roots have appeared on over 50 national television shows including, ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', [[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan]], [[Andy Williams]], [[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour|Sonny & Cher]], ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[VH1]] Hit-Makers, [[MTV]], and a record 16 times on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''.\n* The 1975 ''The Grass Roots'' LP is seen in the film ''[[FM (movie)|FM]]''. The back cover appears in a long DJ broadcast room scene with characters played by [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Martin Mull]].\n* The band is mentioned by [[John Candy]]'s character in the film ''[[Uncle Buck]]''. He comments about the music while navigating a teenage party looking for his missing niece.\n* Guitarist [[Creed Bratton]] played a character also named [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed Bratton]], a fictional version of himself, in the US version of the television show ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. In a scene that never aired from the episode \"[[Booze Cruise (The Office episode)|Booze Cruise]]\", Bratton's boss, Michael, borrowed the guitar from a [[cruise ship]]'s band and poorly plays a version of \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\" by [[Deep Purple]]. Bratton then takes the guitar from Michael and proceeds to surprise the rest of the passengers with his excellent playing. The scene then cuts to a confessional, where Bratton talks of his time with the Grass Roots, complete with pictures of the actual band and references to actual tours. In another deleted scene from the episode \"[[Product Recall (The Office episode)|Product Recall]]\", a fictional ''[[Scranton Times]]'' writer notices Bratton was a member of the Grass Roots. He also sang one of his own songs titled \"Spinnin' N Reelin'\" in the episode \"[[A Benihana Christmas]]\". In the [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]], it is revealed in the actual episode that Creed was a member of the Grass Roots. Creed performs his own song \"All the Faces\" to close out the episode.\n* The band was mentioned frequently on the nationally syndicated [[Don and Mike Show|Don and Mike radio show]]. [[Don Geronimo]] sat in with the band several times at performances in the Washington, D.C. area.\n* The Grass Roots version of the [[Bob Dylan]] song \"[[Ballad of a Thin Man]]\" was featured in the 1987 [[Robin Williams]] film ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.\n* The Grass Roots song \"Midnight Confessions\" was featured in the 1997 film ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]''.\n* In 2006 former manager [[Marty Angelo]] published a book entitled ''Once Life Matters: A New Beginning'', which has numerous stories about his life on the road with Rob Grill and the Grass Roots back in the early 1970s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|California|Los Angeles|Music|Rock music}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://the-grassroots.com}}\n* [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4396|pure_url=yes}} The Grass Roots at AllMusic.com]\n{{The Grass Roots}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grass Roots, The}}\n[[Category:ABC Records artists]]\n[[Category:Dunhill Records artists]]\n[[Category:MCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:American pop rock music groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1966]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic pop music groups]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic rock music groups from California]]\n", "name_user": "Gobama404", "label": "safe", "comment": "increased top 40 total of hits to fourteen", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grass_Roots"}

It tessthhagsrsgyuxulls of the [[ministry of Jesus]] from his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] by [[John the Baptist]] to his death and burial and the discovery of the [[empty tomb]]{{snd}}there is no [[genealogy of Jesus]] or birth narrative, nor, in the original ending at [[Mark 16|chapter 16]], any [[post-resurrection appearances of Jesus]]. It portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action, an [[Exorcism|exorcist]], a healer, and a miracle worker. Jesus is also the [[Son of God]], but he keeps his identity secret (the [[Messianic Secret]]), concealing it in [[parables]] so that even most of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] fail to understand. All this is in keeping with prophecy, which foretold the fate of the [[messiah]] as [[suffering servant]].{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=252\u201353}} The gospel ends, in its original version, with the discovery of the empty tomb, a promise to meet again in Galilee, and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the [[resurrection of Christ|resurrection]].{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nMost scholars date Mark to AD 65-75.{{sfn|Perkins|2007|p=137}} They reject the traditional ascription to [[Mark the Evangelist]], the companion of the [[Apostle Peter]], which probably arose from the desire of early Christians to link the work to an authoritative figure, and believe it to be the work of an author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=156}} It was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as an inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel, [[gospel of Matthew|Matthew]].{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=2}} The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from [[gospel of John|John]], and only distantly from Mark.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=1\u20133}} It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and [[gospel of Luke|Luke]].{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=1\u20133}} The hypothesis of [[Marcan priority]] (that Mark was written first) continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering [[Son of God]].{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n==Composition, genre, and setting==\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna 087.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]]]]\n[[File:Synoptic problem, two-source hypothesis.svg|thumb|The two-source hypothesis: Most scholars agree that Mark was the first of the gospels to be composed, and that the authors of Matthew and Luke used it plus a second document called the [[Q source]] when composing their own gospels. The blue sections indicate material original to Luke and Matthew.]]\n\n===Authorship and genre===\nThe Gospel of Mark is anonymous.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=63\u201364}} It was written in Greek for a gentile audience, probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have also been suggested.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=157}} Early Christian tradition attributes it to the John Mark mentioned in Acts, but scholars generally reject this as an attempt to link the gospel to an authoritative figure.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=156}} It was probably written c. AD 66\u201370, during [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians in Rome or the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish revolt]], as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.{{sfn|Perkins|2007|p=241}} The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1\u20133:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (13:1\u201337), and collections of sayings (although not the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]]).{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13\u201314}} Scholars accept that parts of Mark, such as the Passion Narrative, date as early as AD 40. {{sfn|Charlesworth|2013|p=118}}\n\nThe consensus among modern scholars is that the gospels are a subset of the ancient genre of ''bios'', or [[ancient biography]].{{sfn|Lincoln|2004|p=133}} Ancient biographies were concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject's reputation and memory, and also included [[propaganda]] and ''[[kerygma]]'' (preaching) in their works{{sfn|Dunn|2005|p=174}}\n\n===Synoptic problem and historicity===\n[[Image:MarkEvangelist.jpg|thumb|right|Mark the Evangelist, 16th-century Russian icon]]\nThe gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke bear a striking resemblance to each other, so much so that their contents can easily be set [[Gospel harmony#A parallel harmony presentation|side by side in parallel columns]]. The fact that they share so much material verbatim and yet also exhibit important differences has led to a number of hypotheses explaining their interdependence, a phenomenon termed the [[Synoptic  Problem]]. It is widely accepted that this was [[Marcan priority|the first gospel]] (Marcan Priority) and was used as a source by both Matthew and Luke, who agree with each other in their sequence of stories and events only when they also agree with Mark.{{sfn|Koester|2000|pp=44\u201346}}\n\nSince about 1950 there has been a growing consensus that the primary purpose of the author of Mark was to announce a message rather than to report history.{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=17}} The idea that the gospel could be used to reconstruct the historical Jesus suffered two severe blows in the early part of the 20th century, first when [[William Wrede]] argued strongly that the \"[[Messianic secret]]\" motif in Mark was a creation of the early church rather than a reflection of the historical Jesus, and in 1919 when Karl Ludwig Schmidt further undermined its historicity with his contention that the links between episodes are the invention of the writer, meaning that it cannot be taken as a reliable guide to the chronology of Jesus' mission: both claims are widely accepted today.{{sfn|Joel|2000|p=859}} The gospel is nevertheless still seen as the most reliable of the four in terms of its overall description of Jesus's life and ministry.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=37}}\n\n===Setting===\n[[File:Codex Alexandrinus list of kephalaia.JPG|right|thumb|180px|List of kephalaia (chapters) to the Gospel of Mark, placed after the kolophon of the Gospel of Matthew and before the Gospel of Mark, in [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (AD 400-440).]]\nChristianity began within [[Judaism]], with a Christian \"church\" (or \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, ''ekklesia'', meaning \"assembly\") that arose shortly after Jesus's death, when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead.{{sfn|L\u00f6ssl|2010|p=43}} From the outset, Christians depended heavily on [[Jewish literature]], supporting their convictions through the Jewish scriptures.{{sfn|Gamble|1995|p=23}} Those convictions involved a nucleus of key concepts: the messiah, the [[son of God]] and the [[son of man]], the [[suffering servant]], the [[Day of the Lord]], and the [[kingdom of God]]. Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that the end of history was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centre of his plans. Christians read the Jewish scripture as a figure or type of Jesus Christ, so that the goal of Christian literature became an experience of the living Christ.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=6}} The new movement spread around the eastern Mediterranean and to Rome and further west, and assumed a distinct identity, although the groups within it remained extremely diverse.{{sfn|L\u00f6ssl|2010|p=43}}\n\nThe gospels were written for an audience already Christian{{snd}}their purpose was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, not to convert unbelievers.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=59}} Christian \"churches\" were small communities of believers, often based on households (an autocratic patriarch plus extended family, slaves, freedmen, and other clients), and the evangelists often wrote on two levels, one the \"historical\" presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the author's own day.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=60}} Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew (\"kingdom of God\") and those of the early church (\"believe\", \"gospel\").{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=60}} More fundamentally, some scholars believe Mark's reason for writing was to counter believers who saw Jesus in a Greek way, as wonder-worker (the Greek term is \"divine man\"); Mark saw the suffering of the messiah as essential, so that the \"Son of God\" title (the Hellenistic \"divine man\") had to be corrected and amplified with the \"Son of Man\" title, which conveyed [[passion of Jesus|Christ's suffering]].{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=61}} Some scholars think Mark might have been writing as a Galilean Christian against those Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who saw the Jewish revolt against Rome (66\u201373 CE) as the beginning of the \"[[end time]]s\": for Mark, the Second Coming would be in Galilee, not Jerusalem, and not until the generation following the revolt.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=61}}\n\n==Structure and content==\n{{Content of Mark}}\n[[File:Mark Bib Lat 1486 c.2 Bodleian Library.jpg|thumbnail|left|Page from Mark in a Latin bible dated 1486 (Bodleian Library)]]\n\nThere is no agreement on the structure of Mark.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=68}} There is, however, a widely recognised break at {{bibleverse|Mark|8:26\u201331}}: before 8:26 there are numerous miracle stories, the action is in Galilee, and Jesus preaches to the crowds, while after 8:31 there are hardly any miracles, the action shifts from Galilee to gentile areas or hostile Judea, and Jesus teaches the disciples.{{sfn|Cole|1989|p=86}} Peter's confession at Mark 8:27\u201330 that Jesus is the messiah thus forms the watershed to the whole gospel.{{sfn|Cole|1989|pp=86\u201387}} A further generally recognised turning point comes at the end of chapter 10, when Jesus and his followers arrive in Jerusalem and the foreseen confrontation with the Temple authorities begins, leading [[R.T. France]] to characterise Mark as a three-act drama.{{sfn|France|2002|p=11}} James Edwards in his 2002 commentary points out that the gospel can be seen as a series of questions asking first who Jesus is (the answer being that he is the messiah), then what form his mission takes (a mission of suffering culminating in the crucifixion and resurrection, events only to be understood when the questions are answered), while another scholar, C. Myers, has made what Edwards calls a \"compelling case\" for recognising the incidents of Jesus' baptism, [[transfiguration of Christ|transfiguration]] and crucifixion, at the beginning, middle and end of the gospel, as three key moments, each with common elements, and each portrayed in an apocalyptic light.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=38\u201339}} Stephen H. Smith has made the point that the structure of Mark is similar to the structure of a [[Greek tragedy]].{{sfn|Smith|1995|pp=209\u201331}}\n\n===Content===\n* Jesus is first announced as the Messiah and then later as the Son of God; he is baptised by John and a heavenly voice announces him as the Son of God; he is tested in the wilderness by [[Satan]]; John is arrested, and Jesus begins to preach the good news of the [[kingdom of God]].\n* Jesus gathers his disciples; he begins teaching, driving out demons, healing the sick, cleansing lepers, raising the dead, feeding the hungry, and giving sight to the blind; he delivers a long discourse in [[parable]]s to the crowd, intended for the disciples, but they fail to understand; he performs mighty works, calming the storm and walking on water, but while God and demons recognise him, neither the crowds nor the disciples grasp his identity. He also has several run-ins with Jewish law keepers especially in chapters 2-3.\n* Jesus asks the disciples who people say he is, and then, \"but you, who do you say I am?\" Peter answers that he is the Christ, and Jesus commands him to silence; Jesus explains that the Son of Man must go to Jerusalem and be killed, but will rise again; [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] appear with Jesus and God tells the disciples, \"This is my son,\" but they remain uncomprehending.\n* Jesus goes to Jerusalem, where he is hailed as one who \"comes in the name of the Lord\" and will inaugurate the \"kingdom of David\"; he drives those who buy and sell animals from the Temple and debates with the Jewish authorities; on the Mount of Olives he announces the coming destruction of the Temple, the persecution of his followers, and the coming of the [[Son of Man]] in power and glory.\n* A woman perfumes Jesus' head with oil, and Jesus explains that this is a sign of his coming death; Jesus celebrates [[Passover]] with the disciples, declares the bread and wine to be his body and blood, and goes with them to [[Gethsemane]] to pray; there [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays him to the Jews; interrogated by the high priest, he says that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and will return as Son of Man at God's right hand; the Jewish leaders turn him over to [[Pilate]], who has him crucified as one who claims to be \"king of the Jews\"; Jesus, abandoned by the disciples, is buried in a rock tomb by a friendly member of the Jewish council.\n* The women who have followed Jesus come to the tomb on Sunday morning; they find it empty, and are told by a young man in a white robe to go and tell the others that Jesus has risen and has gone before them to Galilee; \"but they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid&nbsp;....\"{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=1\u20133}}\n===Ending===\n{{Details|Mark 16}}\nThe earliest and most reliable manuscripts of Mark end at {{bibleverse|Mark|16:8}}, with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb: the majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending,{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=500\u201301}} and this is supported by statements from the early Church Fathers Eusebius and Jerome.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6ter|2010|p=279}} Two attempts were made to provide a more satisfactory conclusion.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} A minority of later manuscripts have what is called the \"shorter ending\", an addition to {{bibleverse|Mark|16:8}} telling how the women told \"those around Peter\" all that the angel had commanded and how the message of eternal life (or \"proclamation of eternal salvation\") was then sent out by Jesus himself.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} This addition differs from the rest of Mark both in style and in its understanding of Jesus.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} The overwhelming majority of manuscripts have the \"longer ending\", {{bibleverse|Mark|16:9\u201320}}, with accounts of the resurrected Jesus, the commissioning of the disciples to proclaim the gospel, and Christ's ascension.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6ter|2010|p=279}} This ending was possibly written in the early 2nd century and added later in the same century.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}}\n\nModern scholars have proposed many explanations for the abrupt original ending, though none with universal acceptance. It could indicate a connection to the theme of the \"[[Messianic Secret]]\". Whatever the case, it is clear that Mark's Jesus looks forward to a post-death meeting in Galilee, and it is likely that at that meeting, like the final meeting in Galilee that Matthew depicts, Mark's Jesus would command the disciples to take his message to the nations.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=500}}\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|First page of the Gospel of Mark: \"''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''\", by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century)]]\n[[File:Archaic mark session.jpg|thumb|[[Minuscule 2427]]{{snd}}\"Archaic Mark\"]]\n\n===Gospel===\nThe author introduces his work as \"gospel\", meaning \"good news\", a literal translation of the Greek \"evangelion\"{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=17}}{{snd}}he uses the word more often than any other writer in the New Testament besides Paul.{{sfn|Morris|1990|p=95}} Paul uses it to mean \"the good news (of the saving significance of the death and resurrection) of Christ\"; Mark extends it to the career of Christ as well as his death and resurrection.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=17}} Like the other gospels, Mark was written to confirm the identity of Jesus as [[eschatology|eschatological deliverer]]{{snd}}the purpose of terms such as \"[[messiah]]\" and \"[[son of God]]\".{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=55}} As in all the gospels, the messianic identity of Jesus is supported by a number of themes, including: (1) the depiction of his disciples as obtuse, fearful and uncomprehending; (2) the refutation of the charge made by Jesus' enemies that he was a magician; (3) secrecy surrounding his true identity (this last is missing from John).{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=55}}\n\n===The failure of the disciples===\nIn Mark, the disciples, especially the Twelve, move from lack of perception of Jesus to rejection of the \"way of suffering\" to flight and denial{{snd}}even the women who received the first proclamation of his resurrection can be seen as failures for not reporting the good news. There is much discussion of this theme among scholars. Some argue that the author of Mark was using the disciples to correct \"erroneous\" views in his own community concerning the reality of the suffering messiah, others that it is an attack on the Jerusalem branch of the church for resisting the extension of the gospel to the gentiles, or a mirror of the convert's usual experience of the initial enthusiasm followed by growing awareness of the necessity for suffering. It certainly reflects the strong theme in Mark of Jesus as the \"suffering just one\" portrayed in so many of the books of the Jewish scriptures, from Jeremiah to Job and the Psalms, but especially in the \"[[Suffering Servant]]\" passages in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]. It also reflects the Jewish scripture theme of God's love being met by infidelity and failure, only to be renewed by God. And in the real-world context in which the gospel was written, the persecutions of the Christians of Rome under Nero{{check|date=February 2019}}, the failure of the disciples and Jesus' denial by Peter himself would have been powerful symbols of faith, hope and reconciliation.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n===The charge of magic===\nMark contains twenty accounts of miracles and healings, accounting for almost a third of the gospel and half the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=57}} In the gospels as a whole, Jesus' miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of God's rule, but Mark's descriptions of Jesus' healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using spittle to heal blindness (Mark 8:22\u201326) and magic formulae (\"Talitha cumi,\" 5:41, \"Ephphatha,\" 7:34), were those of a magician.{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=483}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=57}} This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: they say he is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit (Mark 3:22) and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14).{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=483}} \"There was&nbsp;... no period in the history of the [Roman] empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society,\" subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen.{{sfn|Welch|2006|p=362}} All the gospels defend Jesus against the charge, which, if true, would contradict their ultimate claims for him.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=56}} The point of the [[Beelzebub]] incident in Mark (Mark 3:20\u201330) is to set forth Jesus' claims to be an instrument of God, not Satan.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=56}}\n\n===Messianic secret===\n{{main|Messianic secret}}\nIn 1901, [[William Wrede]] identified the \"Messianic secret\"{{snd}}Jesus' secrecy about his identity as the messiah{{snd}}as one of Mark's central themes. Wrede argued that the elements of the secret{{snd}}Jesus' silencing of the demons, the obtuseness of the disciples regarding his identity, and the concealment of the truth inside parables{{snd}}were fictions and arose from the tension between the Church's post-resurrection messianic belief and the historical reality of Jesus. There remains continuing debate over how far the \"secret\" originated with Mark and how far he got it from tradition, and how far, if at all, it represents the self-understanding and practices of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=1083}}\n\n===Christology===\n{{see also|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}\n[[Christology]] means a doctrine or understanding concerning the person or nature of Christ.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=3}} In the New Testament writings it is frequently conveyed through the titles applied to Jesus. Most scholars agree that \"Son of God\" is the most important of these titles in Mark.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} It appears on the lips of God himself at the [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], and is Jesus' own self-designation (Mark 13:32).{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} These and other instances provide reliable evidence of how the evangelist perceived Jesus, but it is not clear just what the title meant to Mark and his 1st century audience.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Where it appears in the Hebrew scriptures it meant Israel as God's people, or the king at his coronation, or angels, as well as the suffering righteous man.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|p=25}} In Hellenistic culture the same phrase meant a \"divine man\", a supernatural being.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} There is little evidence that \"son of God\" was a title for the messiah in 1st century Judaism, and the attributes which Mark describes in Jesus are much more those of the Hellenistic miracle-working \"divine man\" than of the Jewish Davidic messiah.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nMark does not explicitly state what he means by \"Son of God\", nor when the sonship was conferred.{{sfn|Ehrman|1993|p=74}} The New Testament as a whole presents four different understandings:\n# Jesus became God's son at his resurrection, God \"begetting\" Jesus to a new life by raising him from the dead{{snd}}this was the earliest understanding, preserved in Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]], 1:3\u20134, and in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 13:33;\n# Jesus became God's son at his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]], the coming of the [[Holy Spirit]] marking him as messiah, while \"Son of God\" refers to the relationship then established for him by God{{snd}}this is the understanding implied in {{bibleverse|Mark|1:9\u201311}};\n# Matthew and Luke present Jesus as \"Son of God\" from the moment of conception and birth, with God taking the place of a human father;\n# John, the last of the gospels, presents the idea that the Christ was pre-existent and became flesh as Jesus{{snd}}an idea also found in Paul.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nMark also calls Jesus \"christos\" (Christ), translating the Hebrew \"messiah,\" (anointed person).{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=25\u201326}} In the Old Testament the term messiah (\"anointed one\") described prophets, priests and kings; by the time of Jesus, with the kingdom long vanished, it had come to mean an [[eschatology|eschatological king]] (a king who would come at the end of time), one who would be entirely human though far greater than all God's previous messengers to Israel, endowed with miraculous powers, free from sin, ruling in justice and glory (as described in, for example, the [[Psalms of Solomon]], a Jewish work from this period).{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=250}} The most important occurrences are in the context of Jesus' death and suffering, suggesting that, for Mark, Jesus can only be fully understood in that context.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nA third important title, \"[[Son of Man]]\", has its roots in [[book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], the [[Book of Enoch]], (a popular Jewish apocalyptic work of the period), and especially in [[Daniel 7]]:13\u201314, where the Son of Man is assigned royal roles of dominion, kingship and glory.{{sfn|Witherington|2001|p=51}}{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=26\u201327}} Mark 14:62 combines more scriptural allusions: before he comes on clouds (Daniel 7:13) the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God (Psalm 110:1), pointing to the equivalence of the three titles, Christ, Son of God, Son of Man, the common element being the reference to kingly power.{{sfn|Witherington|2001|p=52}}\n\n===Christ's death, resurrection and return===\n[[Eschatology]] means the study of the end-times, and the Jews expected the [[messiah]] to be an [[eschatology|eschatological]] figure, a deliverer who would appear at the end of the age to usher in an earthly kingdom.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=69}} The earliest Jewish Christian community saw Jesus as a [[messiah]] in this Jewish sense, a human figure appointed by God as his earthly regent; but they also believed in Jesus' resurrection and exaltation to heaven, and for this reason they also viewed him as God's agent (the \"son of God\") who would return in glory ushering in the [[Kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}}\n\nThe term \"[[Son of God]]\" likewise had a specific Jewish meaning, or range of meanings,{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=709\u201310}} one of the most significant being the earthly king adopted by God as his son at his enthronement, legitimising his rule over Israel.{{sfn|Strecker|2000|pp=81\u201382}} In Hellenistic culture, in contrast, the phrase meant a \"divine man\", covering legendary heroes like [[Hercules]], god-kings like the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s, or famous philosophers like [[Plato]].{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=69}} When the gospels call Jesus \"Son of God\" the intention is to place him in the class of Hellenistic and Greek divine men, the 'sons of God\" who were endowed with supernatural power to perform healings, exorcisms and other wonderful deeds.{{sfn|Strecker|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Mark's \"Son of David\" is Hellenistic, his Jesus predicting that his mission involves suffering, death and resurrection, and, by implication, not military glory and conquest.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=52}} This reflects a move away from the Jewish-Christian apocalyptic tradition and towards the Hellenistic message preached by Paul, for whom Christ's death and resurrection, rather than the establishment of the apocalyptic Jewish kingdom, is the meaning of salvation, the \"gospel\".{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}}\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\n[[File:PericopesHenryIIFol117rAngelOnTomb.jpg|thumb|''\"Entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment\"''{{snd}}Mark's description of the discovery of the empty tomb (from the [[Pericopes of Henry II]])]]\n\n===Mark and the New Testament===\nAll four gospels tell a story in which Jesus' death and resurrection are the crucial redemptive events.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=587}} There are, however, important differences between the four: Unlike [[Gospel of John|John]], Mark never calls Jesus \"God\", or claims that Jesus existed prior to his earthly life;{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}} unlike [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the author does not mention a virgin birth, and apparently believes that Jesus had a normal human parentage and birth;{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}} unlike Matthew and Luke, he makes no attempt to trace Jesus' ancestry back to [[King David]] or [[Adam]] with a genealogy.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}}\n\nChristians of Mark's time expected Jesus to return as Messiah in their own lifetime{{snd}}Mark, like the other gospels, attributes the promise to Jesus himself (Mark 9:1 and 13:30), and it is reflected in the letters of [[apostle Paul|Paul]], in the [[epistle of James]], in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], and in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. When return failed, the early Christians revised their understanding. Some acknowledged that the [[Second Coming]] had been delayed, but still expected it; others redefined the focus of the promise, the [[Gospel of John]], for example, speaking of \"eternal life\" as something available in the present; while still others concluded that Jesus would not return at all ([[2 Peter]] argues against those who held this view).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nMark's despairing death of Jesus was changed to a more victorious one in subsequent gospels.{{sfn|Moyise|2013|p=unpaginated}} Mark's Christ dies with the cry, \"[[My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?]]\"; Matthew, the next gospel to be written, repeats this word for word but manages to make clear that Jesus's death is the beginning of the resurrection of Israel; Luke has a still more positive picture, replacing Mark's (and Matthew's) cry of despair with one of submission to God's will (\"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"); while John, the last gospel, has Jesus dying without apparent suffering in fulfillment of the divine plan.{{sfn|Moyise|2013|p=unpaginated}}\n\n===Content unique to Mark===\n[[File:San Marco cathedral in Venice.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] with angels, holding his gospel.

It tells of the [[ministry of Jesus]] from his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] by [[John the Baptist]] to his death and burial and the discovery of the [[empty tomb]]{{snd}}there is no [[genealogy of Jesus]] or birth narrative, nor, in the original ending at [[Mark 16|chapter 16]], any [[post-resurrection appearances of Jesus]]. It portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action, an [[Exorcism|exorcist]], a healer, and a miracle worker. Jesus is also the [[Son of God]], but he keeps his identity secret (the [[Messianic Secret]]), concealing it in [[parables]] so that even most of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] fail to understand. All this is in keeping with prophecy, which foretold the fate of the [[messiah]] as [[suffering servant]].{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=252\u201353}} The gospel ends, in its original version, with the discovery of the empty tomb, a promise to meet again in Galilee, and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the [[resurrection of Christ|resurrection]].{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nMost scholars date Mark to AD 65-75.{{sfn|Perkins|2007|p=137}} They reject the traditional ascription to [[Mark the Evangelist]], the companion of the [[Apostle Peter]], which probably arose from the desire of early Christians to link the work to an authoritative figure, and believe it to be the work of an author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=156}} It was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as an inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel, [[gospel of Matthew|Matthew]].{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=2}} The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from [[gospel of John|John]], and only distantly from Mark.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=1\u20133}} It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and [[gospel of Luke|Luke]].{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=1\u20133}} The hypothesis of [[Marcan priority]] (that Mark was written first) continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering [[Son of God]].{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n==Composition, genre, and setting==\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna 087.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]]]]\n[[File:Synoptic problem, two-source hypothesis.svg|thumb|The two-source hypothesis: Most scholars agree that Mark was the first of the gospels to be composed, and that the authors of Matthew and Luke used it plus a second document called the [[Q source]] when composing their own gospels. The blue sections indicate material original to Luke and Matthew.]]\n\n===Authorship and genre===\nThe Gospel of Mark is anonymous.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=63\u201364}} It was written in Greek for a gentile audience, probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have also been suggested.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=157}} Early Christian tradition attributes it to the John Mark mentioned in Acts, but scholars generally reject this as an attempt to link the gospel to an authoritative figure.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=156}} It was probably written c. AD 66\u201370, during [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians in Rome or the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish revolt]], as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.{{sfn|Perkins|2007|p=241}} The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1\u20133:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (13:1\u201337), and collections of sayings (although not the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]]).{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13\u201314}} Scholars accept that parts of Mark, such as the Passion Narrative, date as early as AD 40. {{sfn|Charlesworth|2013|p=118}}\n\nThe consensus among modern scholars is that the gospels are a subset of the ancient genre of ''bios'', or [[ancient biography]].{{sfn|Lincoln|2004|p=133}} Ancient biographies were concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject's reputation and memory, and also included [[propaganda]] and ''[[kerygma]]'' (preaching) in their works{{sfn|Dunn|2005|p=174}}\n\n===Synoptic problem and historicity===\n[[Image:MarkEvangelist.jpg|thumb|right|Mark the Evangelist, 16th-century Russian icon]]\nThe gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke bear a striking resemblance to each other, so much so that their contents can easily be set [[Gospel harmony#A parallel harmony presentation|side by side in parallel columns]]. The fact that they share so much material verbatim and yet also exhibit important differences has led to a number of hypotheses explaining their interdependence, a phenomenon termed the [[Synoptic  Problem]]. It is widely accepted that this was [[Marcan priority|the first gospel]] (Marcan Priority) and was used as a source by both Matthew and Luke, who agree with each other in their sequence of stories and events only when they also agree with Mark.{{sfn|Koester|2000|pp=44\u201346}}\n\nSince about 1950 there has been a growing consensus that the primary purpose of the author of Mark was to announce a message rather than to report history.{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=17}} The idea that the gospel could be used to reconstruct the historical Jesus suffered two severe blows in the early part of the 20th century, first when [[William Wrede]] argued strongly that the \"[[Messianic secret]]\" motif in Mark was a creation of the early church rather than a reflection of the historical Jesus, and in 1919 when Karl Ludwig Schmidt further undermined its historicity with his contention that the links between episodes are the invention of the writer, meaning that it cannot be taken as a reliable guide to the chronology of Jesus' mission: both claims are widely accepted today.{{sfn|Joel|2000|p=859}} The gospel is nevertheless still seen as the most reliable of the four in terms of its overall description of Jesus's life and ministry.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=37}}\n\n===Setting===\n[[File:Codex Alexandrinus list of kephalaia.JPG|right|thumb|180px|List of kephalaia (chapters) to the Gospel of Mark, placed after the kolophon of the Gospel of Matthew and before the Gospel of Mark, in [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (AD 400-440).]]\nChristianity began within [[Judaism]], with a Christian \"church\" (or \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, ''ekklesia'', meaning \"assembly\") that arose shortly after Jesus's death, when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead.{{sfn|L\u00f6ssl|2010|p=43}} From the outset, Christians depended heavily on [[Jewish literature]], supporting their convictions through the Jewish scriptures.{{sfn|Gamble|1995|p=23}} Those convictions involved a nucleus of key concepts: the messiah, the [[son of God]] and the [[son of man]], the [[suffering servant]], the [[Day of the Lord]], and the [[kingdom of God]]. Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that the end of history was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centre of his plans. Christians read the Jewish scripture as a figure or type of Jesus Christ, so that the goal of Christian literature became an experience of the living Christ.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=6}} The new movement spread around the eastern Mediterranean and to Rome and further west, and assumed a distinct identity, although the groups within it remained extremely diverse.{{sfn|L\u00f6ssl|2010|p=43}}\n\nThe gospels were written for an audience already Christian{{snd}}their purpose was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, not to convert unbelievers.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=59}} Christian \"churches\" were small communities of believers, often based on households (an autocratic patriarch plus extended family, slaves, freedmen, and other clients), and the evangelists often wrote on two levels, one the \"historical\" presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the author's own day.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=60}} Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew (\"kingdom of God\") and those of the early church (\"believe\", \"gospel\").{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=60}} More fundamentally, some scholars believe Mark's reason for writing was to counter believers who saw Jesus in a Greek way, as wonder-worker (the Greek term is \"divine man\"); Mark saw the suffering of the messiah as essential, so that the \"Son of God\" title (the Hellenistic \"divine man\") had to be corrected and amplified with the \"Son of Man\" title, which conveyed [[passion of Jesus|Christ's suffering]].{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=61}} Some scholars think Mark might have been writing as a Galilean Christian against those Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who saw the Jewish revolt against Rome (66\u201373 CE) as the beginning of the \"[[end time]]s\": for Mark, the Second Coming would be in Galilee, not Jerusalem, and not until the generation following the revolt.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=61}}\n\n==Structure and content==\n{{Content of Mark}}\n[[File:Mark Bib Lat 1486 c.2 Bodleian Library.jpg|thumbnail|left|Page from Mark in a Latin bible dated 1486 (Bodleian Library)]]\n\nThere is no agreement on the structure of Mark.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=68}} There is, however, a widely recognised break at {{bibleverse|Mark|8:26\u201331}}: before 8:26 there are numerous miracle stories, the action is in Galilee, and Jesus preaches to the crowds, while after 8:31 there are hardly any miracles, the action shifts from Galilee to gentile areas or hostile Judea, and Jesus teaches the disciples.{{sfn|Cole|1989|p=86}} Peter's confession at Mark 8:27\u201330 that Jesus is the messiah thus forms the watershed to the whole gospel.{{sfn|Cole|1989|pp=86\u201387}} A further generally recognised turning point comes at the end of chapter 10, when Jesus and his followers arrive in Jerusalem and the foreseen confrontation with the Temple authorities begins, leading [[R.T. France]] to characterise Mark as a three-act drama.{{sfn|France|2002|p=11}} James Edwards in his 2002 commentary points out that the gospel can be seen as a series of questions asking first who Jesus is (the answer being that he is the messiah), then what form his mission takes (a mission of suffering culminating in the crucifixion and resurrection, events only to be understood when the questions are answered), while another scholar, C. Myers, has made what Edwards calls a \"compelling case\" for recognising the incidents of Jesus' baptism, [[transfiguration of Christ|transfiguration]] and crucifixion, at the beginning, middle and end of the gospel, as three key moments, each with common elements, and each portrayed in an apocalyptic light.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=38\u201339}} Stephen H. Smith has made the point that the structure of Mark is similar to the structure of a [[Greek tragedy]].{{sfn|Smith|1995|pp=209\u201331}}\n\n===Content===\n* Jesus is first announced as the Messiah and then later as the Son of God; he is baptised by John and a heavenly voice announces him as the Son of God; he is tested in the wilderness by [[Satan]]; John is arrested, and Jesus begins to preach the good news of the [[kingdom of God]].\n* Jesus gathers his disciples; he begins teaching, driving out demons, healing the sick, cleansing lepers, raising the dead, feeding the hungry, and giving sight to the blind; he delivers a long discourse in [[parable]]s to the crowd, intended for the disciples, but they fail to understand; he performs mighty works, calming the storm and walking on water, but while God and demons recognise him, neither the crowds nor the disciples grasp his identity. He also has several run-ins with Jewish law keepers especially in chapters 2-3.\n* Jesus asks the disciples who people say he is, and then, \"but you, who do you say I am?\" Peter answers that he is the Christ, and Jesus commands him to silence; Jesus explains that the Son of Man must go to Jerusalem and be killed, but will rise again; [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] appear with Jesus and God tells the disciples, \"This is my son,\" but they remain uncomprehending.\n* Jesus goes to Jerusalem, where he is hailed as one who \"comes in the name of the Lord\" and will inaugurate the \"kingdom of David\"; he drives those who buy and sell animals from the Temple and debates with the Jewish authorities; on the Mount of Olives he announces the coming destruction of the Temple, the persecution of his followers, and the coming of the [[Son of Man]] in power and glory.\n* A woman perfumes Jesus' head with oil, and Jesus explains that this is a sign of his coming death; Jesus celebrates [[Passover]] with the disciples, declares the bread and wine to be his body and blood, and goes with them to [[Gethsemane]] to pray; there [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays him to the Jews; interrogated by the high priest, he says that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and will return as Son of Man at God's right hand; the Jewish leaders turn him over to [[Pilate]], who has him crucified as one who claims to be \"king of the Jews\"; Jesus, abandoned by the disciples, is buried in a rock tomb by a friendly member of the Jewish council.\n* The women who have followed Jesus come to the tomb on Sunday morning; they find it empty, and are told by a young man in a white robe to go and tell the others that Jesus has risen and has gone before them to Galilee; \"but they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid&nbsp;....\"{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=1\u20133}}\n===Ending===\n{{Details|Mark 16}}\nThe earliest and most reliable manuscripts of Mark end at {{bibleverse|Mark|16:8}}, with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb: the majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending,{{sfn|Edwards|2002|pp=500\u201301}} and this is supported by statements from the early Church Fathers Eusebius and Jerome.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6ter|2010|p=279}} Two attempts were made to provide a more satisfactory conclusion.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} A minority of later manuscripts have what is called the \"shorter ending\", an addition to {{bibleverse|Mark|16:8}} telling how the women told \"those around Peter\" all that the angel had commanded and how the message of eternal life (or \"proclamation of eternal salvation\") was then sent out by Jesus himself.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} This addition differs from the rest of Mark both in style and in its understanding of Jesus.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}} The overwhelming majority of manuscripts have the \"longer ending\", {{bibleverse|Mark|16:9\u201320}}, with accounts of the resurrected Jesus, the commissioning of the disciples to proclaim the gospel, and Christ's ascension.{{sfn|Schr\u00f6ter|2010|p=279}} This ending was possibly written in the early 2nd century and added later in the same century.{{sfn|Horsely|2007|p=91}}\n\nModern scholars have proposed many explanations for the abrupt original ending, though none with universal acceptance. It could indicate a connection to the theme of the \"[[Messianic Secret]]\". Whatever the case, it is clear that Mark's Jesus looks forward to a post-death meeting in Galilee, and it is likely that at that meeting, like the final meeting in Galilee that Matthew depicts, Mark's Jesus would command the disciples to take his message to the nations.{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=500}}\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|First page of the Gospel of Mark: \"''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''\", by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century)]]\n[[File:Archaic mark session.jpg|thumb|[[Minuscule 2427]]{{snd}}\"Archaic Mark\"]]\n\n===Gospel===\nThe author introduces his work as \"gospel\", meaning \"good news\", a literal translation of the Greek \"evangelion\"{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=17}}{{snd}}he uses the word more often than any other writer in the New Testament besides Paul.{{sfn|Morris|1990|p=95}} Paul uses it to mean \"the good news (of the saving significance of the death and resurrection) of Christ\"; Mark extends it to the career of Christ as well as his death and resurrection.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=17}} Like the other gospels, Mark was written to confirm the identity of Jesus as [[eschatology|eschatological deliverer]]{{snd}}the purpose of terms such as \"[[messiah]]\" and \"[[son of God]]\".{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=55}} As in all the gospels, the messianic identity of Jesus is supported by a number of themes, including: (1) the depiction of his disciples as obtuse, fearful and uncomprehending; (2) the refutation of the charge made by Jesus' enemies that he was a magician; (3) secrecy surrounding his true identity (this last is missing from John).{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=55}}\n\n===The failure of the disciples===\nIn Mark, the disciples, especially the Twelve, move from lack of perception of Jesus to rejection of the \"way of suffering\" to flight and denial{{snd}}even the women who received the first proclamation of his resurrection can be seen as failures for not reporting the good news. There is much discussion of this theme among scholars. Some argue that the author of Mark was using the disciples to correct \"erroneous\" views in his own community concerning the reality of the suffering messiah, others that it is an attack on the Jerusalem branch of the church for resisting the extension of the gospel to the gentiles, or a mirror of the convert's usual experience of the initial enthusiasm followed by growing awareness of the necessity for suffering. It certainly reflects the strong theme in Mark of Jesus as the \"suffering just one\" portrayed in so many of the books of the Jewish scriptures, from Jeremiah to Job and the Psalms, but especially in the \"[[Suffering Servant]]\" passages in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]. It also reflects the Jewish scripture theme of God's love being met by infidelity and failure, only to be renewed by God. And in the real-world context in which the gospel was written, the persecutions of the Christians of Rome under Nero{{check|date=February 2019}}, the failure of the disciples and Jesus' denial by Peter himself would have been powerful symbols of faith, hope and reconciliation.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n===The charge of magic===\nMark contains twenty accounts of miracles and healings, accounting for almost a third of the gospel and half the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel.{{sfn|Twelftree|1999|p=57}} In the gospels as a whole, Jesus' miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of God's rule, but Mark's descriptions of Jesus' healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using spittle to heal blindness (Mark 8:22\u201326) and magic formulae (\"Talitha cumi,\" 5:41, \"Ephphatha,\" 7:34), were those of a magician.{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=483}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=57}} This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: they say he is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit (Mark 3:22) and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14).{{sfn|Kee|1993|p=483}} \"There was&nbsp;... no period in the history of the [Roman] empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society,\" subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen.{{sfn|Welch|2006|p=362}} All the gospels defend Jesus against the charge, which, if true, would contradict their ultimate claims for him.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=56}} The point of the [[Beelzebub]] incident in Mark (Mark 3:20\u201330) is to set forth Jesus' claims to be an instrument of God, not Satan.{{sfn|Aune|1987|p=56}}\n\n===Messianic secret===\n{{main|Messianic secret}}\nIn 1901, [[William Wrede]] identified the \"Messianic secret\"{{snd}}Jesus' secrecy about his identity as the messiah{{snd}}as one of Mark's central themes. Wrede argued that the elements of the secret{{snd}}Jesus' silencing of the demons, the obtuseness of the disciples regarding his identity, and the concealment of the truth inside parables{{snd}}were fictions and arose from the tension between the Church's post-resurrection messianic belief and the historical reality of Jesus. There remains continuing debate over how far the \"secret\" originated with Mark and how far he got it from tradition, and how far, if at all, it represents the self-understanding and practices of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=1083}}\n\n===Christology===\n{{see also|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}\n[[Christology]] means a doctrine or understanding concerning the person or nature of Christ.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=3}} In the New Testament writings it is frequently conveyed through the titles applied to Jesus. Most scholars agree that \"Son of God\" is the most important of these titles in Mark.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} It appears on the lips of God himself at the [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], and is Jesus' own self-designation (Mark 13:32).{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} These and other instances provide reliable evidence of how the evangelist perceived Jesus, but it is not clear just what the title meant to Mark and his 1st century audience.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Where it appears in the Hebrew scriptures it meant Israel as God's people, or the king at his coronation, or angels, as well as the suffering righteous man.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|p=25}} In Hellenistic culture the same phrase meant a \"divine man\", a supernatural being.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}} There is little evidence that \"son of God\" was a title for the messiah in 1st century Judaism, and the attributes which Mark describes in Jesus are much more those of the Hellenistic miracle-working \"divine man\" than of the Jewish Davidic messiah.{{sfn|Telford|1999|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nMark does not explicitly state what he means by \"Son of God\", nor when the sonship was conferred.{{sfn|Ehrman|1993|p=74}} The New Testament as a whole presents four different understandings:\n# Jesus became God's son at his resurrection, God \"begetting\" Jesus to a new life by raising him from the dead{{snd}}this was the earliest understanding, preserved in Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]], 1:3\u20134, and in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 13:33;\n# Jesus became God's son at his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]], the coming of the [[Holy Spirit]] marking him as messiah, while \"Son of God\" refers to the relationship then established for him by God{{snd}}this is the understanding implied in {{bibleverse|Mark|1:9\u201311}};\n# Matthew and Luke present Jesus as \"Son of God\" from the moment of conception and birth, with God taking the place of a human father;\n# John, the last of the gospels, presents the idea that the Christ was pre-existent and became flesh as Jesus{{snd}}an idea also found in Paul.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nMark also calls Jesus \"christos\" (Christ), translating the Hebrew \"messiah,\" (anointed person).{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=25\u201326}} In the Old Testament the term messiah (\"anointed one\") described prophets, priests and kings; by the time of Jesus, with the kingdom long vanished, it had come to mean an [[eschatology|eschatological king]] (a king who would come at the end of time), one who would be entirely human though far greater than all God's previous messengers to Israel, endowed with miraculous powers, free from sin, ruling in justice and glory (as described in, for example, the [[Psalms of Solomon]], a Jewish work from this period).{{sfn|Edwards|2002|p=250}} The most important occurrences are in the context of Jesus' death and suffering, suggesting that, for Mark, Jesus can only be fully understood in that context.{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nA third important title, \"[[Son of Man]]\", has its roots in [[book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], the [[Book of Enoch]], (a popular Jewish apocalyptic work of the period), and especially in [[Daniel 7]]:13\u201314, where the Son of Man is assigned royal roles of dominion, kingship and glory.{{sfn|Witherington|2001|p=51}}{{sfn|Donahue|2005|pp=26\u201327}} Mark 14:62 combines more scriptural allusions: before he comes on clouds (Daniel 7:13) the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God (Psalm 110:1), pointing to the equivalence of the three titles, Christ, Son of God, Son of Man, the common element being the reference to kingly power.{{sfn|Witherington|2001|p=52}}\n\n===Christ's death, resurrection and return===\n[[Eschatology]] means the study of the end-times, and the Jews expected the [[messiah]] to be an [[eschatology|eschatological]] figure, a deliverer who would appear at the end of the age to usher in an earthly kingdom.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=69}} The earliest Jewish Christian community saw Jesus as a [[messiah]] in this Jewish sense, a human figure appointed by God as his earthly regent; but they also believed in Jesus' resurrection and exaltation to heaven, and for this reason they also viewed him as God's agent (the \"son of God\") who would return in glory ushering in the [[Kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}}\n\nThe term \"[[Son of God]]\" likewise had a specific Jewish meaning, or range of meanings,{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=709\u201310}} one of the most significant being the earthly king adopted by God as his son at his enthronement, legitimising his rule over Israel.{{sfn|Strecker|2000|pp=81\u201382}} In Hellenistic culture, in contrast, the phrase meant a \"divine man\", covering legendary heroes like [[Hercules]], god-kings like the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s, or famous philosophers like [[Plato]].{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=69}} When the gospels call Jesus \"Son of God\" the intention is to place him in the class of Hellenistic and Greek divine men, the 'sons of God\" who were endowed with supernatural power to perform healings, exorcisms and other wonderful deeds.{{sfn|Strecker|2000|pp=81\u201382}} Mark's \"Son of David\" is Hellenistic, his Jesus predicting that his mission involves suffering, death and resurrection, and, by implication, not military glory and conquest.{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=52}} This reflects a move away from the Jewish-Christian apocalyptic tradition and towards the Hellenistic message preached by Paul, for whom Christ's death and resurrection, rather than the establishment of the apocalyptic Jewish kingdom, is the meaning of salvation, the \"gospel\".{{sfn|Telford|1999|p=155}}\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\n[[File:PericopesHenryIIFol117rAngelOnTomb.jpg|thumb|''\"Entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment\"''{{snd}}Mark's description of the discovery of the empty tomb (from the [[Pericopes of Henry II]])]]\n\n===Mark and the New Testament===\nAll four gospels tell a story in which Jesus' death and resurrection are the crucial redemptive events.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=587}} There are, however, important differences between the four: Unlike [[Gospel of John|John]], Mark never calls Jesus \"God\", or claims that Jesus existed prior to his earthly life;{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}} unlike [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the author does not mention a virgin birth, and apparently believes that Jesus had a normal human parentage and birth;{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}} unlike Matthew and Luke, he makes no attempt to trace Jesus' ancestry back to [[King David]] or [[Adam]] with a genealogy.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=158}}\n\nChristians of Mark's time expected Jesus to return as Messiah in their own lifetime{{snd}}Mark, like the other gospels, attributes the promise to Jesus himself (Mark 9:1 and 13:30), and it is reflected in the letters of [[apostle Paul|Paul]], in the [[epistle of James]], in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], and in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. When return failed, the early Christians revised their understanding. Some acknowledged that the [[Second Coming]] had been delayed, but still expected it; others redefined the focus of the promise, the [[Gospel of John]], for example, speaking of \"eternal life\" as something available in the present; while still others concluded that Jesus would not return at all ([[2 Peter]] argues against those who held this view).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nMark's despairing death of Jesus was changed to a more victorious one in subsequent gospels.{{sfn|Moyise|2013|p=unpaginated}} Mark's Christ dies with the cry, \"[[My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?]]\"; Matthew, the next gospel to be written, repeats this word for word but manages to make clear that Jesus's death is the beginning of the resurrection of Israel; Luke has a still more positive picture, replacing Mark's (and Matthew's) cry of despair with one of submission to God's will (\"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"); while John, the last gospel, has Jesus dying without apparent suffering in fulfillment of the divine plan.{{sfn|Moyise|2013|p=unpaginated}}\n\n===Content unique to Mark===\n[[File:San Marco cathedral in Venice.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] with angels, holding his gospel.

In the early 20th century, the largest cave was used for dances, but sand has since drifted into the cave and the dance floor is now covered by five metres of sand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jasons.co.nz/auckland/auckland-beaches|title=Auckland Beaches |publisher=[[Jasons Travel Media]]}}</ref> During the timber mill era, the larger caves were also a popular venue for meetings for mill workers.<ref>[http://www.theaucklander.co.nz/news/best-auckland-parks/1217377/  7 super Auckland parks to visit this summer] Retrieved January 2012</ref>\n\n==Historic Industry==\nA timber mill was built at Whatipu in 1867 to service the [[Agathis australis|kauri]] trade. A tramline was built to a second timber mill three kilometers north in 1870, and eventually extended up to [[Piha]] and [[Anawhata]]. The mills closed in 1886 when the kauri ran out.\n\n==Whatipu-Gibbons Track & Kura-Omanawanui Tracks==\nAt 6-hours return, the route for this track begins at the carpark at Whatipu. It leads up the hill to the right of the carpark and is clearly marked.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} It follows the top of the cliffs to the Pararaha Valley where it descends to the beach at Pararaha point. It then follows the beach back to Whatipu. Paratutae Rock at the harbour entrance is difficult and particularly dangerous to climb down.<ref>Day Walks of Greater Auckland, Marios Gavalas and Peter Jansson, Page 68.

In the episode \"[[Telethon (Parks and Recreation)|Telethon]]\", his name is misspelled as \"Gerry Grgich\" on the television. From the season 6 episode \"[[Doppelg\u00e4ngers (Parks and Recreation)|Doppelg\u00e4ngers]]\" everyone starts calling him \"Larry Gengurch\" at the encouragement of April, a situation \"Larry\" meekly accepts with little protest.

In the season 7 episode \"[[Donna and Joe (Parks and Recreation)|Donna and Joe]]\", Donna puts his name down as \"Garry\" on a seating placard at her wedding, which prompts April to begin calling him Garry, his actual name.

For most of the series run he is known as \"Jerry Gergich\". In season four, it is twice stated that Jerry's real name is Garry, but since his first boss misheard him, he goes by Jerry. In the episode \"[[Telethon (Parks and Recreation)|Telethon]]\", his name is misspelled as \"Gerry Grgich\" on the television. From the season 6 episode \"[[Doppelg\u00e4ngers (Parks and Recreation)|Doppelg\u00e4ngers]]\" everyone starts calling him \"Larry Gengurch\" at the encouragement of April, a situation \"Larry\" meekly accepts with little protest. In \"[[Ann and Chris]]\", the men of the department give [[Chris Traeger|Chris]] a gift with their initials on it. Jerry signed it GJLGG which he said stood for \"Garry Jerry Larry Gergich Gengurch\" as he wasn't sure what names to use.\n\nFollowing the time jump to 2017 at the end of \"[[Moving Up (Parks and Recreation)|Moving Up]]\", he goes by the name of \"Terry\" - an explanation is given during the season 7 episode \"[[2017 (Parks and Recreation)|2017]]\" that a new employee that works in the National Park Service also goes by Larry and the group changes his name to Terry. In the season 7 episode \"[[Donna and Joe (Parks and Recreation)|Donna and Joe]]\", Donna puts his name down as \"Garry\" on a seating placard at her wedding, which prompts April to begin calling him Garry, his actual name. Throughout season 7, he also appears on [[Andy Dwyer|Andy]]'s television show ''The Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show'', playing a character named Mailman Barry.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation/about/bios/jim-oheir/ Jim O'Heir biography at official ''Parks and Recreation'' site] at [[NBC|NBC.com]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170314000510/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0200318/ Jerry Gergich] on [[IMDb]]\n\n{{Parks and Recreation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gergich, Jerry Gerry Larry}}\n[[Category:Parks and Recreation characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional artists]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Fictional civil servants]]\n[[Category:Fictional mayors]]\n", "name_user": "2601:244:5100:a0:408e:e661:8924:9682", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Gergich"}

Derived from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word \u1f00\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, ''anonymia'', meaning \"without a [[name]]\" or \"namelessness\"}} describes situations where the acting person's name is unknown. Some writers have argued that namelessness, though technically correct, does not capture what is more centrally at stake in contexts of anonymity. The important idea here is that a person be non-identifiable, unreachable, or untrackable.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = Kathleen A | year = 1999 | title = Anonymity | url = | journal = Ethics and Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 23\u201335 | doi = 10.1023/A:1010066509278 }}; {{cite journal | last1 = Nissenbaum | first1 = Helen | year = 1999 | title = The Meaning of Anonymity in an Information Age | url = | journal = The Information Society | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 141\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/019722499128592 }}; {{cite journal | last1 = Matthews | first1 = Steve | year = 2010 | title = Anonymity and the Social Self | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 351\u201363 }}</ref> Anonymity is seen as a technique, or a way of realizing, a certain other values, such as [[privacy]], or liberty.\n\nAn important example for anonymity being not only protected, but enforced by law is the vote in [[Secret ballot|free elections]]. In many other situations (like conversation between strangers, buying some product or service in a shop), anonymity is traditionally accepted as natural. There are also various situations in which a person might choose to withhold their identity. Acts of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] have been performed anonymously when benefactors do not wish to be acknowledged. A person who feels threatened might attempt to mitigate that threat through anonymity. A witness to a crime might seek to avoid retribution, for example, by anonymously calling a crime tipline. Criminals might proceed anonymously to conceal their participation in a crime. Anonymity may also be created unintentionally, through the loss of identifying information due to the passage of time or a destructive event.\n\nIn a certain situations, however, it may be illegal to remain anonymous. In the [[United States]], 24 [[U.S. state|states]] have [[Stop and identify statutes|\"stop and identify\" statutes]] that require persons detained to self-identify when requested by a law enforcement officer.\n\nThe term \"anonymous message\" typically refers to a message that does not reveal its sender. In many countries, anonymous letters are protected by law and must be delivered as regular letters.\n\nIn [[mathematics]], in reference to an arbitrary element (e.g., a human, an object, a [[computer]]), within a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (called the \"anonymity set\"), \"anonymity\" of that element refers to the property of that element of not being identifiable within this set. If it is not identifiable, then the element is said to be \"anonymous.\"\n\n==Pseudonymity==\nSometimes a person may desire a long-term relationship (such as a reputation) with another party without necessarily disclosing [[personally identifying information]] to that party. In this case, it may be useful for the person to establish a unique identifier, called a [[pseudonym]]. Examples of pseudonyms are [[pen name]]s, [[nickname]]s, [[credit card number]]s, student numbers, [[bank account]] numbers, etc. A pseudonym enables the other party to link different messages from the same person and, thereby, to establish a long-term relationship. Pseudonyms are widely used in [[social network]]s and other virtual communication, although recently some important service providers like Google try to discourage pseudonymity.<ref>[[Nymwars]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}\nSomeone using a pseudonym would be strictly considered to be using \"pseudonymity\" not \"anonymity\", but sometimes the latter is used to refer to both (in general, a situation where the legal identity of the person is disguised)\n\n==Psychological effects==\nAnonymity may reduce the accountability one perceives to have for their actions, and removes the impact these actions might otherwise have on their reputation. This can have dramatic effects, both useful and harmful to various parties involved. Thus, it may be used for psychological tactics involving any respective party to purport or support or discredit any sort of activity or belief.\n\nIn conversational settings, anonymity may allow people to reveal personal history and feelings without fear of later embarrassment. Electronic conversational media can provide physical isolation, in addition to anonymity.  This prevents physical retaliation for remarks, and prevents negative or [[taboo]] behavior or discussion from tarnishing the reputation of the speaker. This can be beneficial when discussing very private matters, or taboo subjects or expressing views or revealing facts that may put someone in physical, financial, or legal danger (such as [[law|illegal]] activity, or unpopular, or outlawed political views).\n\nIn work settings, the three most common forms of anonymous communication are traditional suggestion boxes, written feedback, and [[Caller ID]] blocking. Additionally, the appropriateness of anonymous organizational communication varies depending on the use, with organizational surveys or assessments typically perceived as highly appropriate and firing perceived as highly inappropriate. Anonymity use and appropriateness have also been found to be significantly related to the quality of relationships with key others at work.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Craig R.|title=Anonymous Communication in Organizations: Assessing Use and Appropriateness|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|year=2005|volume=19|issue=2|page=157|doi=10.1177/0893318905279191|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n[[File:Anonymous Scientology 1 by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|Protesters outside a [[Scientology]] center on February 10, 2008, donning masks, scarves, hoods, and sunglasses to obscure their faces, and gloves and long sleeves to protect them from leaving [[fingerprint]]s.]]\n\nWith few perceived negative consequences, anonymous or semi-anonymous forums often provide a soapbox for disruptive conversational behavior. The term \"[[Internet troll|troll]]\" is sometimes used to refer to those who engage in such disruptive behavior.\n\nRelative anonymity is often enjoyed in large crowds. Different people have different psychological and philosophical reactions to this development, especially as a modern phenomenon. This anonymity is an important factor in [[crowd psychology]], and behavior in situations such as a [[riot]]. This perceived anonymity can be compromised by technologies such as [[photography]].

Some consumers prefer to use cash when buying everyday goods (like groceries or tools), to prevent sellers from aggregating information or soliciting them in the future. Credit cards are linked to a person's name, and can be used to discover other information, such as postal address, phone number, etc. The [[ecash]] system was developed to allow secure anonymous transactions. Another example would be Enymity, which actually makes a purchase on a customer's behalf. When purchasing taboo goods and services, anonymity makes many potential consumers more comfortable with or more willing to engage in the transaction. Many [[loyalty program]]s use cards that personally identify the consumer engaging in each transaction (possibly for later solicitation, or for redemption or security purposes), or that act as a numerical [[pseudonym]], for use in [[data mining]].\n\nAnonymity can also be used as a protection against legal prosecution. For example, when committing unlawful actions, many criminals attempt to avoid identification by the means of obscuring/covering their faces with [[scarves]] or [[mask]]s, and wear [[gloves]] or other hand coverings in order to not leave any [[fingerprint]]s. In [[organized crime]], groups of criminals may collaborate on a certain project without revealing to each other their names or other personally identifiable information. The movie ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' depicted a fictional collaboration by people who had never previously met and did not know who had recruited them. The anonymous purchase of a gun or knife to be used in a crime helps prevent linking an abandoned weapon to the identity of the perpetrator.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Anonymity in charity==\nThere are two aspects, one, giving to a large charitable organization obscures the beneficiary of a donation from the benefactor, the other is giving anonymously to obscure the benefactor both from the beneficiary and from everyone else. There are many reasons this is done.\n\nAnonymous charity has long been a widespread and durable moral precept of many ethical and religious systems, as well as being in practice a widespread human activity. A benefactor may not wish to establish any relationship with the beneficiary, particularly if the beneficiary is perceived as being unsavory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caner|first=Daniel F.|title=Clemency, A Neglected Aspect of Early Christian Philanthropy|date=2018-06-26|journal=Religions|volume=9|issue=8|page=229|doi=10.3390/rel9080229|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=specifically for the \"unsavory\" claim}} Benefactors may not wish to identify themselves as capable of giving.

In the United States, disclosure of identity is required to be able to [[vote]], though the [[secret ballot]] prevents disclosure of individual voting patterns.  In [[airport]]s in most countries, passengers are not allowed to board flights unless they have identified themselves to airline or transportation security personnel, typically in the form of the presentation of an [[identification card]].\n\nOn the other hand, some policies and procedures require anonymity.\n\n==Referring to the anonymous==\nWhen it is necessary to refer to someone who is anonymous, it is typically necessary to create a type of pseudo-identification for that person. In literature, the most common way to state that the identity of an author is unknown is to refer to them as simply \"Anonymous\". This is usually the case with older texts in which the author is long dead and unable to claim authorship of a work. When the work claims to be that of some famous author the [[pseudonym]]ous author is identified as \"Pseudo-\", as in [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], an author claiming&mdash;and long believed&mdash;to be [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], an early Christian convert.\n\n''Anonymus'', in its [[Latin]] spelling, generally with a specific city designation, is traditionally used by scholars in the humanities to refer to an ancient writer whose name is not known, or to a manuscript of their work. Many such writers have left valuable historical or literary records: an incomplete list of such ''Anonymi'' is at [[Anonymus (disambiguation)|Anonymus]].\n\nIn the [[history of art]], many painting workshops can be identified by their characteristic style and discussed and the workshop's output set in chronological order.  Sometimes archival research later identifies the name, as when the \"Master of Fl\u00e9malle\"&mdash;defined by three paintings in the St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut in [[Frankfurt]]&mdash; was identified as [[Robert Campin]]. The 20th-century art historian [[Bernard Berenson]] methodically identified numerous early Renaissance Florentine and Sienese workshops under such [[sobriquet]]s as \"Amico di Sandro\" for an anonymous painter in the immediate circle of [[Sandro Botticelli]].\n\nIn legal cases, a popularly accepted name to use when it is determined that an individual needs to maintain anonymity is \"[[John Doe]]\". This name is often modified to \"Jane Doe\" when the anonymity-seeker is female. The same names are also commonly used when the identification of a dead person is not known. The semi-acronym Unsub is used as law enforcement slang for \"Unknown Subject of an Investigation\".\n\nThe [[military]] often feels a need to honor the remains of soldiers for whom identification is impossible. In many countries, such a memorial is named the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]].\n\n==Anonymity and the press==\nMost modern newspapers and magazines attribute their articles to individual editors, or to [[News agency|news agencies]]. An exception is the Markker weekly ''[[The Economist]].'' All [[British newspapers]] run their leaders, or [[editorials]], anonymously. ''The Economist'' fully adopts this policy, saying \"Many hands write ''The Economist'', but it speaks with a collective voice\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/help/about-us|title=About us|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=March 25, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324021901/https://www.economist.com/help/about-us|archivedate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> Guardian considers that ''\"people will often speak more honestly if they are allowed to speak anonymously\"''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/08/EditorialGuidelinesAug2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714181756/http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/08/EditorialGuidelinesAug2011.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Eaman|first1=Ross|title=The A to Z of Journalism|publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2009|isbn=9780810870673|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e98aMyleL-cC&dq=British+newspapers++anonymously|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208170155/https://books.google.bg/books?id=e98aMyleL-cC&dq=British+newspapers++anonymously&hl=bg&source=gbs_navlinks_s|archivedate=2015-02-08|date=2009-10-12}}</ref> According to Ross Eaman, in his book ''The A to Z of Journalism'', until the mid-19th century, most writers in Great Britain, especially the less well known, did not sign their names to their work in newspapers, magazines and reviews.<ref>Anonymous Online Comments:The Law and Best Media Practices from Around the World, by Kyle A.

This address can be mapped to a particular [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP), and this ISP can then provide information about what customer that IP address was leased to. This does not necessarily implicate a specific individual (because other people could be using that customer's connection, especially if the customer is a public resource, such as a library), but it provides regional information and serves as powerful circumstantial evidence.\n\nAnonymizing services such as [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] address the issue of IP tracking. In short, they work by encrypting packets within multiple layers of encryption. The packet follows a predetermined route through the anonymizing network. Each router sees the immediate previous router as the origin and the immediate next router as the destination. Thus, no router ever knows both the true origin and destination of the packet. This makes these services more secure than centralized anonymizing services (where a central point of knowledge exists).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ohm|first=Paul|title=Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization|journal=UCLA Law Review|date=13 August 2009|volume=57|pages=1701, 2010|ssrn=1450006|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nSites such as [[Chatroulette]], [[Omegle]], and [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] (which pair up random users for a conversation) capitalized on a fascination with anonymity.

And anonymity can in many cases be desirable for one person and not desirable for another person. A company may, for example, not like an employee to divulge information about improper practices within the company, but society as a whole may find it important that such improper practices are publicly exposed. \nGood purposes of anonymity and pseudonymity:\n\n* People dependent on an organization, or afraid of revenge, may divulge serious misuse, which should be revealed. Anonymous tips can be used as an information source by newspapers, as well as by police departments, soliciting tips aimed at catching criminals.

It creates an international regime for imposing civil and criminal penalties on Internet counterfeiting and copyright infringement. Although ACTA is intentionally vague, leaving signatories to draw precise rules themselves, critics say it could mean innocent travellers having their laptops searched for unlicensed music, or being jailed for carrying a generic drug. Infringers could be liable for the total loss of potential sales (implying that everyone who buys a counterfeit product would have bought the real thing). It applies to unintentional use of copyright material. It puts the onus on website owners to ensure they comply with laws across several territories. It has been negotiated secretively and outside established international trade bodies, despite EU criticisms.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21547235|title=ACTA up|journal=The Economist|accessdate=13 June 2016|via=The Economist|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809124805/http://www.economist.com/node/21547235|archivedate=9 August 2016|date=2012-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Anonymity and politics==\n[[File:Pasquino 02.jpg|thumb|Modern pasquinades glued to the base of [[Pasquino]], one of the [[Talking Statues of Rome]]]]\nThe history of anonymous expression in political dissent is both long and with important effect, as in the [[Letters of Junius]] or [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'', or scurrilous as in [[pasquinade]]s.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]], however, was not anonymous.  If it had been unsigned, it might well have been less effective.

Some, such as [[Thomas Pynchon]], and [[J.&nbsp;D. Salinger]] who seem to want to avoid the \"limelight\" of popularity, simply want to live private lives. This would appear to be the case with [[De Onbekende Beeldhouwer]] (Anonymous Sculptor), whose exhibited work in [[Amsterdam]] attracted strong attention in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Depictions, text in Dutch [http://www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl/Amsterdam_C/borst.htm Retrieved 23 June 2017.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101115146/http://www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl/Amsterdam_C/borst.htm |date=1 November 2010 }}</ref> Some others include avant-garde ensemble [[The Residents]], costumed comedy rock band [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]], and until 2004, musician [[Jandek]].\n\nThis is frequently applied in fiction, from [[The Lone Ranger]], [[Superman]], and [[Batman]], where a hidden identity is assumed.\n\n==Mathematics of anonymity==\nSuppose that only [[Alice and Bob|Alice, Bob, and Carol]] have keys to a bank safe and that, one day, contents of the safe go missing (lock not violated). Without additional information, we cannot know for sure whether it was Alice, Bob or Carol who emptied the safe. Notably, each element in {Alice, Bob, Carol} could be the perpetrator with a probability of 1. However, as long as none of them was convicted with 100% certainty, we must hold that the perpetrator remains anonymous and that the attribution of the probability of 1 to one of the players has to remain undecided.\n\nIf Carol has a definite alibi at the time of perpetration, then we may deduce that it must have been either Alice or Bob who emptied the safe. In this particular case, the perpetrator is not completely anonymous anymore, as both Alice and Bob now know \"who did it\" with a probability of 1.\n\n==See also==\n{{too many see alsos|date=April 2016}}\n* Anonymity\n** [[Anonymity application]]\n** [[Anonymous blogging]]\n** [[Anonymous P2P]]\n** [[Anonymous remailer]]\n** [[Anonymous web browsing]]\n** [[Anonymous work]]\n** [[Bank secrecy|Financial secrecy]]\n** [[List of anonymously published works]]\n** [[List of anonymous masters]]\n** [[Notname]]\n* [[Anonymous (group)]]\n* [[Data privacy]]\n* [[Data anonymization]]\n* [[Friend-to-friend]]\n* [[Identity theft]]\n* [[Internet privacy]]\n* [[John Doe]]\n* [[Online disinhibition effect]]\n** [[Penny Arcade#\"Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory\"|\"Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory\"]]\n* [[Personally identifiable information]]\n* [[Politics]]\n** [[Crypto-anarchism]]\n* [[Privacy software]] and [[Privacy-enhancing technologies]]\n** [[FLAIM]]\n** [[I2P]]\n** [[I2P#I2P-Bote|I2P-Bote]]\n** [[Java Anon Proxy]]\n** [[Onion routing]]\n*** [[Tor (anonymity network)]]\n** [[Private P2P]]\n* [[Pseudonymity]], [[Pseudonymization]]\n* [[Top-coded]] data (in statistics)\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Personal names}}\n{{Media culture}}\n{{Privacy}}\n\n[[Category:Anonymity| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|identification|other uses|Anonymous (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Situation in which a person is non-identifiable, unreachable, or untrackable}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n'''Anonymity'''{{efn|[[Adjective]]: \"anonymous\".

Some writers have argued that namelessness, though technically correct, does not capture what is more centrally at stake in contexts of anonymity. The important idea here is that a person be non-identifiable, unreachable, or untrackable.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = Kathleen A | year = 1999 | title = Anonymity | url = | journal = Ethics and Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 23\u201335 | doi = 10.1023/A:1010066509278 }}; {{cite journal | last1 = Nissenbaum | first1 = Helen | year = 1999 | title = The Meaning of Anonymity in an Information Age | url = | journal = The Information Society | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 141\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/019722499128592 }}; {{cite journal | last1 = Matthews | first1 = Steve | year = 2010 | title = Anonymity and the Social Self | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 351\u201363 }}</ref> Anonymity is seen as a technique, or a way of realizing, a certain other values, such as [[privacy]], or liberty.\n\nAn important example for anonymity being not only protected, but enforced by law is the vote in [[Secret ballot|free elections]]. In many other situations (like conversation between strangers, buying some product or service in a shop), anonymity is traditionally accepted as natural. There are also various situations in which a person might choose to withhold their identity. Acts of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] have been performed anonymously when benefactors do not wish to be acknowledged. A person who feels threatened might attempt to mitigate that threat through anonymity. A witness to a crime might seek to avoid retribution, for example, by anonymously calling a crime tipline. Criminals might proceed anonymously to conceal their participation in a crime. Anonymity may also be created unintentionally, through the loss of identifying information due to the passage of time or a destructive event.\n\nIn a certain situations, however, it may be illegal to remain anonymous. In the [[United States]], 24 [[U.S. state|states]] have [[Stop and identify statutes|\"stop and identify\" statutes]] that require persons detained to self-identify when requested by a law enforcement officer.\n\nThe term \"anonymous message\" typically refers to a message that does not reveal its sender. In many countries, anonymous letters are protected by law and must be delivered as regular letters.\n\nIn [[mathematics]], in reference to an arbitrary element (e.g., a human, an object, a [[computer]]), within a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (called the \"anonymity set\"), \"anonymity\" of that element refers to the property of that element of not being identifiable within this set. If it is not identifiable, then the element is said to be \"anonymous.\"\n\n==Pseudonymity==\nSometimes a person may desire a long-term relationship (such as a reputation) with another party without necessarily disclosing [[personally identifying information]] to that party. In this case, it may be useful for the person to establish a unique identifier, called a [[pseudonym]]. Examples of pseudonyms are [[pen name]]s, [[nickname]]s, [[credit card number]]s, student numbers, [[bank account]] numbers, etc. A pseudonym enables the other party to link different messages from the same person and, thereby, to establish a long-term relationship. Pseudonyms are widely used in [[social network]]s and other virtual communication, although recently some important service providers like Google try to discourage pseudonymity.<ref>[[Nymwars]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}}\nSomeone using a pseudonym would be strictly considered to be using \"pseudonymity\" not \"anonymity\", but sometimes the latter is used to refer to both (in general, a situation where the legal identity of the person is disguised)\n\n==Psychological effects==\nAnonymity may reduce the accountability one perceives to have for their actions, and removes the impact these actions might otherwise have on their reputation. This can have dramatic effects, both useful and harmful to various parties involved. Thus, it may be used for psychological tactics involving any respective party to purport or support or discredit any sort of activity or belief.\n\nIn conversational settings, anonymity may allow people to reveal personal history and feelings without fear of later embarrassment. Electronic conversational media can provide physical isolation, in addition to anonymity.  This prevents physical retaliation for remarks, and prevents negative or [[taboo]] behavior or discussion from tarnishing the reputation of the speaker. This can be beneficial when discussing very private matters, or taboo subjects or expressing views or revealing facts that may put someone in physical, financial, or legal danger (such as [[law|illegal]] activity, or unpopular, or outlawed political views).\n\nIn work settings, the three most common forms of anonymous communication are traditional suggestion boxes, written feedback, and [[Caller ID]] blocking. Additionally, the appropriateness of anonymous organizational communication varies depending on the use, with organizational surveys or assessments typically perceived as highly appropriate and firing perceived as highly inappropriate. Anonymity use and appropriateness have also been found to be significantly related to the quality of relationships with key others at work.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Craig R.|title=Anonymous Communication in Organizations: Assessing Use and Appropriateness|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|year=2005|volume=19|issue=2|page=157|doi=10.1177/0893318905279191|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n[[File:Anonymous Scientology 1 by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|Protesters outside a [[Scientology]] center on February 10, 2008, donning masks, scarves, hoods, and sunglasses to obscure their faces, and gloves and long sleeves to protect them from leaving [[fingerprint]]s.]]\n\nWith few perceived negative consequences, anonymous or semi-anonymous forums often provide a soapbox for disruptive conversational behavior. The term \"[[Internet troll|troll]]\" is sometimes used to refer to those who engage in such disruptive behavior.\n\nRelative anonymity is often enjoyed in large crowds. Different people have different psychological and philosophical reactions to this development, especially as a modern phenomenon. This anonymity is an important factor in [[crowd psychology]], and behavior in situations such as a [[riot]]. This perceived anonymity can be compromised by technologies such as [[photography]]. [[Groupthink]] behavior and [[conformity]] are also considered to be an established effect of internet anonymity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tsikerdekis|first1=Michail|title=The effects of perceived anonymity and anonymity states on conformity and groupthink in online communities: A Wikipedia study|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|date=8 March 2013|volume=64|issue=5|pages=1001\u20131015|doi=10.1002/asi.22795}}</ref>\n\nAnonymity also permits highly trained professionals such as [[judge]]s to freely express themselves regarding the strategies they employ to perform their jobs objectively.<ref name=\"Australian Judges \">{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/judges-admit-to-emotion-in-court-but-say-they-avoid-bias/7885508 | title=Print Email Facebook Twitter More Judges admit to emotion in court but say they avoid bias in judgments | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=2016-09-28 | accessdate=2016-09-28 | author=Carbonell, Rachel | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929142903/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/judges-admit-to-emotion-in-court-but-say-they-avoid-bias/7885508 | archivedate=2016-09-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Anonymity, commerce, and crime==\nAnonymous commercial transactions can protect the privacy of consumers. Some consumers prefer to use cash when buying everyday goods (like groceries or tools), to prevent sellers from aggregating information or soliciting them in the future. Credit cards are linked to a person's name, and can be used to discover other information, such as postal address, phone number, etc. The [[ecash]] system was developed to allow secure anonymous transactions. Another example would be Enymity, which actually makes a purchase on a customer's behalf. When purchasing taboo goods and services, anonymity makes many potential consumers more comfortable with or more willing to engage in the transaction. Many [[loyalty program]]s use cards that personally identify the consumer engaging in each transaction (possibly for later solicitation, or for redemption or security purposes), or that act as a numerical [[pseudonym]], for use in [[data mining]].\n\nAnonymity can also be used as a protection against legal prosecution. For example, when committing unlawful actions, many criminals attempt to avoid identification by the means of obscuring/covering their faces with [[scarves]] or [[mask]]s, and wear [[gloves]] or other hand coverings in order to not leave any [[fingerprint]]s. In [[organized crime]], groups of criminals may collaborate on a certain project without revealing to each other their names or other personally identifiable information. The movie ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' depicted a fictional collaboration by people who had never previously met and did not know who had recruited them. The anonymous purchase of a gun or knife to be used in a crime helps prevent linking an abandoned weapon to the identity of the perpetrator.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Anonymity in charity==\nThere are two aspects, one, giving to a large charitable organization obscures the beneficiary of a donation from the benefactor, the other is giving anonymously to obscure the benefactor both from the beneficiary and from everyone else. There are many reasons this is done.\n\nAnonymous charity has long been a widespread and durable moral precept of many ethical and religious systems, as well as being in practice a widespread human activity. A benefactor may not wish to establish any relationship with the beneficiary, particularly if the beneficiary is perceived as being unsavory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caner|first=Daniel F.|title=Clemency, A Neglected Aspect of Early Christian Philanthropy|date=2018-06-26|journal=Religions|volume=9|issue=8|page=229|doi=10.3390/rel9080229|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=specifically for the \"unsavory\" claim}} Benefactors may not wish to identify themselves as capable of giving.

In the United States, disclosure of identity is required to be able to [[vote]], though the [[secret ballot]] prevents disclosure of individual voting patterns.  In [[airport]]s in most countries, passengers are not allowed to board flights unless they have identified themselves to airline or transportation security personnel, typically in the form of the presentation of an [[identification card]].\n\nOn the other hand, some policies and procedures require anonymity.\n\n==Referring to the anonymous==\nWhen it is necessary to refer to someone who is anonymous, it is typically necessary to create a type of pseudo-identification for that person. In literature, the most common way to state that the identity of an author is unknown is to refer to them as simply \"Anonymous\". This is usually the case with older texts in which the author is long dead and unable to claim authorship of a work. When the work claims to be that of some famous author the [[pseudonym]]ous author is identified as \"Pseudo-\", as in [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], an author claiming&mdash;and long believed&mdash;to be [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], an early Christian convert.\n\n''Anonymus'', in its [[Latin]] spelling, generally with a specific city designation, is traditionally used by scholars in the humanities to refer to an ancient writer whose name is not known, or to a manuscript of their work. Many such writers have left valuable historical or literary records: an incomplete list of such ''Anonymi'' is at [[Anonymus (disambiguation)|Anonymus]].\n\nIn the [[history of art]], many painting workshops can be identified by their characteristic style and discussed and the workshop's output set in chronological order.  Sometimes archival research later identifies the name, as when the \"Master of Fl\u00e9malle\"&mdash;defined by three paintings in the St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut in [[Frankfurt]]&mdash; was identified as [[Robert Campin]]. The 20th-century art historian [[Bernard Berenson]] methodically identified numerous early Renaissance Florentine and Sienese workshops under such [[sobriquet]]s as \"Amico di Sandro\" for an anonymous painter in the immediate circle of [[Sandro Botticelli]].\n\nIn legal cases, a popularly accepted name to use when it is determined that an individual needs to maintain anonymity is \"[[John Doe]]\". This name is often modified to \"Jane Doe\" when the anonymity-seeker is female. The same names are also commonly used when the identification of a dead person is not known. The semi-acronym Unsub is used as law enforcement slang for \"Unknown Subject of an Investigation\".\n\nThe [[military]] often feels a need to honor the remains of soldiers for whom identification is impossible. In many countries, such a memorial is named the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]].\n\n==Anonymity and the press==\nMost modern newspapers and magazines attribute their articles to individual editors, or to [[News agency|news agencies]]. An exception is the Markker weekly ''[[The Economist]].'' All [[British newspapers]] run their leaders, or [[editorials]], anonymously. ''The Economist'' fully adopts this policy, saying \"Many hands write ''The Economist'', but it speaks with a collective voice\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/help/about-us|title=About us|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=March 25, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324021901/https://www.economist.com/help/about-us|archivedate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> Guardian considers that ''\"people will often speak more honestly if they are allowed to speak anonymously\"''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/08/EditorialGuidelinesAug2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714181756/http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/08/EditorialGuidelinesAug2011.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Eaman|first1=Ross|title=The A to Z of Journalism|publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2009|isbn=9780810870673|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e98aMyleL-cC&dq=British+newspapers++anonymously|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208170155/https://books.google.bg/books?id=e98aMyleL-cC&dq=British+newspapers++anonymously&hl=bg&source=gbs_navlinks_s|archivedate=2015-02-08|date=2009-10-12}}</ref> According to Ross Eaman, in his book ''The A to Z of Journalism'', until the mid-19th century, most writers in Great Britain, especially the less well known, did not sign their names to their work in newspapers, magazines and reviews.<ref>Anonymous Online Comments:The Law and Best Media Practices from Around the World, by Kyle A.

According to the University of Stockholm this is creating more freedom of expression, and less accountability.<ref>Jacob Palme and Mikael Berglund, [http://people.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/society/anonymity.html \"Anonymity on the Internet\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221051847/http://people.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/society/anonymity.html |date=2008-02-21 }}, Jacob Palme's Home Page</ref> [[Wikipedia]] is collaboratively written mostly by authors using either unidentifiable pseudonyms or [[IP address]] identifiers, although a few have used identified pseudonyms or their real names.\n\nHowever, the Internet was not designed for anonymity: [[IP addresses]] serve as virtual mailing addresses, which means that any time any resource on the Internet is accessed, it is accessed from a particular IP address, and the data traffic patterns to and from IP addresses can be intercepted, monitored, and analysed, even if the content of that traffic is encrypted. This address can be mapped to a particular [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP), and this ISP can then provide information about what customer that IP address was leased to. This does not necessarily implicate a specific individual (because other people could be using that customer's connection, especially if the customer is a public resource, such as a library), but it provides regional information and serves as powerful circumstantial evidence.\n\nAnonymizing services such as [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] address the issue of IP tracking. In short, they work by encrypting packets within multiple layers of encryption. The packet follows a predetermined route through the anonymizing network. Each router sees the immediate previous router as the origin and the immediate next router as the destination. Thus, no router ever knows both the true origin and destination of the packet. This makes these services more secure than centralized anonymizing services (where a central point of knowledge exists).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ohm|first=Paul|title=Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization|journal=UCLA Law Review|date=13 August 2009|volume=57|pages=1701, 2010|ssrn=1450006|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nSites such as [[Chatroulette]], [[Omegle]], and [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] (which pair up random users for a conversation) capitalized on a fascination with anonymity.

And anonymity can in many cases be desirable for one person and not desirable for another person. A company may, for example, not like an employee to divulge information about improper practices within the company, but society as a whole may find it important that such improper practices are publicly exposed. \nGood purposes of anonymity and pseudonymity:\n\n* People dependent on an organization, or afraid of revenge, may divulge serious misuse, which should be revealed. Anonymous tips can be used as an information source by newspapers, as well as by police departments, soliciting tips aimed at catching criminals. Not everyone will regard such anonymous communication as good. For example, message boards established outside companies, but for employees of such companies to vent their opinions on their employer, have sometimes been used in ways that at least the companies themselves were not happy about [Abelson 2001].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/technology/29HARA.html?searchpv=site14 By the Water Cooler in Cyberspace, the Talk Turns Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704182846/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/technology/29HARA.html?searchpv=site14 |date=2016-07-04 }}, by Reed Abelson, New York Times, 29 April 2001</ref> Police use of anonymity is a complex issue, since the police often will want to know the identity of the tipper in order to get more information, evaluate the reliability or get the tipper as a witness. Is it ethical for police to identify the tipper if it has opened up an anonymous tipping hotline?\n* People in a country with a repressive political regime may use anonymity (for example Internet-based anonymity servers in other countries) to avoid persecution for their political opinions. Note that even in democratic countries, some people claim, rightly or wrongly, that certain political opinions are persecuted.

For example, some people use anonymity in order to say harmful things about other people, known as [[cyberbullying]]. \n*[[Internet troll]]s use anonymity to harm discussions in online social platforms.\n\nThe border between illegal and legal but offensive use is not very sharp, and varies depending on the law in each country.<ref>[http://people.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/society/anonymity.html#fn1 Anonymity on the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221051847/http://people.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/society/anonymity.html |date=2008-02-21 }}, by Jacob Palme, using much material from the paper \"Usenet news and anon.penet.fi\" by Mikael Berglund</ref>\n\n=== Anonymous (group) ===\n[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] (used as a mass noun) is a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist entities.

[[John Perry Barlow]], [[Joichi Ito]], and other U.S. [[blog]]gers express a very strong support for anonymous editing as one of the basic requirements of [[open politics]] as conducted on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.globalvoicesonline.org/wiki/index.php/Recommendations |title=The Infrastructure of Democracy |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2012-11-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511202136/http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/wiki/index.php/Recommendations |archivedate=May 11, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Anonymity and pseudonymity in art==\nAnonymity is directly related to the concept of [[obscurantism]] or [[pseudonymity]], where an artist or a group attempts to remain anonymous, for various reasons, not limited to: adding an element of mystique to themselves or their work, attempting to avoid what is known as the \"[[cult of personality]]\" or [[Apotheosis|hero worship]], where the [[charisma]], good looks, wealth or other unrelated or mildly related aspects of the person(s) is the main reason for interest in their work, rather than the work itself; also the ability to break into a field or area of interest normally dominated by males, such as [[James Tiptree, Jr]], the famous [[science fiction]] author who was actually a woman named Alice Bradley Sheldon, as seems to also be the case with [[JT LeRoy]].\n\nThe reasons for choosing this approach vary. Some, such as [[Thomas Pynchon]], and [[J.&nbsp;D. Salinger]] who seem to want to avoid the \"limelight\" of popularity, simply want to live private lives. This would appear to be the case with [[De Onbekende Beeldhouwer]] (Anonymous Sculptor), whose exhibited work in [[Amsterdam]] attracted strong attention in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Depictions, text in Dutch [http://www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl/Amsterdam_C/borst.htm Retrieved 23 June 2017.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101115146/http://www.buitenbeeldinbeeld.nl/Amsterdam_C/borst.htm |date=1 November 2010 }}</ref> Some others include avant-garde ensemble [[The Residents]], costumed comedy rock band [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]], and until 2004, musician [[Jandek]].\n\nThis is frequently applied in fiction, from [[The Lone Ranger]], [[Superman]], and [[Batman]], where a hidden identity is assumed.\n\n==Mathematics of anonymity==\nSuppose that only [[Alice and Bob|Alice, Bob, and Carol]] have keys to a bank safe and that, one day, contents of the safe go missing (lock not violated). Without additional information, we cannot know for sure whether it was Alice, Bob or Carol who emptied the safe. Notably, each element in {Alice, Bob, Carol} could be the perpetrator with a probability of 1. However, as long as none of them was convicted with 100% certainty, we must hold that the perpetrator remains anonymous and that the attribution of the probability of 1 to one of the players has to remain undecided.\n\nIf Carol has a definite alibi at the time of perpetration, then we may deduce that it must have been either Alice or Bob who emptied the safe. In this particular case, the perpetrator is not completely anonymous anymore, as both Alice and Bob now know \"who did it\" with a probability of 1.\n\n==See also==\n{{too many see alsos|date=April 2016}}\n* Anonymity\n** [[Anonymity application]]\n** [[Anonymous blogging]]\n** [[Anonymous P2P]]\n** [[Anonymous remailer]]\n** [[Anonymous web browsing]]\n** [[Anonymous work]]\n** [[Bank secrecy|Financial secrecy]]\n** [[List of anonymously published works]]\n** [[List of anonymous masters]]\n** [[Notname]]\n* [[Anonymous (group)]]\n* [[Data privacy]]\n* [[Data anonymization]]\n* [[Friend-to-friend]]\n* [[Identity theft]]\n* [[Internet privacy]]\n* [[John Doe]]\n* [[Online disinhibition effect]]\n** [[Penny Arcade#\"Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory\"|\"Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory\"]]\n* [[Personally identifiable information]]\n* [[Politics]]\n** [[Crypto-anarchism]]\n* [[Privacy software]] and [[Privacy-enhancing technologies]]\n** [[FLAIM]]\n** [[I2P]]\n** [[I2P#I2P-Bote|I2P-Bote]]\n** [[Java Anon Proxy]]\n** [[Onion routing]]\n*** [[Tor (anonymity network)]]\n** [[Private P2P]]\n* [[Pseudonymity]], [[Pseudonymization]]\n* [[Top-coded]] data (in statistics)\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Personal names}}\n{{Media culture}}\n{{Privacy}}\n\n[[Category:Anonymity| ]]\n", "name_user": "170.10.13.63", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePseudonymity)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"}

Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library, including ones by [[Leonhard Euler]], and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. One of the pioneers of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity theory]], she won the grand prize from the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] for her essay on the subject. Her work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life.{{sfn|Case|Leggett|2005|p=39}} Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred.<ref>Mackinnon, Nick (1990). \"Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?\". The Mathematical Gazette 74 (470): 346\u2013351, esp. p. 347.</ref> On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\u2019 school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the [[Sophie Germain Prize]] in her honor.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Family===\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France, in a house on Rue Saint-Denis. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois, was a wealthy silk merchant,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}}{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} though some believe he was a [[goldsmith]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the [[bourgeoisie]] to the [[Estates General of 1789|\u00c9tats-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux]], which he saw change into the [[French Revolution#National Assembly (1789)|Constitutional Assembly]]. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}}\n\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, named Ang\u00e9lique-Ambroise, and one older sister, named Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain's nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline's son, published some of Germain's work after she died (see [[Sophie Germain#Work in philosophy|Work in Philosophy]]).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\n===Introduction to mathematics===\nWhen Germain was 13, the [[French Revolution#Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment she turned to her father's library. Here she found [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla|J. E. Montucla's]] ''L'Histoire des Math\u00e9matiques'', and his story of the death of [[Archimedes]] intrigued her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\nSophie Germain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}} could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=90}} So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. She also enjoyed {{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 d'Arithm\u00e9tique}} by [[\u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout]] and {{lang|fr|Le Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel}} by [[:fr:Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin|Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin]]. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\nGermain's parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics.{{sfn|Gray|1978|pp=47\u201348}} After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\n===\u00c9cole Polytechnique===\n[[Image:Porton antigua sede \u00c9cole Polytechnique Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the historic building of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique]]\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] opened.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=69}} Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/sophie-germain.html |first=Simon |last=Singh |year=1997 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |title=Math's Hidden Woman |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} and he became her mentor.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}}\n\n==Early work in number theory==\n\n===Correspondence with Legendre===\nGermain first became interested in [[number theory]] in 1798 when [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] published {{lang|fr|Essai sur la th\u00e9orie des nombres}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. Legendre showed some of Germain's work in the {{lang|fr|Suppl\u00e9ment}} to his second edition of the {{lang|fr|Th\u00e9orie des Nombres}}, where he calls it {{lang|fr|tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse}} (\"very ingenious\"). See also [[#Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem|Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem]] below.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}}\n\n===Correspondence with Gauss===\n[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\nGermain's interest in number theory was renewed when she read [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' monumental work {{lang|la|[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems,{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=352}} she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} to the author himself, who was one year younger than her.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=157}} The first letter, dated 21 November 1804,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} discussed Gauss' {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}} and presented some of Germain's work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]] of the form ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;7.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}} However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}}\n\nAround 1807 (sources differ),{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of [[Braunschweig]], where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety, a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}\n\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  He replied:{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=349}}\n<blockquote>\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory's] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the most noble courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\n</blockquote>\n\nGauss' letters to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Olbers]] show that his praise for Germain was sincere.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}{{sfn|Bell|1937|p=262}} In the same 1807 letter, Sophie claimed that if <math>x^n + y^n</math> is of the form <math>h^2 + nf^2</math>, then <math>x + y</math> is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: <math>15^{11} + 8^{11}</math> can be written as <math>h^2 + 11 f^2</math>, but <math>15 + 8</math> cannot.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|1994}}\n\nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\n==Work in elasticity==\n\n===Germain's first attempt for the Academy Prize===\n[[Image:Echladni.jpg|thumb|left|Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni]]\nWhen Germain's correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning [[Ernst Chladni]]'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the Academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange's comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] deterred all but two contestants, [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Denis Poisson]] and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the Academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant,{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}} She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Lagrange was able to use Germain's work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n===Subsequent attempts for the Prize===\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Germain's anonymous{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving [[multiple integral|double integrals]],{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain's help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the Academy commission, had had access to her work).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"{{lang|fr|Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques}}\",{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} under her own name, and on 8 January 1816{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Although Germain had at last been awarded the {{lang|fr|prix extraordinaire}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} the Academy was still not fully satisfied.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=91}} Sophie had derived the correct [[differential equation]] (a special case of the [[Kirchhoff\u2013Love_plate_theory#Isotropic_plates|Kirchhoff\u2013Love equation]]),{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} which led to incorrect boundary conditions.{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} Here is Germain's final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\n\n: <math>N^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial y^4}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial t^2} = 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''N''<sup>2</sup> is a constant.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Theory of Elasticity and of the Strength of Materials: Volume 1|author=Isaac Todhunter|editor=Karl Pearson|isbn=978-1108070423 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|page=153}}</ref><ref>This is equation (B) in Germain's own book. {{cite book|title=Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques|url=https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000|author=Sophie Germain|year=1821|page=[https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000/page/27 27]}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the Academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the Academy's tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with [[Joseph Fourier]], a secretary of the Academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}\n\n===Later work in elasticity===\n[[File:Germain - R\u00e9cherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques, 1821 - 723413.tif|thumb|{{lang|fr|R\u00e9cherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques}}, 1821]]\nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in her method.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the Academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the Academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 4}}\n\nOne further work of Germain's on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"{{lang|fr|M\u00e9moire sur la courbure des surfaces}}\". She used the [[mean curvature]] in her research (see [[Sophien|Honors in number theory]]).{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n==Later work in number theory==\n\n===Renewed interest===\nGermain's best work was in number theory,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}} and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the Academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} It reawakened Germain's interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}}\n\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|pp=356\u2013357}} Germain's letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=362}}\n\n===Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem===\n[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre de Fermat]]]]\nFermat's Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers ''p'' that do not divide any of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Case 2 includes all ''p'' that divide at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"[[Sophie Germain's theorem]]\":{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}}\n<blockquote>\nLet ''p'' be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''Np''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (''N'' is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\n# if ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;0 ([[modular arithmetic|mod ''P'']]), then ''P'' divides ''xyz'', and\n# ''p'' is not a ''p''-th power residue (mod ''P'').\nThen the first case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] holds true for ''p''.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all odd primes ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;197\".{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}} [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|L. E. Dickson]] later used Germain's theorem to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for odd primes less than 1700.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=763}}\n\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled {{lang|fr|Remarque sur l'impossibilit\u00e9 de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l'\u00e9quation x<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;y<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;z<sup>p</sup>}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}} Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat's theorem for ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\",{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}} around 40 digits long.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=371}}  Sophie did not publish this work. Her brilliant theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre's treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Legendre|Correspondence with Legendre]]).{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\",{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} but ultimately her method did not work.{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}\n\n==Work in philosophy==\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by [[Auguste Comte]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=73}}\n\nTwo of her philosophical works, {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es diverses}} and {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur l'\u00e9tat des sciences et des lettres, aux diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques de leur culture}}, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=53}}  {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es}} is a history of science and mathematics with Sophie's commentary.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations}}, the work admired by Comte, Sophie argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the [[humanities]].{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}}\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 5\u20136}} she continued to work. In 1831 ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' published her paper on the [[curvature]] of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} in <math>\\tfrac{4(x^p - 1)}{x - 1} = y^2 \\pm pz^2</math>\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Mary Gray records: \"She also published in {{lang|fr|Annales de chimie et de physique}} an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\"{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\nDespite Germain's intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"{{lang|fr|renti\u00e8re \u2013 annuitant}}\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} (property holder),{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} not a \"{{lang|fr|math\u00e9maticienne}}\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1837\u2014six years after Germain's death\u2014Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=347}}\n\n==Honors==\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:Grave, Sophie Germain.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Sophie Germain in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]\nGermain's resting place in the [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris is marked by a gravestone.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} <!-- The grave seems \"OK\" in the image, and the lower plaque includes a reference to the girls' school named after her, so I assume it has been kept up or replaced since the centennial mentioned next. --> At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died.

Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}} Germain was also included in [[H. J. Mozans]]' book \"[[Woman in Science]]\",{{sfn|Mozans|1913}} although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\".{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=201}} Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician [[Claude-Louis Navier]] as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nGermain's contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Gauss|Correspondence with Gauss]]).\n\n===Modern praise and criticisms===\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain's work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=51}} Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young [[child prodigy|prodigy]] to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384\u2013385}}\n\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain's theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain's work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} Mozans writes, however, that when the [[Eiffel tower]] was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain's name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower's construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}}, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\"{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} Gray adds that \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain's creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\",{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}} and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain's biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}\n\n==Germain in popular culture==\nGermain was referenced and quoted in [[David Auburn]]'s 2001 play ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]].'' The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden's [[Proof (2005 film)|film adaptation]] of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\n\nIn the fictional work \"[[The Last Theorem]]\" by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Frederik Pohl]], Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\nA new musical about Sophie Germain's life, entitled The Limit, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.\n\n==Sophie Germain Prize==\n\nThe [[Sophie Germain Prize]] ({{lang-fr|Prix Sophie Germain}}), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in Paris. Its purpose is to honour a French mathematician for research in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. This award, in the amount of \u20ac8,000, was established in 2003, under the auspices of the [[Institut de France]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Prix Sophie Germain \u2013 Fondation de l'Institut de France |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/prix/laureat_germain.pdf |publisher=Institut de France \u2013 Acad\u00e9mie des sciences |accessdate=20 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129202400/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/prix/laureat_germain.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014  }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for specific exponents]]\n*[[Sophie Germain Counter Mode]]\n*[[Sophie Germain prime]]\n*[[Sophie Germain Prize]]\n*[[Sophie Germain's theorem]]\n*[[Timeline of women in science]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooksby=yes|viaf=12440398}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bell |first=Eric Temple |authorlink=Eric Temple Bell |title=Men of Mathematics |year=1937 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |ref=harv|title-link=Men of Mathematics }} reprinted as {{cite book |last=Bell |first=Eric Temple |title=Men of Mathematics |year=1986 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-62818-6}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Case |first1=Bettye Anne|author1-link=Bettye Anne Case |first2=Anne M. |last2=Leggett|author2-link=Anne M.

Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library, including ones by [[Leonhard Euler]], and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]. One of the pioneers of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity theory]], she won the grand prize from the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] for her essay on the subject. Her work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life.{{sfn|Case|Leggett|2005|p=39}} Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred.<ref>Mackinnon, Nick (1990). \"Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?\". The Mathematical Gazette 74 (470): 346\u2013351, esp. p. 347.</ref> On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\u2019 school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the [[Sophie Germain Prize]] in her honor.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Family===\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France, in a house on Rue Saint-Denis. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois, was a wealthy silk merchant,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}}{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} though some believe he was a [[goldsmith]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the [[bourgeoisie]] to the [[Estates General of 1789|\u00c9tats-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux]], which he saw change into the [[French Revolution#National Assembly (1789)|Constitutional Assembly]]. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}}\n\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, named Ang\u00e9lique-Ambroise, and one older sister, named Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain's nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline's son, published some of Germain's work after she died (see [[Sophie Germain#Work in philosophy|Work in Philosophy]]).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\n===Introduction to mathematics===\nWhen Germain was 13, the [[French Revolution#Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment she turned to her father's library. Here she found [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla|J. E. Montucla's]] ''L'Histoire des Math\u00e9matiques'', and his story of the death of [[Archimedes]] intrigued her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}}\n\nSophie Germain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=47}} could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=90}} So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. She also enjoyed {{lang|fr|Trait\u00e9 d'Arithm\u00e9tique}} by [[\u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout]] and {{lang|fr|Le Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel}} by [[:fr:Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin|Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin]]. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\nGermain's parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics.{{sfn|Gray|1978|pp=47\u201348}} After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}\n\n===\u00c9cole Polytechnique===\n[[Image:Porton antigua sede \u00c9cole Polytechnique Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the historic building of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique]]\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] opened.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}} As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=69}} Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/sophie-germain.html |first=Simon |last=Singh |year=1997 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |title=Math's Hidden Woman |accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} and he became her mentor.{{sfn|Moncrief|2002|p=103}}\n\n==Early work in number theory==\n\n===Correspondence with Legendre===\nGermain first became interested in [[number theory]] in 1798 when [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] published {{lang|fr|Essai sur la th\u00e9orie des nombres}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. Legendre showed some of Germain's work in the {{lang|fr|Suppl\u00e9ment}} to his second edition of the {{lang|fr|Th\u00e9orie des Nombres}}, where he calls it {{lang|fr|tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse}} (\"very ingenious\"). See also [[#Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem|Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem]] below.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}}\n\n===Correspondence with Gauss===\n[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\nGermain's interest in number theory was renewed when she read [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' monumental work {{lang|la|[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]}}.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}} After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems,{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=352}} she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc,{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} to the author himself, who was one year younger than her.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=157}} The first letter, dated 21 November 1804,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} discussed Gauss' {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}} and presented some of Germain's work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]] of the form ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;7.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}} However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}}\n\nAround 1807 (sources differ),{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of [[Braunschweig]], where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety, a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} General Pernety sent a chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}} As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}\n\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=348}}  He replied:{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=349}}\n<blockquote>\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory's] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the most noble courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\n</blockquote>\n\nGauss' letters to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Olbers]] show that his praise for Germain was sincere.{{sfn|Dunnington|1955|p=67}}{{sfn|Bell|1937|p=262}} In the same 1807 letter, Sophie claimed that if <math>x^n + y^n</math> is of the form <math>h^2 + nf^2</math>, then <math>x + y</math> is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: <math>15^{11} + 8^{11}</math> can be written as <math>h^2 + 11 f^2</math>, but <math>15 + 8</math> cannot.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=733}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|1994}}\n\nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\n==Work in elasticity==\n\n===Germain's first attempt for the Academy Prize===\n[[Image:Echladni.jpg|thumb|left|Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni]]\nWhen Germain's correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning [[Ernst Chladni]]'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the Academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange's comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] deterred all but two contestants, [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Denis Poisson]] and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the Academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant,{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}} She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Lagrange was able to use Germain's work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n===Subsequent attempts for the Prize===\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} Germain's anonymous{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving [[multiple integral|double integrals]],{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\".{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384}} The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain's help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the Academy commission, had had access to her work).{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}}\n\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"{{lang|fr|Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques}}\",{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} under her own name, and on 8 January 1816{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Although Germain had at last been awarded the {{lang|fr|prix extraordinaire}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=355}} the Academy was still not fully satisfied.{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=91}} Sophie had derived the correct [[differential equation]] (a special case of the [[Kirchhoff\u2013Love_plate_theory#Isotropic_plates|Kirchhoff\u2013Love equation]]),{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} which led to incorrect boundary conditions.{{sfn|Ullmann|2007|p=31}} Here is Germain's final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\n\n: <math>N^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4 z}{\\partial y^4}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 z}{\\partial t^2} = 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''N''<sup>2</sup> is a constant.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Theory of Elasticity and of the Strength of Materials: Volume 1|author=Isaac Todhunter|editor=Karl Pearson|isbn=978-1108070423 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|page=153}}</ref><ref>This is equation (B) in Germain's own book. {{cite book|title=Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques|url=https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000|author=Sophie Germain|year=1821|page=[https://archive.org/details/TO0E039736_TO0324_PNI-1705_000000/page/27 27]}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning the Academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the Academy's tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with [[Joseph Fourier]], a secretary of the Academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}\n\n===Later work in elasticity===\n[[File:Germain - R\u00e9cherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques, 1821 - 723413.tif|thumb|{{lang|fr|R\u00e9cherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques}}, 1821]]\nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in her method.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the Academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the Academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 4}}\n\nOne further work of Germain's on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"{{lang|fr|M\u00e9moire sur la courbure des surfaces}}\". She used the [[mean curvature]] in her research (see [[Sophien|Honors in number theory]]).{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}}\n\n==Later work in number theory==\n\n===Renewed interest===\nGermain's best work was in number theory,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 1}} and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the Academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} It reawakened Germain's interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 2}}\n\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=357}} She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|pp=356\u2013357}} Germain's letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=362}}\n\n===Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem===\n[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre de Fermat]]]]\nFermat's Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers ''p'' that do not divide any of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Case 2 includes all ''p'' that divide at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"[[Sophie Germain's theorem]]\":{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}}\n<blockquote>\nLet ''p'' be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''Np''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (''N'' is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\n# if ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;0 ([[modular arithmetic|mod ''P'']]), then ''P'' divides ''xyz'', and\n# ''p'' is not a ''p''-th power residue (mod ''P'').\nThen the first case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] holds true for ''p''.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all odd primes ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;197\".{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=372}} [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|L. E. Dickson]] later used Germain's theorem to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for odd primes less than 1700.{{sfn|Dickson|1919|p=763}}\n\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled {{lang|fr|Remarque sur l'impossibilit\u00e9 de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l'\u00e9quation x<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;y<sup>p</sup>&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;z<sup>p</sup>}},{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=349}} Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat's theorem for ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\",{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}} around 40 digits long.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=371}}  Sophie did not publish this work. Her brilliant theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre's treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Legendre|Correspondence with Legendre]]).{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later.{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\",{{sfn|Del Centina|2008|page=373}} but ultimately her method did not work.{{sfn|Cipra|2008|p=899}}\n\n==Work in philosophy==\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and [[psychology]].{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=48}} She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by [[Auguste Comte]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=73}}\n\nTwo of her philosophical works, {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es diverses}} and {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur l'\u00e9tat des sciences et des lettres, aux diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques de leur culture}}, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=53}}  {{lang|fr|Pens\u00e9es}} is a history of science and mathematics with Sophie's commentary.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In {{lang|fr|Consid\u00e9rations}}, the work admired by Comte, Sophie argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the [[humanities]].{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}}\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain,{{sfn|Del Centina|2005|loc=sec. 5\u20136}} she continued to work. In 1831 ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' published her paper on the [[curvature]] of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} in <math>\\tfrac{4(x^p - 1)}{x - 1} = y^2 \\pm pz^2</math>\".{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} Mary Gray records: \"She also published in {{lang|fr|Annales de chimie et de physique}} an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\"{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=71}} On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}\n\nDespite Germain's intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"{{lang|fr|renti\u00e8re \u2013 annuitant}}\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} (property holder),{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} not a \"{{lang|fr|math\u00e9maticienne}}\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}} But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1837\u2014six years after Germain's death\u2014Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".{{sfn|Mackinnon|1990|p=347}}\n\n==Honors==\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:Grave, Sophie Germain.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Sophie Germain in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]\nGermain's resting place in the [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris is marked by a gravestone.{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=68}} <!-- The grave seems \"OK\" in the image, and the lower plaque includes a reference to the girls' school named after her, so I assume it has been kept up or replaced since the centennial mentioned next. --> At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died.

Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\".{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=49}} Germain was also included in [[H. J. Mozans]]' book \"[[Woman in Science]]\",{{sfn|Mozans|1913}} although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\".{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=201}} Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician [[Claude-Louis Navier]] as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nGermain's contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see [[Sophie Germain#Correspondence with Gauss|Correspondence with Gauss]]).\n\n===Modern praise and criticisms===\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain's work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=51}} Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young [[child prodigy|prodigy]] to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=384\u2013385}}\n\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain's theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain's work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=52}} Mozans writes, however, that when the [[Eiffel tower]] was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain's name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower's construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"{{sfn|Mozans|1913|p=156}}\n\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}}, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\"{{sfn|Sampson|1990|p=158}} Gray adds that \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\"{{sfn|Gray|1978|p=50}} Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain's creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\",{{sfn|Ogilvie|1990|p=92}} and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches.{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=385}} Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain's biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"{{sfn|Petrovich|1999|p=386}}\n\n==Germain in popular culture==\nGermain was referenced and quoted in [[David Auburn]]'s 2001 play ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]].'' The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden's [[Proof (2005 film)|film adaptation]] of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\n\nIn the fictional work \"[[The Last Theorem]]\" by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Frederik Pohl]], Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\nA new musical about Sophie Germain's life, entitled The Limit, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.\n\n==Sophie Germain Prize==\n\nThe [[Sophie Germain Prize]] ({{lang-fr|Prix Sophie Germain}}), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in Paris.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from [[Sibiu]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order_of_Leopold_(Austria)|Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics. von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in [[Bucharest]], representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"[[Volksgemeinschaft]]\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiu the \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the [[Wehrmacht]] had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to [https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schworm Karl Schworm] on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n== Author ==\nAccording to his biography on the \"Kulturportal West-Ost\", in addition to his political \"von M\u00f6ller\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of [[Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn]] (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in-chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw\u00e4bische Volksgemeinschaft'.\u201d\n\nvon M\u00f6ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. von M\u00f6ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\" he wrote in his Gazette \"The Striker\". In his two-volume work \"How the Swabian communities came into being\" (Timi\u0219oara 1923\u201324), M\u00f6ller 1924 \"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. \n\nIn the novel \u201cDie Werschetzer Tat\u201d (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \" Aryan race\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \"foreign people\": The Germans \"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\" (1937) von M\u00f6ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107. As in \"The Werschetzer act\" must also in this novel the \"Aryan\" hero \"against their racial opponent\" claim.\n\nIn the novel \"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\" (1938) M\u00f6ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \"real Banat farmers\" after generations. \n\nvon M\u00f6ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the [[Eher-Verlag]] of the [[NSDAP]].\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, [[Hitler_cabinet|Reich Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] expressed his thanks to the nation.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat. Together they had two children, Karlheinz and Erich\n\n==Involvement in Nazism==\nAt the beginning of 1931, he returned to public life, becoming the chief editor of the German-language Jimbolia newspaper, [[\"Hatzfelder Zeitung\"]], and president of the local ethnic community. M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M\u00f6ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \"Gauleiter\" for the Banat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">= Aspects</ref>\n\nAfter Karl von M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in Timi\u0219oara. It was an imitation of the publication [[Der St\u00fcrmer]] published in Germany by the German Nazi [[Julius Streicher]] who, after World War II, was sentenced to death in the first of the [[Nuremberg trials]], found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]] and executed by [[hanging]] in 1946.<ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, Divers, 2003 [http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034205/http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, in: Cultural Observatory, Nr. 197 \u2013 December 2, 2003, [http://www.observatorcultural.com/Germanii-din-Romania-intre-nazism-si-stalinism*articleID_9752-articles_details.html] and Errata.

Roman. M\u00f6ller, Karl von: 6480BB}}</ref> was an officer, journalist, author and politician from [[Banat]]. He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from [[Sibiu]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics. von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in [[Bucharest]], representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"[[Volksgemeinschaft]]\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiu the \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the [[Wehrmacht]] had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to [https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schworm Karl Schworm] on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n== Author ==\nAccording to his biography on the \"Kulturportal West-Ost\", in addition to his political \"von M\u00f6ller\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of [[Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn]] (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in-chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw\u00e4bische Volksgemeinschaft'.\u201d\n\nvon M\u00f6ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. von M\u00f6ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\" he wrote in his Gazette \"The Striker\". In his two-volume work \"How the Swabian communities came into being\" (Timi\u0219oara 1923\u201324), M\u00f6ller 1924 \"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. \n\nIn the novel \u201cDie Werschetzer Tat\u201d (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \" Aryan race\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \"foreign people\": The Germans \"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\" (1937) von M\u00f6ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107. As in \"The Werschetzer act\" must also in this novel the \"Aryan\" hero \"against their racial opponent\" claim.\n\nIn the novel \"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\" (1938) M\u00f6ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \"real Banat farmers\" after generations. \n\nvon M\u00f6ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the [[Eher-Verlag]] of the [[NSDAP]].\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, [[Hitler_cabinet|Reich Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] expressed his thanks to the nation.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat. Together they had two children, Karlheinz and Erich\n\n==Involvement in Nazism==\nAt the beginning of 1931, he returned to public life, becoming the chief editor of the German-language Jimbolia newspaper, [[\"Hatzfelder Zeitung\"]], and president of the local ethnic community. M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M\u00f6ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \"Gauleiter\" for the Banat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">= Aspects</ref>\n\nAfter Karl von M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in Timi\u0219oara. It was an imitation of the publication [[Der St\u00fcrmer]] published in Germany by the German Nazi [[Julius Streicher]] who, after World War II, was sentenced to death in the first of the [[Nuremberg trials]], found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]] and executed by [[hanging]] in 1946.<ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, Divers, 2003 [http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034205/http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, in: Cultural Observatory, Nr. 197 \u2013 December 2, 2003, [http://www.observatorcultural.com/Germanii-din-Romania-intre-nazism-si-stalinism*articleID_9752-articles_details.html] and Errata.

Nelson convinced the convent to sell the lid to him for \u00a3120. The box and its lid were reunited for the first time in at least a century and possibly much longer.\n\nNelson lent the box to the V&A where it remained on exhibit from 1937 until his death in 1953.

After Nelson's death the reliquary was sold to an American dealer, and subsequently to The Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\n==Description==\nThe casket is a rare, possibly unique, example of high-quality Anglo Saxon wood carving, dating from c. 1050. It is decorated with scenes from Christ's life. On one long side, the Christ child rests in the manger. Above, the Crucifixion is shown with mourners gathered below the cross and two angels flanking it on either side. On the other long side is the Ascension, God's hand pulling Christ heavenward. Christ in Majesty appears above. The short sides show Christ\u2019s entry into Jerusalem and the other his baptism though it is possibly first bath at the hands of the Emea (midwife) and [[Salome]]. It has a similar design influence to the [[Hereford Gospels]] and Troper, where the figures are said to resemble one another stylistically<ref>{{cite book|last1=Backhouse |first1=Janet |author1-link=Janet Backhouse |last2=Turner |first2=D.H. |author2-link=D.

It is missing its lock and one hinge. The remaining hinge is made from a copper alloy.\nThis type of portable house-shrine was based on the earliest classical form of full-sized [[wikt:feretory|feretory]] or sarcophagus, aptly denominated by early medieval witnesses as a domunculus\n\u2013 or domuncula as in [[Bede]] \u2013 i.e. \u2018little house\u2019 \u2013 or even tugurium \u2018hut\u2019, which in the case of [[Chad of Mercia|St Chad]]\u2019s shrine alluded to by Bede was made of wood rather than stone.\nThe portable form, suitable for displaying on an altar, is well represented in Anglo-Saxon art by the hip-roofed Uttoxeter casket.\n\n[[Catherine Karkov]], in her book ''The Art of Anglo Saxon England'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Karkov|first1=Catherine|title=The Art of Anglo Saxon England|publisher=Boydell|isbn=1783270950|pages=348|edition=Reprint edition (17 Mar. 2016)}}</ref> suggests that if the box is a reliquary, the way in which the figure of Christ appears centrally suggests it may have held a relic from one of the events of Christ\u2019s life.

The box and its lid were reunited for the first time in at least a century and possibly much longer.\n\nNelson lent the box to the V&A where it remained on exhibit from 1937 until his death in 1953.  He published an article on it in the academic publication ''[[Archaeologia (London)|Archaeologia]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Philip|title=IV.\u2014An Ancient Box-Wood Casket|journal=Archaeologia|date=January 1937|volume=86|pages=91\u2013100}}</ref> in 1937.  After Nelson's death the reliquary was sold to an American dealer, and subsequently to The Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\n==Description==\nThe casket is a rare, possibly unique, example of high-quality Anglo Saxon wood carving, dating from c. 1050. It is decorated with scenes from Christ's life. On one long side, the Christ child rests in the manger. Above, the Crucifixion is shown with mourners gathered below the cross and two angels flanking it on either side. On the other long side is the Ascension, God's hand pulling Christ heavenward. Christ in Majesty appears above. The short sides show Christ\u2019s entry into Jerusalem and the other his baptism though it is possibly first bath at the hands of the Emea (midwife) and [[Salome]]. It has a similar design influence to the [[Hereford Gospels]] and Troper, where the figures are said to resemble one another stylistically<ref>{{cite book|last1=Backhouse |first1=Janet |author1-link=Janet Backhouse |last2=Turner |first2=D.H. |author2-link=D.

As the box is made of wood, a piece of the [[True Cross]] would have been especially appropriate.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Franks Casket]], an earlier Anglo-Saxon casket in bone\n*[[Brescia Casket]], earlier Italian ivory casket\n\n==External links==\n* [http://library.clevelandart.org/node/291669 Dr. Nelson's Boxwood Casket] at the Cleveland Museum of Art\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/27305838@N04/10497026543 Photograph]\n\n[[Category:Anglo-Saxon art]]\n[[Category:Christian reliquaries]]\n[[Category:History of Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:19th-century archaeological discoveries]]\n[[Category:Collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Saxon archaeology]]\n[[Category:Uttoxeter]]\n", "name_user": "Cosmicdense", "label": "safe", "comment": "specific link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttoxeter_Casket"}
