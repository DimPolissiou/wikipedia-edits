FaceTime for {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} was announced on October 20, 2010.\n\nOn March 2, 2011, FaceTime support was announced for the newly introduced [[iPad 2]], which had forward- and rear-facing cameras.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, FaceTime left beta and was listed in the [[Mac App Store]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]0.99. Apple claims that it intended to provide the application free of charge, however, a provision of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] (2002) bars companies from providing an unadvertised new feature of an already-sold product without enduring \"onerous accounting measures\".<ref name=\"Macgasm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.macgasm.net/2011/02/24/apple-charge-facetime|title=Apple charges for FaceTime|last=Macgasm|date=|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> {{As of|2017|12}}, the US$0.99 beta is still available for download from Apple.<ref name=\"softpedia FT beta\">{{cite web|url=http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/FaceTime.shtml|title=Mac|date=|publisher=Softpedia|at=link within last sentence \"The page provides access to FaceTime 0.9 Build 92 version\"|accessdate=}}</ref> FaceTime is included for free in macOS from {{nowrap|[[Mac OS X Lion]]}} (10.7) onwards and iOS.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[AT&T]] allowed customers to use FaceTime as long as they were [[tiered internet|tiered]], but blocked the application from working for customers with unlimited data plans.

Even though FaceTime worked only over 3G at that time, it now supports 4G LTE calls on networks all over the world, availability being limited to operators' GSM plans.<ref name=\":1\">zaone [https://www.idevice.ro/2012/05/18/ios-5-1-1-ne-demonstreaza-ca-apple-va-permite-efectuarea-de-apeluri-facetime-prin-3g/ \"iOS 5.1.1 ne demonstreaza ca Apple va permite efectuarea de apeluri FaceTime prin 3G\"], \"iDevice.ro\", May 2011</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Apple announced that FaceTime would support group video and audio calls with up to 32 people in [[iOS 12]] and [[macOS Mojave]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/04/apple-facetime-group-chat-ios-12/|title=Apple's FaceTime offers group chats for up to 32 people|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Implementation==\n {{Update|part= FaceTime group calling|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[iPhone]]'s screen when a call is in progress, showing the FaceTime button (grayed out, middle of bottom row).]]\n\nFaceTime works by establishing a connection between two supported devices. Most Apple devices (such as iPhones, iPads and Macs) introduced after 2011 support FaceTime. FaceTime is currently incompatible with non-Apple devices or any other video calling services. Mac models introduced in 2011 have high-definition video FaceTime, which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera.\n\nUnlike Mac OS X's [[iChat]], FaceTime currently does not support group conferencing but support has been announced for iOS 12. The application is a one-on-one video chat\u2014only two people can talk at once. If a second user calls and the user answers, the video chat with the previous user ends and a new video session begins with the second caller. In iPhone, if a phone call is pending and the user attempts to answer, the video call ends and the phone call begins with the next user.\n\nIncoming notifications on iOS devices are shown during a FaceTime call, but if they are opened, the video will be temporarily paused until the user is back in the FaceTime app. \n[[File:Paused FaceTime.png|thumbnail|left|Paused FaceTime Screen|219x219px]]\n\nOn the iPhone, a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button or initiated FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application. iOS 7 and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app, as there always has been on Apple's non-telephony devices: iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac.\n\nUntil the release of iOS 6, FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work. From iOS 6 onwards, FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks ([[3G]] or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) provided the carrier enabled it, which by mid-2013 virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed. FaceTime Audio uses about three [[megabyte]]s of data for every five minutes of conversation, with FaceTime Video using significantly more.<ref name=\"IW data usage 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/974213|title=How much data does FaceTime audio calling use?|publisher=iPhoneFAQ|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> Cellular talk time/minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call.\n\nFaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service. A single email address can be registered to multiple devices and a call placed to that address rings all devices simultaneously.\n\n==Standards==\nThe FaceTime protocol is based on numerous open industry standards<ref name=\"AppleInsider standards 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/08/inside_iphone_4_facetime_video_calling.html|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=June 9, 2010|title=Inside iPhone 4: FaceTime video calling|publisher=[[Apple community#AppleInsider|AppleInsider]]|author=Daniel Eran Dilger}}</ref> although it is not interoperable with other videotelephony systems:\n\n* [[H.264]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]-ELD \u2013 video and audio [[codec]]s respectively.\n* [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] \u2013 [[IETF]] signaling protocol for [[VoIP]].\n* [[Session Traversal Utilities for NAT|STUN]], [[Traversal Using Relay NAT|TURN]] and [[Interactive Connectivity Establishment|ICE]] \u2013 IETF technologies for traversing [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Network address translation|NAT]].\n* [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] and [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol|SRTP]] \u2013 IETF standards for delivering real-time and encrypted media streams for VoIP.\n\nUpon the launch of the iPhone 4, Jobs stated that Apple would immediately start working with standards bodies to make the FaceTime protocol an \"open industry standard\".

As an audio-only version of FaceTime, it effectively makes the protocol into a [[voice over IP|voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP), that competes with other mainstream providers in the field, including [[Skype]] ([[Microsoft]]).\n\nBased on the same [[AAC-LD]] audio protocol, the service provides high-quality audio. The iOS 7 betas limited FaceTime Audio to calls placed on a Wi-Fi network (the same original limitation of the video version of FaceTime), but the final release has removed that restriction to allow it to work over 3G and LTE data connections, as is the case with most carriers and plans with regard to FaceTime with video. Like the video version, FaceTime Audio is currently only available between Apple devices. The feature is not available to run on the [[iPod Touch]] 4th generation as the device does not support iOS 7 or later. FaceTime streaming over cellular data is unavailable for the [[iPhone 4]] and the [[iPad 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4319|title=Use FaceTime with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Limited availability==\n\n===By country===\n{{As of|2010|June|df=}}, FaceTime is not enabled on devices bought in the [[United Arab Emirates]] possibly due to regulations in this country that restrict IP-based communications.

In August 2019, FaceTime is available for iPhones in [[Pakistan]] upon updating to iOS 12.4.\n\n===By iOS version===\nAs of April 16, 2014, FaceTime ceased working on earlier versions of iOS which had previously supported it (iOS 4, 5 & 6). This was because the client-side certificate used to authenticate a genuine Apple device with FaceTime servers (amongst other uses<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chasechristian.com/blog/2014/04/ios-client-certificate-expiration-april-16-2014/ |publisher=Chase Christian Blog|date=April 21, 2014 |accessdate=February 24, 2016|title=iOS Client Certificate Expiration - April 16, 2014}}</ref>) expired on that date. Apple chose not to release an update to this certificate for all devices for which a newer major iOS version (with a new, valid certificate) was available.

Apple claims that it intended to provide the application free of charge, however, a provision of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] (2002) bars companies from providing an unadvertised new feature of an already-sold product without enduring \"onerous accounting measures\".<ref name=\"Macgasm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.macgasm.net/2011/02/24/apple-charge-facetime|title=Apple charges for FaceTime|last=Macgasm|date=|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> {{As of|2017|12}}, the US$0.99 beta is still available for download from Apple.<ref name=\"softpedia FT beta\">{{cite web|url=http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/FaceTime.shtml|title=Mac|date=|publisher=Softpedia|at=link within last sentence \"The page provides access to FaceTime 0.9 Build 92 version\"|accessdate=}}</ref> FaceTime is included for free in macOS from {{nowrap|[[Mac OS X Lion]]}} (10.7) onwards and iOS.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[AT&T]] allowed customers to use FaceTime as long as they were [[tiered internet|tiered]], but blocked the application from working for customers with unlimited data plans.

Even though FaceTime worked only over 3G at that time, it now supports 4G LTE calls on networks all over the world, availability being limited to operators' GSM plans.<ref name=\":1\">zaone [https://www.idevice.ro/2012/05/18/ios-5-1-1-ne-demonstreaza-ca-apple-va-permite-efectuarea-de-apeluri-facetime-prin-3g/ \"iOS 5.1.1 ne demonstreaza ca Apple va permite efectuarea de apeluri FaceTime prin 3G\"], \"iDevice.ro\", May 2011</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Apple announced that FaceTime would support group video and audio calls with up to 32 people in [[iOS 12]] and [[macOS Mojave]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/04/apple-facetime-group-chat-ios-12/|title=Apple's FaceTime offers group chats for up to 32 people|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Implementation==\n {{Update|part= FaceTime group calling|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[iPhone]]'s screen when a call is in progress, showing the FaceTime button (grayed out, middle of bottom row).]]\n\nFaceTime works by establishing a connection between two supported devices. Most Apple devices (such as iPhones, iPads and Macs) introduced after 2011 support FaceTime. FaceTime is currently incompatible with non-Apple devices or any other video calling services. Mac models introduced in 2011 have high-definition video FaceTime, which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera.\n\nUnlike Mac OS X's [[iChat]], FaceTime currently does not support group conferencing but support has been announced for iOS 12. The application is a one-on-one video chat\u2014only two people can talk at once. If a second user calls and the user answers, the video chat with the previous user ends and a new video session begins with the second caller. In iPhone, if a phone call is pending and the user attempts to answer, the video call ends and the phone call begins with the next user.\n\nIncoming notifications on iOS devices are shown during a FaceTime call, but if they are opened, the video will be temporarily paused until the user is back in the FaceTime app. \n[[File:Paused FaceTime.png|thumbnail|left|Paused FaceTime Screen|219x219px]]\n\nOn the iPhone, a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button or initiated FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application. iOS 7 and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app, as there always has been on Apple's non-telephony devices: iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac.\n\nUntil the release of iOS 6, FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work. From iOS 6 onwards, FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks ([[3G]] or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) provided the carrier enabled it, which by mid-2013 virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed. FaceTime Audio uses about three [[megabyte]]s of data for every five minutes of conversation, with FaceTime Video using significantly more.<ref name=\"IW data usage 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/974213|title=How much data does FaceTime audio calling use?|publisher=iPhoneFAQ|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> Cellular talk time/minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call.\n\nFaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service.

As an audio-only version of FaceTime, it effectively makes the protocol into a [[voice over IP|voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP), that competes with other mainstream providers in the field, including [[Skype]] ([[Microsoft]]).\n\nBased on the same [[AAC-LD]] audio protocol, the service provides high-quality audio. The iOS 7 betas limited FaceTime Audio to calls placed on a Wi-Fi network (the same original limitation of the video version of FaceTime), but the final release has removed that restriction to allow it to work over 3G and LTE data connections, as is the case with most carriers and plans with regard to FaceTime with video. Like the video version, FaceTime Audio is currently only available between Apple devices. The feature is not available to run on the [[iPod Touch]] 4th generation as the device does not support iOS 7 or later.

Maynes of [[North Tonawanda]], [[New York (state)|New York]] who dubbed it the Caterpillar when it debuted in [[Coney Island]], NY in 1925.  It generates a significant amount of centrifugal force, causing the riders on the inside of the seats to crush the riders on the outside of the seats. It was once found at nearly every amusement park around the USA, but is now so rare that an original Caterpillar ride can only be found operating in two parks today. Though only two Caterpillars are known to be operating, there have been reports claiming there are additional Caterpillars in storage or standing (but not operating) at a few other parks.\n\nThe ride features a complete circuit of motorized vehicles which are connected end-to-end all the way around the ride, in a manner similar to a [[Music Express]]. Also, the cars travel a circular, undulating (wave-like) track very similar to that of a [[Tumble Bug]]. This ride is famous for its usually green canopy (one previously located at [[Geauga Lake]] had a yellow and black canopy) that automatically, or manually in the case of Heritage Park's, begins to slowly surround the cars and fully encapsulate them once the ride reaches its maximum velocity, though DelGrosso's indoor version called Space Odyssey operated without it. When covered with the canopy, the ride tends to look like a caterpillar, which is probably how Mr. Maynes got the name for his ride. A high powered fan located at one point under the carriage of the ride, was traditionally used to surprise riders with a blast of air as the cars go around the track.\n\nThe Caterpillar most likely served as Moser Rides' inspiration for the popular [[Music Express]] (sometimes Musik Express or Himalaya) style ride.\n\nThe Amor Express is a caterpillar / Musik Express hybrid variant made by SDC.

After the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured constantly. Near the end of the Disclaimer Tour, they decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on a world tour with [[Evanescence]]. \"Fine Again\" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080\u00b0 Avalanche]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an [[Evanescence]] worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled \"Sold Me\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

Do NOT change to \"is\" Addl NOTE: only in Afrikaans; though traditional English is a minority language, it still is based on UK English--> a South African [[Rock music|rock]] band founded in 1999 in [[Pretoria]], [[Gauteng]]. The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as sarin gas.\n\nSeether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single \"[[Fine Again]]\", and their success was sustained in 2004 with the single \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They have experienced continued success with number one hits on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, such as \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\", \"[[Words as Weapons (Seether song)|Words as Weapons]]\", and \"[[Let You Down (Seether song)|Let You Down]]\". The band currently consists of lead vocalist/guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist [[Dale Stewart]], drummer John Humphrey and guitarist [[Corey Lowery]]. Seether has undergone several changes since their formation in 1999, with vocalist/guitarist Shaun Morgan and bassist/vocalist Dale Stewart, being the only constant members while John Humphrey has been their longtime drummer since joining the band in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation as Saron Gas (1999\u20132001)===\nThe band formed in [[South Africa]] in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\">{{cite web|author=Bradley Torreano |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seether-mn0000625731/biography |title=Seether &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-03-19}}</ref> Consisting of [[frontman]], vocalist, and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, ''Fragile'', in 2000 under [[Johannesburg]]-based [[independent record label]] Musketeer Records.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Despite the region's focus primarily on [[pop music|pop]] and [[indigenous music]], the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label [[Wind-up Records]], who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in [[North America]].<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to [[sarin gas]], and switched to calling themselves [[Seether (song)|Seether]], after the [[Veruca Salt]] song.<ref name=\"AXS1\">[https://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Disclaimer'' releases (2002\u20132004) ===\nIn August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, ''Disclaimer'', which earned the band three singles: \"[[Fine Again]]\", \"[[Driven Under]]\", and \"[[Gasoline (Seether song)|Gasoline]]\", in which only the first managed significant success. After the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured constantly. Near the end of the Disclaimer Tour, they decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on a world tour with [[Evanescence]]. \"Fine Again\" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080\u00b0 Avalanche]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an [[Evanescence]] worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled \"Sold Me\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.\n\nMorgan has stated that the reworking of \"Broken\" was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band.<ref name=fastloud>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |title=Seether feels the cold on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051304/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs [[remix]]ed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled ''[[Disclaimer II]]''. The alternate version also featured eight extra tracks.\n\n===''Karma and Effect'' (2005\u20132006)===\nSeether's follow-up album, ''[[Karma and Effect]]'', was released in May 2005. Originally titled ''Catering to Cowards'', the name was changed at the record label's demand.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |title=Seether : Seether Frontman Shaun Morgan Is Very Angry |publisher=VH1.com |accessdate=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901033029/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |archivedate=1 September 2009 }}</ref> ''Karma and Effect'' debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 album charts and was certified gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Truth (Seether song)|Truth]]\", and \"[[The Gift (Seether song)|The Gift]]\". \"Remedy\" reached number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts, Seether's first number 1 hit.\n\nSeether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled ''[[One Cold Night]]'', recorded at the Grape Street Club in [[Philadelphia]], on 22 February 2006. Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of \"Needles\" and \"Burrito\" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seether|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/seether-tickets/index.html|publisher=Frontrowking.com|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nGuitarist [[Patrick Callahan]]'s departure from the band was announced in June 15, 2006.

Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. [[Shaun Morgan]] himself later commented on Pat's departure:\n:\"''Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.''\"<ref name=fastloud/>\n\nMorgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was \"dependence on a combination of substances\" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with [[Staind]] and [[Three Days Grace]].<ref name=\"MTV2007\">{{cite web |title=Seether Frontman Enters Rehab; August Tour Dates Canceled - MTV |author=Chris Harris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |date=26 Jul 2006 |accessdate=15 Sep 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' (2007\u20132009)===\nShaun Morgan, prior to the next album's release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. ''[[Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces]]'' was slated for an August 2007 release but was delayed until 23 October 2007 due to the [[suicide]] of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured \"Candice the Ghost\", and was illustrated by [[David Ho (artist)|David Ho]]. The first single, \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for [[WWE]]'s [[No Way Out (2008)]]. \"[[Rise Above This]]\", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on its mainstream counterpart.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} The final single from the album was \"Breakdown\", the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of October 23. ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' won Seether's first [[South African Music Awards|South African Music Award]] in the category \"Best Rock: English\", as well as their first [[MTV Africa Music Awards|MTV Africa Music Award]] for \"Best Alternative Artist\".\n\nA tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. [[Troy McLawhorn]] of [[Dark New Day]], [[Evanescence]], and [[doubleDrive]] was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008.

McLawhorn was afterwards made an official member of the band.\n\n\"No Shelter\" appeared on the [[NCIS (Soundtrack)|NCIS Official TV Soundtrack]], released on 10 February 2009, and a version of [[Wham!]]'s \"[[Careless Whisper]]\" was made available for purchase as a digital or mobile download.
