However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}).<ref name=\"trailer\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nThe players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first nine players were revealed on ''The Circle France''{{'}}s [[Instagram]] profile.<ref>{{cite web |author1=@circlegame |title=Qui d'autre ne peut pas attendre! \ud83d\ude4c regardez les joueurs entrer dans The Circle Tomorrow sur @NetflixFR |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-tq9EsAU9X/ |website=instagram.com |publisher=Instagram |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

Instead, the two lowest rated players were at risk and were the only ones that could be blocked. The five other players, excluding Edmundo & Jo\u00e3o had to decide which of the two would be blocked. Romain, Maxime and Rudy chose to block C\u00e9dric, and Ines and Gary chose to block \u00c9l\u00e9a. Since C\u00e9dric received more votes, he was blocked.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: In Episode 9, the ratings were not published. Instead, the highest-rated player automatically became the \"Superinfluencer\", who could make the sole decision on whom to block.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: In Episode 10, there were no Influencers. Instead, the least popular player was instantly blocked.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\nJoe Keller from ''[[Decider (website)|Decider]]'', in a regular series called \"Stream It or Skip It\", told his audience to stream it. His reasons include that the format is still solid and the gist of the show is still fresh, despite four previous [[The Circle (franchise)|international seasons]]. However, he does comment that the cast is lacking in diversity, especially since this season aired after the \"[[Human sexuality|sexually-fluid]]\" cast of the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Netflix title|81044719}}\n* [https://www.instagram.com/circlegame/ @circlegame] on [[Instagram]]\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n{{The Circle (franchise)|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Circle French TV Series}}\n[[Category:2010s reality television series]]\n[[Category:French reality television series]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:French-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:The Circle (TV series)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|French reality television show}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name             = The Circle France\n| image                 = The Circle France.png\n| caption               = The official title screen for ''The Circle France''.\n| genre                 = [[Reality television|Reality competition]]\n| creative_director     = \n| presenter             = ''None''\n| narrated              = \n| country               = [[France]]\n| theme_music_composer  = \n| opentheme             = \n| language              = French\n| num_series            = 1\n| num_episodes          = 12\n| executive_producer    = \n| camera                = \n| runtime               = 37\u201351 minutes\n| channel               = [[Netflix]]\n| company               = [[Studio Lambert]]\n| distributor           = \n| picture_format        = \n| audio_format          = \n| released              = {{Start date|2020|4|9|df=yes}}\n| related               = {{Plainlist|\n* ''[[The Circle (British TV series)|The Circle UK]]''\n* ''[[The Circle (American TV series)|The Circle US]]''\n* ''[[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|The Circle Brazil]]''\n}}\n| website               = https://www.thecirclecasting.com/the-circle-france\n}}\n\n'''''The Circle France''''' (also known as '''''The Circle Game''''' in [[France]])<ref name=\"trailer\">{{cite web |title=Season 1 Trailer: The Circle France |url=https://www.netflix.com/watch/81189754?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C0%2C30a8b6b7-19b1-47c5-82ed-01092634917d-7331629%2C%2C&t=0 |website=netflix.com |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=26 March 2020 |language=French |date=26 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> is a French [[Reality television|reality competition]] show, produced by [[Studio Lambert]] and Motion Content Group which first aired on [[Netflix]] in 9 April 2020 that is based on a [[The Circle (British TV series)|British TV series of the same name]].<ref name=\"deadline\">{{cite web |last1=White |first1=Peter |title='The Circle': Netflix Lines Up French & Brazilian Remakes As Studio Lambert Uses UK Hub For Reality Format |url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/the-circle-netflix-france-brazil-1202519369/ |website=deadline.com |publisher=Deadline |accessdate=16 October 2019 |date=18 December 2018}}</ref> Along with ''The Circle France'', Netflix also released separate versions of ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' in the [[United States]] and [[Brazil]].<ref name=\"hollywood_reporter\">{{cite web |last1=Elise Sandberg |first1=Bryn |title=Netflix to Adapt U.K. Reality Series 'The Circle' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflix-adapt-uk-reality-series-circle-1150330 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref> The show bills itself as a game based around social media, with the concept that \"anyone can be anyone in ''The Circle''\".

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}).<ref name=\"trailer\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nThe players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first nine players were revealed on ''The Circle France''{{'}}s [[Instagram]] profile.<ref>{{cite web |author1=@circlegame |title=Qui d'autre ne peut pas attendre! \ud83d\ude4c regardez les joueurs entrer dans The Circle Tomorrow sur @NetflixFR |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-tq9EsAU9X/ |website=instagram.com |publisher=Instagram |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

He began to work on ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people.

The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on.

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

Instead, the two lowest rated players were at risk and were the only ones that could be blocked. The five other players, excluding Edmundo & Jo\u00e3o had to decide which of the two would be blocked. Romain, Maxime and Rudy chose to block C\u00e9dric, and Ines and Gary chose to block \u00c9l\u00e9a. Since C\u00e9dric received more votes, he was blocked.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: In Episode 9, the ratings were not published. Instead, the highest-rated player automatically became the \"Superinfluencer\", who could make the sole decision on whom to block.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: In Episode 10, there were no Influencers. Instead, the least popular player was instantly blocked.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\nJoe Keller from ''[[Decider (webiste)|Desider]]'', in a regular series called \"Stream It or Skip It\", told his audience to stream it. His reasons include that the format is still solid and the gist of the show is still fresh, despite four previous [[The Circle (franchise)|international seasons]]. However, he does comment that the cast is lacking in diversity, especially since this season aired after the \"[[Human sexuality|sexually-fluid]]\" cast of the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Netflix title|81044719}}\n* [https://www.instagram.com/circlegame/ @circlegame] on [[Instagram]]\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n{{The Circle (franchise)|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Circle French TV Series}}\n[[Category:2010s reality television series]]\n[[Category:French reality television series]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:French-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:The Circle (TV series)]]\n", "name_user": "Jayab314", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(French_TV_series)"}

The most Retinger was able to achieve was to push through the [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]], signed on 30 July 1941, which provided for the formation of the [[Anders' army]], thus ridding Stalin of the immediate human problem posed by the hundreds of thousands of Polish [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s and deportees from the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|Soviet occupied]] [[Kresy Zachodnie|Kresy]] regions of the former [[Second Polish Republic]], who after an arduous odyssey across thousands of miles would eventually end up as the [[United Kingdom]]'s human problem.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anders, Lt.-General W\u0142adys\u0142aw|title= An Army in Exile|publisher= MacMillan & Co.
