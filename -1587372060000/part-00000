To illustrate this, consider the following example.\n\nThere are three bidders with only two possible slots. The values of\neach bidders 1, 2, and 3 are $10, $5, and $3 respectively. Suppose that the first slot click\nthrough rate (CTR) is 300 and the second slot CTR is 290. If bidder 1 is truthful, he\nwould have to pay <math>p_1 = \\$5(300) = \\$1500</math> for a utility of <math>u_1 = \\$10(300)-\\$1500 = \\$1500</math>.\nHowever, if bidder 1 decides to lie and reports a value of $4 instead then his utility\nwould be <math>u_2 = \\$10(290) - \\$3(290) = \\$2030</math>. Notice that <math>u_2 > u_1</math> which makes GSP\nuntruthful and bidders have an incentive to lie.\n\n====Quality Variant====\nGoogle uses a minor variant of GSP to auction off advertisement slots. Potential\nadvertisements may be of varying quality. Suppose that there are two advertisements\nfor eggs. One advertisement simply fills its space with the word \u201cegg\u201d repeated over\nand over, while the other advertisement shows a picture of eggs, contains branding\ninformation, and mentions positive qualities about their eggs, such as cage-freeness.\nThe second advertisement may be thought of as having higher quality than the first\nadvertisement, being more useful to consumers, more likely to be clicked on, and more\nlikely to generate revenue for both the advertiser and Google. Advertisements that\nhave a history of high click through rates, are geographically targeted at the user, or\nhave a high quality landing page may also be thought of as having higher quality.<ref>Google AdWords, Check and understand Quality Score. support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454010</ref>\n\nGoogle assigns a numeric \u201cquality\u201d score <math>\\gamma_i</math> to each bidder <math>i</math>.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 8,330.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1323536| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Doraville city, Georgia| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=October 21, 2015}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nDoraville was incorporated by an act of the [[Georgia General Assembly]], approved December 15, 1871.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/d.pdf | title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | page=63 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref> From its development until the 1940s, Doraville was a small agricultural community that served the interests of a larger surrounding farming area.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Doraville was on a main railroad line and had a new water system. [[General Motors]] selected Doraville for a new assembly plant. Doraville grew in the late 1940s and the 1950s as a result. In the late 1940s, plans for Guilford Village, the first subdivision, were announced by Southern Builders and Engineering Company. The 112-home subdivision at Tilly Mill and Flowers Roads was to cover some 58 acres. In 1950, Doraville's population was 472. By 1964, its population was 6,160 and its land area was 1,722 acres. Part of the population growth during that period was because of the annexation of Northwoods in 1949 and Oakcliff in 1958.\n\nBy the 1980s, Doraville and neighboring Chamblee attracted immigrants relocating to the Atlanta area who settled along [[Buford Highway]]. The result is one of the largest Asian communities in the country. Many Latin American countries are also represented. 56% of residents speak a language other than English as a first language. The [[Doraville (MARTA station)|Doraville MARTA Station]] was built in 1992, destroying the few buildings that remained of Doraville's downtown. The GM [[Doraville Assembly]] Plant closed in 2009 and was demolished in 2015.\n\n==Geography==\nDoraville is located at {{Coord|33|54|19|N|84|16|26|W|type:city}} (33.905302, -84.273870).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Doraville is northeast of [[Chamblee, Georgia|Chamblee]], southeast of [[Dunwoody, Georgia|Dunwoody]], southwest of [[Norcross, Georgia|Norcross]] and [[Peachtree Corners]], and northwest of [[Tucker, Georgia|Tucker]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.01|sqkm|order=flip|3}}, or 0.11%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> Crooked Creek, a tributary of the [[Chattahoochee River]], runs through Doraville.\n\nThe City of Doraville is located in DeKalb County.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 103\n|1910= 147\n|1920= 152\n|1930= 195\n|1940= 300\n|1950= 472\n|1960= 4437\n|1970= 9157\n|1980= 7414\n|1990= 7626\n|2000= 9862\n|2010= 8330\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10526\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,862 people, 2,998 households, and 1,981 families residing in the city.

Many small ethnic restaurants can be found along Buford Highway and Peachtree Industrial Blvd.\n\nDoraville is the corporate home of [[Big Green Egg]] and [[Serta Simmons Bedding]]. Serta Simmons is in a tax allocation district and does not pay taxes to the city or contribute to the city's general fund. Alarmingly, more than one hundred businesses along the west side of Buford Highway were also taken off the city's tax roll during Mayor Pittman's term and placed in the TAD further decreasing the city's general fund contributions. The city continues to increase the annual budgets and is nearing bankruptcy. Lawsuits for policing for-profit and legislating morality have cost taxpayers nearly one million dollars.\n\n==Government==\nDoraville has a [[council\u2013manager government]], consisting of a [[city manager]], [[city council]], and [[mayor]].

[[General Motors]] selected Doraville for a new assembly plant. Doraville grew in the late 1940s and the 1950s as a result. In the late 1940s, plans for Guilford Village, the first subdivision, were announced by Southern Builders and Engineering Company. The 112-home subdivision at Tilly Mill and Flowers Roads was to cover some 58 acres. In 1950, Doraville's population was 472. By 1964, its population was 6,160 and its land area was 1,722 acres. Part of the population growth during that period was because of the annexation of Northwoods in 1949 and Oakcliff in 1958.\n\nBy the 1980s, Doraville and neighboring Chamblee attracted immigrants relocating to the Atlanta area who settled along [[Buford Highway]]. The result is one of the largest Asian communities in the country. Many Latin American countries are also represented. 56% of residents speak a language other than English as a first language. The [[Doraville (MARTA station)|Doraville MARTA Station]] was built in 1992, destroying the few buildings that remained of Doraville's downtown. The GM [[Doraville Assembly]] Plant closed in 2009 and was demolished in 2015.\n\n==Geography==\nDoraville is located at {{Coord|33|54|19|N|84|16|26|W|type:city}} (33.905302, -84.273870).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Doraville is northeast of [[Chamblee, Georgia|Chamblee]], southeast of [[Dunwoody, Georgia|Dunwoody]], southwest of [[Norcross, Georgia|Norcross]] and [[Peachtree Corners]], and northwest of [[Tucker, Georgia|Tucker]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.01|sqkm|order=flip|3}}, or 0.11%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> Crooked Creek, a tributary of the [[Chattahoochee River]], runs through Doraville.\n\nThe City of Doraville is located in DeKalb County.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 103\n|1910= 147\n|1920= 152\n|1930= 195\n|1940= 300\n|1950= 472\n|1960= 4437\n|1970= 9157\n|1980= 7414\n|1990= 7626\n|2000= 9862\n|2010= 8330\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10526\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,862 people, 2,998 households, and 1,981 families residing in the city.

Serta Simmons is in a tax allocation district and does not pay taxes to the city or contribute to the city's general fund. Alarmingly, more than one hundred businesses along the west side of Buford Highway were also taken off the city's tax roll during Mayor Pittman's term and placed in the TAD further decreasing the city's general fund contributions. The city continues to increase the annual budgets and is nearing bankruptcy.

That production marked her [[off-Broadway]] debut. Several months later, Turner made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut as Judith Hastings in ''[[Gemini (play)|Gemini]]'' by [[Albert Innaurato]], staged at The Little Theatre (now known as the [[Helen Hayes Theater]]) and starring [[Danny Aiello]].

Consequently, her first project after this was the 1983 comedy ''[[The Man With Two Brains]]''. Turner co-starred in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' with [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Danny DeVito]]. Film critic [[Pauline Kael]] wrote of her performance as writer Joan Wilder, \"Turner knows how to use her dimples amusingly and how to dance like a woman who didn't know she could; her star performance is exhilarating.\"<ref>Kael, Pauline.

Pre-production for the movie was fraught with conflict, because Turner refused to commit to the \"terrible\" script she had been delivered. When she said no, [[20th Century Fox]] threatened her with a $25 million [[breach of contract]] lawsuit. Eventually Douglas, also the film's producer, agreed to undertake rewrites on the script to make it more acceptable to Turner, which led to much back-and-forth between the two as the script was retooled right up to when shooting started in [[Fez, Morocco]].<ref name=\"David Marchese\">{{cite article| url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/kathleen-turner-in-conversation.html| title=In Conversation: Kathleen Turner| first=David| last=Marchese| work=Vulture.com| date=2018-08-07| access-date=2018-08-09}}</ref>\n\nSeveral months before ''Jewel'', Turner starred in ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'' with [[Jack Nicholson]], winning a second [[Golden Globe]] award, and later starred in ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', which co-starred [[Nicolas Cage]].

She also blamed her age, stating, \"when I was 40, the roles started slowing down, I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers.\"\n\nIn 1992, during the filming of'' [[Serial Mom]]'', she began experiencing \"inexplicable pains and fevers.\" {{sfn | Turner| Feldt | 2008 | p= 160}}  The arthritis diagnosis was made about a year later. By the time she was diagnosed, she \"could hardly turn her head or walk, and was told she would end up in a wheelchair\".<ref name=\"monster\" /> Of this period, she has said: \"My body could respond only with excruciating pain whenever I tried to move at all. The joints in my hands were so swollen, I couldn\u2019t hold a pen. Some days I couldn\u2019t hold a glass to get a drink of water. I couldn\u2019t pick up my child... my feet would blow up so badly that I couldn\u2019t get them into any kind of shoes, let alone walk on them.\" {{sfn | Turner| Feldt | 2008 | p= 164}}\n\nTurner's appearance changed after the arthritis diagnosis. \"The press were merciless,\" she states in her memoir. \"They snipped that I had become fat and unrecognizable because I was an angry, washed-up diva, an out-of-control has-been, when in truth the changes in my  physical appearance were caused by drugs and chemotherapy and were not within my control. Still, I did not reveal what was happening to me.\" {{sfn | Turner| Feldt | 2008 | p= 176}}\n\nAs her arthritis progressed, alcohol consumption became a problem. \"I drank consciously at first to kill the pain....Later, after I got the new medicines and the pain began to subside, I kept drinking too much... It didn't damage my work, but it damaged me personally.\"{{sfn | Turner| Feldt | 2008 | p= 180}}\n\nTurner has admitted that the drinking made her difficult to be around.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 14, 2008 |title=The View (talk show, interview with Kathleen Turner) |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/theview/index |accessdate=February 14, 2008 |publisher=ABC Television |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213122908/http://abc.go.com/daytime/theview/index |archivedate=February 13, 2008 |df= }}</ref> In 2005, an article in ''The New York Times'' stated: \"Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much.\" In her memoir, she said: \"I went on letting others believe anything they wanted to about my behavior and physical changes. Many people bought the assumption that I'd turned into a heavy drinker. I couldn't publicly refute them because I believed it was worse to have people know that I had this terrible illness. They'd hire me if they thought I was a drunk, because they could understand drinking, but they wouldn't hire me if I had a mysterious, scary illness they didn't understand.  We - Jay, my agent, myself - felt it was imperative to keep my rheumatoid arthritis quiet.\" {{ sfn | Turner| Feldt|2008| p= 180|}}\n\nHer career as a leading lady went into a steep decline and she was seen in fewer and fewer very successful films. She turned down lead roles in ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' and ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'', both of which became big hits. She appeared in the low-budget ''[[House of Cards (1993 film)|House of Cards]]'',  and had supporting roles in ''[[A Simple Wish]]'', ''[[The Real Blonde]]'', and [[Sofia Coppola]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]''.

She appeared in a small role in 2008's ''[[Marley & Me (film)|Marley & Me]]'' and also played a [[Attorney at law (United States)|defense attorney]] on ''[[Law & Order]]''.\n\nIn 2009, she played the role of Charlie Runkle's sexually hyperactive boss in season three of the television series ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''.\n\n===Voice actress===\nIn the same year as her ''Nip/Tuck'' cameo role, 2006, Turner provided the voice of Constance in the animated film ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]''. After, she provided [[radio commercial]] [[voice-over]]s for [[Lay's]] [[potato chip]]s. [[BBC Radio 4]] produced three radio dramas based on the [[V. I. Warshawski]] novels by [[Sara Paretsky]]. The first two, ''Deadlock'' and ''Killing Orders'', featured Turner reprising her 1991 movie role, which had been based on Paretsky's novel ''[[Deadlock (novel)|Deadlock]]''; however, the third, ''Bitter Medicine'', had [[Sharon Gless]] take over the part. Turner also provided the voice of [[Jessica Rabbit]] in the 1988 live action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and again in the [[Disneyland]] attraction spinoff, ''[[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]]''.\n\n===Stage career===\nAfter 1990s roles in Broadway productions of ''Indiscretions'' and ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' (for which she earned a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Actress), Turner moved to London in 2000 to star in a stage version of ''[[The Graduate]]''. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] reported that initially mediocre ticket sales for ''The Graduate'' \"went through the roof when it was announced that Turner, then aged 45, would appear naked on stage\". While her performance as the infamous Mrs. Robinson was popular with audiences, with sustained high box office for the duration of Turner's run, she received mixed reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1768900.stm |date=January 18, 2002 |title=The Graduate's London term ends |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=January 22, 2007}}</ref> The play transferred to Broadway in 2002 to similar critical reaction.\n\nIn 2005, Turner beat a score of other contenders (including [[Jessica Lange]], [[Frances McDormand]], and [[Bette Midler]])<ref name=\"monster\" /> for the role of Martha in a 2005 Broadway revival of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' at the [[Longacre Theatre]]. Albee later explained to the ''New York Times'' that when Turner read for the part with her eventual co-star [[Bill Irwin]], he heard \"an echo of the 'revelation' that he had felt years ago when the parts were read by [[Uta Hagen|[Uta] Hagen]] and [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]].\" He added that Turner had \"a look of voluptuousness, a woman of appetites, yes ... but a look of having suffered, as well.\"<ref name=\"monster\" />\n\n[[Ben Brantley]] praised Turner at length, writing:\n\n{{quote|As the man-eating Martha, Ms. Turner, a movie star whose previous theater work has been variable, finally secures her berth as a first-rate, depth-probing stage actress ... [A]t 50, this actress can look ravishing and ravaged, by turns. In the second act, she is as predatorily sexy as she was in the movie ''Body Heat''. But in the third and last act, she looks old, bereft, stripped of all erotic flourish. I didn't think I would ever be able to see ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?|Virginia Woolf]]'' again without thinking of Ms. Hagen [Uta Hagen]. But watching Ms. Turner in that last act, fully clothed but more naked than she ever was in ''[[The Graduate]]'', I didn't see the specter of Ms. Hagen. All I saw was Ms. Turner. No, let's be fair.

She admitted that she had developed into \"not a very kind person\", and actress [[Eileen Atkins]] referred to her as \"an amazing nightmare\".<ref name=\"monster\"/> In 2018, she commented on her reputation, stating: \"The 'difficult' thing was pure gender crap.

There she goes.'\"<ref name=\"David Marchese\" />\n\nTurner has defended herself against Atkins' claims, saying that Atkins harbored animosity towards her because she was having trouble memorizing her lines, which Atkins found very unprofessional. Turner later realized that the new medication for her arthritis she was taking was making her \"fuzzy\". She added that on days where the arthritis in her wrist was especially bad and she warned the other cast members not to touch it, Atkins would intentionally sit on it during a scene where Turner had to play dead, causing Turner extreme pain.<ref name=\"David Marchese\"/> Turner slammed Hollywood over the difference in the quality of roles offered to male actors and female actors as they age, calling the disparity a \"terrible double standard\".\n\nA few weeks after leaving the production of the play ''[[The Graduate]]'' in November 2002, she was admitted into the Geisinger Marworth Treatment Center in [[Waverly, PA|Waverly, Pennsylvania]], for the treatment of [[alcoholism]]. \"I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working\", she explained. \"It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking ...

stage actress and director. Known for her distinctive gritty voice, Turner has won two [[Golden Globe Awards]] and has been nominated for an [[Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kathleenturner.net/press |title=News &amp; Notable Press - Kathleen Turner |last=Turner |first=Kathleen |last2=Morrow |first2=Dustin |date=2008 |website=KathleenTurner.Net |publisher=Kathleen Turner - Official Website |access-date=Jun 30, 2019 |quote=Turner, the husky-voiced screen star known for iconic roles in Body Heat and Romancing the Stone, weighs in on her 40-year career in question-and-answer format, led by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker and author Morrow (digital film production, Portland State Univ.).}}</ref>\n\nTurner rose to fame during the 1980s, after roles in ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981), ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' (1983), ''[[Crimes of Passion (1984 film)|Crimes of Passion]]'' (1984), ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' (1984), and ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'' (1985), the last two earning her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. In the later 1980s and early 1990s, Turner had roles in ''[[The Accidental Tourist (film)|The Accidental Tourist]]'' (1988), ''[[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' (1989), ''[[Serial Mom]]'' (1994), and ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' (1986), for which she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].\n\nTurner later had roles in ''[[Undercover Blues]]'' (1993), ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)]]'' (1999), ''[[Baby Geniuses]]'' (1999), and ''[[Beautiful (2000 film)|Beautiful]]'' (2000), as well as guest-starring on the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' as [[Chandler Bing]]'s [[drag queen]] father [[Charles Bing]], and in the [[List of Californication episodes#Season 3 (2009)|third season]] of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'' as Sue Collini, the jaded, sex-crazed owner of a talent agency. Turner's voice roles include [[Jessica Rabbit]] in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' (2006), and the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]]''.\n\nIn addition to film, Turner has worked in the theatre, and has been nominated for the [[Tony Award]] twice for her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] roles as Maggie in ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' and as Martha in ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' Turner has also taught acting classes at [[New York University]].<ref name=\"sackler\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9rDBQoAQ1Y|work=Brooklyn Museum|title=Elizabeth A.

She made her film debut in 1981 as the ruthless Matty Walker in the [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Body Heat]]''; the role brought her to international prominence.

It doesn't frustrate me that nearly four decades after that film I'm still referred to as a sexual icon.

When the two met, Turner reportedly introduced herself by saying, \"Hi, I'm the young you.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=4594 | title = Young Kathleen Turner | publisher = Anecdotage.com: Famous People.

That production marked her [[off-Broadway]] debut. Several months later, Turner made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut as Judith Hastings in ''[[Gemini (play)|Gemini]]'' by [[Albert Innaurato]], staged at The Little Theatre (now known as the [[Helen Hayes Theater]]) and starring [[Danny Aiello]]. It opened May 21, 1977, during the time when she was appearing in the soap ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]''.<ref>\"Who's Who in the Cast\", Playbill for ''Gemini'', 1978.</ref>\n\n===Stardom during the 1980s===\nAfter ''Body Heat'', Turner steered away from ''femme fatale'' roles to \"prevent typecasting\" and \"because ''femme fatale'' roles had a shelf-life\". Consequently, her first project after this was the 1983 comedy ''[[The Man With Two Brains]]''. Turner co-starred in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' with [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Danny DeVito]]. Film critic [[Pauline Kael]] wrote of her performance as writer Joan Wilder, \"Turner knows how to use her dimples amusingly and how to dance like a woman who didn't know she could; her star performance is exhilarating.\"<ref>Kael, Pauline. ''5001 Nights at the Movies.'' New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1982, 1984, 1991.  p. 638.</ref> ''Romancing the Stone'' was a surprise hit: she won a [[Golden Globe]] for her role in the film, and it became one of the top-ten-grossing movies of 1984.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1984&p=.htm | title = 1984 domestic grosses | publisher = Box Office Mojo | accessdate = January 22, 2007}}</ref> Turner teamed with Douglas and DeVito again the following year for its sequel, ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''. Pre-production for the movie was fraught with conflict, because Turner refused to commit to the \"terrible\" script she had been delivered. When she said no, [[20th Century Fox]] threatened her with a $25 million [[breach of contract]] lawsuit. Eventually Douglas, also the film's producer, agreed to undertake rewrites on the script to make it more acceptable to Turner, which led to much back-and-forth between the two as the script was retooled right up to when shooting started in [[Fez, Morocco]].<ref name=\"David Marchese\">{{cite article| url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/kathleen-turner-in-conversation.html| title=In Conversation: Kathleen Turner| first=David| last=Marchese| work=Vulture.com| date=2018-08-07| access-date=2018-08-09}}</ref>\n\nSeveral months before ''Jewel'', Turner starred in ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'' with [[Jack Nicholson]], winning a second [[Golden Globe]] award, and later starred in ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', which co-starred [[Nicolas Cage]]. For ''Peggy Sue'', she received the award for [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] from the U.S. [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1986/ |title=1986 Award Winners |author= |date=2016 |publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] |work= |accessdate=October 31, 2016 }}</ref> as well as an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Actress.\n\nIn 1988's [[Cartoon Noir|toon-noir]] ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', she was the speaking voice of cartoon ''[[femme fatale]]'' [[Jessica Rabbit]], intoning the famous line, \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.\" Her uncredited, sultry performance was acclaimed as \"the kind of sexpot ball-breaker she was made for\".<ref>\"Kathleen Turner\", Thomson, David.

That same year, Turner also appeared in ''[[Switching Channels]]'', which was a loose remake of the 1940 hit film ''[[His Girl Friday]]''; this, in turn, was a loose remake of the [[Ben Hecht]]-[[Charles MacArthur]] comedy ''[[The Front Page]]''.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/04/movies/film-turner-in-switching-channels.html|title=Film: Turner in ''Switching Channels''|first=Vincent|last=Canby|authorlink=Vincent Canby|date=March 4, 1988}}</ref>\n\nTurner appeared in the 1986 song [[Emotional (Falco album)|\"The Kiss of Kathleen Turner\"]] by Austrian techno-pop singer [[Falco (musician)|Falco]]. In 1989, Turner teamed with Douglas and DeVito for a third time, in ''[[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'', but this time as Douglas's disillusioned wife, with DeVito in the role of a divorce attorney who told their shared story. ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the trio, saying that \"Mr. Douglas and Ms. Turner have never been more comfortable a team ... each of them is at his or her comic best when being as awful as both are required to be here ...

By the time she was diagnosed, she \"could hardly turn her head or walk, and was told she would end up in a wheelchair\".<ref name=\"monster\" /> Of this period, she has said: \"My body could respond only with excruciating pain whenever I tried to move at all. The joints in my hands were so swollen, I couldn\u2019t hold a pen. Some days I couldn\u2019t hold a glass to get a drink of water. I couldn\u2019t pick up my child... my feet would blow up so badly that I couldn\u2019t get them into any kind of shoes, let alone walk on them.\" {{sfn | Turner| Feldt | 2008 | p= 164}}\n\nTurner's appearance changed after the arthritis diagnosis. \"The press were merciless,\" she states in her memoir. \"They snipped that I had become fat and unrecognizable because I was an angry, washed-up diva, an out-of-control has-been, when in truth the changes in my  physical appearance were caused by drugs and chemotherapy and were not within my control. Still, I did not reveal what was happening to me.\" {{sfn | Turner| Feldt | 2008 | p= 176}}\n\nAs her arthritis progressed, alcohol consumption became a problem. \"I drank consciously at first to kill the pain....Later, after I got the new medicines and the pain began to subside, I kept drinking too much... It didn't damage my work, but it damaged me personally.\"{{sfn | Turner| Feldt | 2008 | p= 180}}\n\nTurner has admitted that the drinking made her difficult to be around.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 14, 2008 |title=The View (talk show, interview with Kathleen Turner) |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/theview/index |accessdate=February 14, 2008 |publisher=ABC Television |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213122908/http://abc.go.com/daytime/theview/index |archivedate=February 13, 2008 |df= }}</ref> In 2005, an article in ''The New York Times'' stated: \"Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much.\" In her memoir, she said: \"I went on letting others believe anything they wanted to about my behavior and physical changes. Many people bought the assumption that I'd turned into a heavy drinker. I couldn't publicly refute them because I believed it was worse to have people know that I had this terrible illness. They'd hire me if they thought I was a drunk, because they could understand drinking, but they wouldn't hire me if I had a mysterious, scary illness they didn't understand.  We - Jay, my agent, myself - felt it was imperative to keep my rheumatoid arthritis quiet.\" {{ sfn | Turner| Feldt|2008| p= 180|}}\n\nHer career as a leading lady went into a steep decline and she was seen in fewer and fewer very successful films. She turned down lead roles in ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' and ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'', both of which became big hits. She appeared in the low-budget ''[[House of Cards (1993 film)|House of Cards]]'',  and had supporting roles in ''[[A Simple Wish]]'', ''[[The Real Blonde]]'', and [[Sofia Coppola]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]''. She also provided the voice of Malibu Stacy's creator, Stacy Lovell, in the episode \"[[Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy]]\" on ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 14, 2008 |title=Simpsons Full Cast and Crew |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/fullcredits }}</ref>\n\n===2000s \u2013 remission===\nDespite drug therapy to help her condition, the disease progressed for about eight years. Then, thanks to newly available treatments, her arthritis went into [[remission (medicine)|remission]]. She was seen increasingly on television, including three episodes of ''[[Friends]]'', where she appeared as [[Chandler Bing]]'s estranged, [[gay]] father, who works as a [[Drag Queen|drag queen]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite web |date=February 14, 2008 |title=Kathleen Turner: Charles Bing, Helena Handbasket |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/characters/nm0000678?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t54 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Turner guest-starred on FX's ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'', playing a [[phone sex]] operator in need of laryngeal surgery. She appeared in a small role in 2008's ''[[Marley & Me (film)|Marley & Me]]'' and also played a [[Attorney at law (United States)|defense attorney]] on ''[[Law & Order]]''.\n\nIn 2009, she played the role of Charlie Runkle's sexually hyperactive boss in season three of the television series ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''.\n\n===Voice actress===\nIn the same year as her ''Nip/Tuck'' cameo role, 2006, Turner provided the voice of Constance in the animated film ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]''. After, she provided [[radio commercial]] [[voice-over]]s for [[Lay's]] [[potato chip]]s. [[BBC Radio 4]] produced three radio dramas based on the [[V. I. Warshawski]] novels by [[Sara Paretsky]]. The first two, ''Deadlock'' and ''Killing Orders'', featured Turner reprising her 1991 movie role, which had been based on Paretsky's novel ''[[Deadlock (novel)|Deadlock]]''; however, the third, ''Bitter Medicine'', had [[Sharon Gless]] take over the part. Turner also provided the voice of [[Jessica Rabbit]] in the 1988 live action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and again in the [[Disneyland]] attraction spinoff, ''[[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]]''.\n\n===Stage career===\nAfter 1990s roles in Broadway productions of ''Indiscretions'' and ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' (for which she earned a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Actress), Turner moved to London in 2000 to star in a stage version of ''[[The Graduate]]''. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] reported that initially mediocre ticket sales for ''The Graduate'' \"went through the roof when it was announced that Turner, then aged 45, would appear naked on stage\". While her performance as the infamous Mrs. Robinson was popular with audiences, with sustained high box office for the duration of Turner's run, she received mixed reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1768900.stm |date=January 18, 2002 |title=The Graduate's London term ends |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=January 22, 2007}}</ref> The play transferred to Broadway in 2002 to similar critical reaction.\n\nIn 2005, Turner beat a score of other contenders (including [[Jessica Lange]], [[Frances McDormand]], and [[Bette Midler]])<ref name=\"monster\" /> for the role of Martha in a 2005 Broadway revival of [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' at the [[Longacre Theatre]]. Albee later explained to the ''New York Times'' that when Turner read for the part with her eventual co-star [[Bill Irwin]], he heard \"an echo of the 'revelation' that he had felt years ago when the parts were read by [[Uta Hagen|[Uta] Hagen]] and [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]].\" He added that Turner had \"a look of voluptuousness, a woman of appetites, yes ... but a look of having suffered, as well.\"<ref name=\"monster\" />\n\n[[Ben Brantley]] praised Turner at length, writing:\n\n{{quote|As the man-eating Martha, Ms. Turner, a movie star whose previous theater work has been variable, finally secures her berth as a first-rate, depth-probing stage actress ... [A]t 50, this actress can look ravishing and ravaged, by turns. In the second act, she is as predatorily sexy as she was in the movie ''Body Heat''. But in the third and last act, she looks old, bereft, stripped of all erotic flourish. I didn't think I would ever be able to see ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?|Virginia Woolf]]'' again without thinking of Ms. Hagen [Uta Hagen]. But watching Ms. Turner in that last act, fully clothed but more naked than she ever was in ''[[The Graduate]]'', I didn't see the specter of Ms. Hagen. All I saw was Ms. Turner. No, let's be fair.

She admitted that she had developed into \"not a very kind person\", and actress [[Eileen Atkins]] referred to her as \"an amazing nightmare\".<ref name=\"monster\"/> In 2018, she commented on her reputation, stating: \"The 'difficult' thing was pure gender crap.

There she goes.'\"<ref name=\"David Marchese\" />\n\nTurner has defended herself against Atkins' claims, saying that Atkins harbored animosity towards her because she was having trouble memorizing her lines, which Atkins found very unprofessional. Turner later realized that the new medication for her arthritis she was taking was making her \"fuzzy\". She added that on days where the arthritis in her wrist was especially bad and she warned the other cast members not to touch it, Atkins would intentionally sit on it during a scene where Turner had to play dead, causing Turner extreme pain.<ref name=\"David Marchese\"/> Turner slammed Hollywood over the difference in the quality of roles offered to male actors and female actors as they age, calling the disparity a \"terrible double standard\".\n\nA few weeks after leaving the production of the play ''[[The Graduate]]'' in November 2002, she was admitted into the Geisinger Marworth Treatment Center in [[Waverly, PA|Waverly, Pennsylvania]], for the treatment of [[alcoholism]]. \"I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working\", she explained. \"It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking ...

Her younger sister was [[Jadwiga of Greater Poland]].\n\n== Marriage ==\nIn 1273, Elisabeth married [[Henry V, Duke of Legnica]] (1248\u20131296), who was the son of [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bald]] and Hedwig of Anhalt.\n\nThe couple had eight children:\n\n#Hedwig (b. ca. 1277 \u2013 d. aft. 3 February 1347), married by 1289/95 to Prince Otto of [[Brandenburg]]-Salzwedel, second son of Margrave [[Otto V, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel|Otto V]]. After her husband died, she became a nun in St. Klara, Wroc\u0142aw.\n#Euphemia (b. ca. 1278 \u2013 d. June 1347), married in 1300 to Otto II of G\u00f6rz, Duke of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. Their daughter was [[Elisabeth of Carinthia]], through her Elisabeth and Henry were direct ancestors of the [[Kings of Sicily]], [[Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].\n#Anna (b. 1284 \u2013 d. 2/3 October 1343), Abbess of St. Klara, Wroc\u0142aw.\n#Elisabeth (b. ca. 1290 \u2013 d.

Henry was ill by the time of his release; this was due to the conditions of his confinement (he was locked in an iron cage).\n\nHe never recovered his health, and seems to have known that he was not going to live much longer. Fearing for the future of his Duchy, in 1294 he decided to put himself under the protection of the [[Holy See]].\n\nHenry died on 22 February 1296 and was buried in the [[Clare of Assisi|Clare]] monastery of Wroc\u0142aw. At this time, all his sons were minors, and because of this, they were put under the tutelage of his brother [[Bolko I the Strict|Bolko]].\n\n== Later life ==\nElisabeth's mother and younger sister, Anna had gone to live in a nunnery after the death of their father. Jadwiga was married to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]; they had many children \u2013 among them were [[Elisabeth of Poland (1305\u20131380)|Elizabeth of Poland]] and [[Casimir III the Great]].\n\nElisabeth and her children went to live with [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]] and his family. Here, Wenceslaus and Elisabeth arranged for her son [[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous|Boles\u0142aw]] to marry Wenceslaus' youngest daughter [[Margaret of Bohemia (1296\u20131322)|Margaret]].\n\nFollowing Boles\u0142aw's arrival in the Bohemian court and after his betrothal to Margaret, the King clearly favored him; this attitude caused fear among the closest male relatives of the King, who saw the young Duke of Legnica as a potential rival for the throne. Although the fact that Wenceslaus II had a son made him seem irrelevant, the sudden death of the King in 1305 and one year later the murder of his son and successor [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]] in [[Olomouc]] gained him an unexpected importance. Boles\u0142aw began his fight for the Bohemian throne taking the title of \"''haeres Regni Poloniae''\" (heir of the Polish Kingdom).\n\nBoles\u0142aw and Margaret were married in 1308 and had three children. By this time, Elisabeth had died. She died on 28 September 1304 and was buried alongside her husband in the [[Clare of Assisi|Clare]] monastery of [[Wroc\u0142aw]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{Ahnentafel\n|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #999;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #bbb;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ddd;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #eee;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #fff;\n|1= '''Elisabeth of Kalisz'''\n|2= [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]]\n|3= [[Jolenta of Poland]]\n|4= [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic]]\n|5= [[Jadwiga (wife of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic)|Jadwiga]]\n|6= [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]\n|7= [[Maria Laskarina]]\n|8= [[Odon of Pozna\u0144]]\n|9= Viacheslava Yaroslavna of Halych  \n|10=\n|11=\n|12=[[Andrew II of Hungary]] \n|13=[[Gertrude of Merania]]\n|14=[[Theodore I Laskaris]]\n|15=[[Anna Komnena Angelina]]\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Piast dynasty]]\n*[[Jadwiga of Greater Poland]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/POLAND.htm#BoleslawPoboznydied1279 Her listing along with her father's and sister's in \"Medieval lands\" by Charles Cawley.

Nov 1357/58), Abbess of St. Klara, Wroc\u0142aw.\n#[[Boleslaw III the Generous|Boleslaw III the Wasteful]] (b. 23 September 1291 \u2013 d. 21 April 1352).\n#Helena (b. ca. 1293 \u2013 d. aft. 1300), nun in St. Klara, Gniezno.\n#[[Henry VI the Good]] (b. 18 March 1294 \u2013 d. 24 November 1335).\n#[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Legnica|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] (b. posthumously, 6 June 1296 \u2013 d. 13 January aft. 1352).\n\nHer husband went to war with [[Henry III, Duke of Silesia-Glogau]]; he was captured and imprisoned in [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]] until he was released. Henry was ill by the time of his release; this was due to the conditions of his confinement (he was locked in an iron cage).\n\nHe never recovered his health, and seems to have known that he was not going to live much longer. Fearing for the future of his Duchy, in 1294 he decided to put himself under the protection of the [[Holy See]].\n\nHenry died on 22 February 1296 and was buried in the [[Clare of Assisi|Clare]] monastery of Wroc\u0142aw. At this time, all his sons were minors, and because of this, they were put under the tutelage of his brother [[Bolko I the Strict|Bolko]].\n\n== Later life ==\nElisabeth's mother and younger sister, Anna had gone to live in a nunnery after the death of their father. Jadwiga was married to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]; they had many children \u2013 among them were [[Elisabeth of Poland (1305\u20131380)|Elizabeth of Poland]] and [[Casimir III the Great]].\n\nElisabeth and her children went to live with [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]] and his family. Here, Wenceslaus and Elisabeth arranged for her son [[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous|Boles\u0142aw]] to marry Wenceslaus' youngest daughter [[Margaret of Bohemia (1296\u20131322)|Margaret]].\n\nFollowing Boles\u0142aw's arrival in the Bohemian court and after his betrothal to Margaret, the King clearly favored him; this attitude caused fear among the closest male relatives of the King, who saw the young Duke of Legnica as a potential rival for the throne. Although the fact that Wenceslaus II had a son made him seem irrelevant, the sudden death of the King in 1305 and one year later the murder of his son and successor [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]] in [[Olomouc]] gained him an unexpected importance. Boles\u0142aw began his fight for the Bohemian throne taking the title of \"''haeres Regni Poloniae''\" (heir of the Polish Kingdom).\n\nBoles\u0142aw and Margaret were married in 1308 and had three children. By this time, Elisabeth had died. She died on 28 September 1304 and was buried alongside her husband in the [[Clare of Assisi|Clare]] monastery of [[Wroc\u0142aw]].\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{Ahnentafel\n|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #999;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #bbb;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ddd;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #eee;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #fff;\n|1= '''Elisabeth of Kalisz'''\n|2= [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]]\n|3= [[Jolenta of Poland]]\n|4= [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic]]\n|5= [[Jadwiga (wife of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic)|Jadwiga]]\n|6= [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]\n|7= [[Maria Laskarina]]\n|8= [[Odon of Pozna\u0144]]\n|9= Viacheslava Yaroslavna of Halych  \n|10=\n|11=\n|12=[[Andrew II of Hungary]] \n|13=[[Gertrude of Merania]]\n|14=[[Theodore I Laskaris]]\n|15=[[Anna Komnena Angelina]]\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Piast dynasty]]\n*[[Jadwiga of Greater Poland]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/POLAND.htm#BoleslawPoboznydied1279 Her listing along with her father's and sister's in \"Medieval lands\" by Charles Cawley.

In 1075, he captured the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] cities of Nicaea ([[\u0130znik]]) and Nicomedia ([[\u0130zmit]]). Two years later, he declared himself sultan of an independent Seljuq state and established his capital at \u0130znik.<ref>Sicker, Martin, ''The Islamic world in ascendancy: from the Arab conquests to the siege of Vienna '', (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000), 63-64.</ref>\n\nSuleiman was killed in [[Antioch]] in 1086 by [[Tutush I]], the Seljuk ruler of [[Syria]], and Suleiman's son [[Kilij Arslan I]] was imprisoned. When Malik Shah died in 1092, Kilij Arslan was released and immediately established himself in his father's territories.\n\n===Crusades===\n[[File:Seljuk Sultanate of Rum 1190 Locator Map.svg|thumb|250px|Seljuk Sultanate of Rum in 1190.]]\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\nKilij Arslan, although victorious in the People's Crusade of 1096, was defeated by soldiers of the [[First Crusade]] and driven back into south-central Anatolia, where he set up his state with capital in [[Konya]]. He defeated three Crusade contingents in the 1101 Crusade. In 1107, he ventured east and captured [[Mosul]] but died the same year fighting Malik Shah's son, [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Mehmed Tapar]]. He was the first Muslim commander against the crusades.\n\nMeanwhile, another Rum Seljuq, [[Malik Shah (R\u00fbm)|Malik Shah]] (not to be confused with the Seljuq sultan of the same name), captured Konya. In 1116 Kilij Arslan's son, [[Mesud I]], took the city with the help of the [[Danishmends]].\n\nUpon Mesud's death in 1156, the sultanate controlled nearly all of central Anatolia. Mesud's son, [[Kilij Arslan II]], captured the remaining territories around [[Sivas]] and [[Malatya]] from the last of the Danishmends. At the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]] in 1176, Kilij Arslan II also defeated a Byzantine army led by [[Manuel I Komnenos]], dealing a major blow to Byzantine power in the region. Despite a temporary occupation of Konya in 1190 by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s forces of the [[Third Crusade]], the sultanate was quick to recover and consolidate its power.<ref name=\"Turan244-245\">''Anatolia in the period of the Seljuks and the \"beyliks\"'', Osman Turan, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', Vol. 1A, ed.

Kaykhusraw's most important achievement was the capture of the harbour of [[Antalya|Attalia]] (Antalya) on the Mediterranean coast in 1207. His son Kaykaus captured [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]] and made the [[Empire of Trebizond]] his vassal in 1214. He also subjugated [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] but in 1218 was forced to surrender the city of [[Aleppo]], acquired from [[al-Kamil]]. Kayqubad continued to acquire lands along the Mediterranean coast from 1221 to 1225.\n\nIn the 1220s, he sent an expeditionary force across the [[Black Sea]] to [[Crimea]].<ref>A.C.S.

After three years, when he had finally quelled the revolt, the Crimean foothold was lost and the state and the sultanate's army had weakened. It is in these conditions that he had to face a far more dangerous threat, that of the expanding [[Mongols]]. The forces of the [[Mongol Empire]] took [[Erzurum]] in 1242 and in 1243, the sultan was crushed by [[Baiju]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] (a mountain between the cities of Sivas and [[Erzincan]]), and the Seljuq Turks were forced to swear allegiance to the Mongols and became their vassals.<ref name=\"John Joseph Saunders 1971\">John Joseph Saunders, ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 79.</ref> The sultan himself had fled to Antalya after the 1243 battle, where he died in 1246, his death starting a period of tripartite, and then dual, rule that lasted until 1260.\n\nThe Seljuq realm was divided among Kaykhusraw's three sons. The eldest, [[Kaykaus II]] (1246\u20131260), assumed the rule in the area west of the river [[K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River|K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak]]. His younger brothers, [[Kilij Arslan IV]] (1248\u20131265) and [[Kayqubad II]] (1249\u20131257), were set to rule the regions east of the river under Mongol administration. In October 1256, Bayju defeated Kaykaus II near [[Aksaray]] and all of Anatolia became officially subject to [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. In 1260 Kaykaus II fled from Konya to Crimea where he died in 1279. Kilij Arslan IV was executed in 1265, and [[Kaykhusraw III]] (1265\u20131284) became the nominal ruler of all of Anatolia, with the tangible power exercised either by the Mongols or the sultan's influential regents.\n[[File:Anatolian Beyliks in 1300.png|thumb|The declining Sultanate of R\u00fbm, vassal of the [[Ilkhanate|Mongols]], and the emerging beyliks, c.&nbsp;1300]]\n\n===Disintegration===\nThe Seljuq state had started to split into small [[emirate]]s ([[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]]) that increasingly distanced themselves from both Mongol and Seljuq control. In 1277, responding to a call from Anatolia, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultan]], [[Baibars]], raided Anatolia and defeated the Mongols, temporarily replacing them as the administrator of the Seljuq realm. But since the native forces who had called him to Anatolia did not manifest themselves for the defense of the land, he had to return to his home base in [[Egypt]], and the Mongol administration was re-assumed, officially and severely. Also, the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] captured the Mediterranean coast from [[Gazipa\u015fa|Selinos]] to [[Silifke|Seleucia]], as well as the cities of [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Marash]] and [[Besni|Behisni]], from the Seljuq in the 1240s.\n\n[[File:Hanabad Caravanserai Cardak.jpg|thumb|Hanabad [[caravanserai]] in [[\u00c7ardak]] (1230)]]\n\nNear the end of his reign, Kaykhusraw III could claim direct sovereignty only over lands around Konya. Some of the beyliks (including the early Ottoman state) and Seljuq governors of Anatolia continued to recognize, albeit nominally, the supremacy of the sultan in Konya, delivering the [[khutbah]] in the name of the sultans in Konya in recognition of their sovereignty, and the sultans continued to call themselves Fahreddin, ''the Pride of Islam''. When Kaykhusraw III was executed in 1284, the Seljuq dynasty suffered another blow from internal struggles which lasted until 1303 when the son of Kaykaus II, [[Mesud II]], established himself as sultan in Kayseri. He was murdered in 1308 and his son Mesud III soon afterwards. A distant relative to the Seljuq dynasty momentarily installed himself as emir of Konya, but he was defeated and his lands conquered by the [[Karamanids]] in 1328. The sultanate's monetary sphere of influence lasted slightly longer and coins of Seljuq mint, generally considered to be of reliable value, continued to be used throughout the 14th century, once again, including by the Ottomans.\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{Further|Seljuk architecture|Al\u00e2eddin Mosque|Ince Minaret Medrese|Karatay Madrasa, Konya}}\nThe Seljuk dynasty of Rum, as successors to the Great Seljuqs, based their political, religious and cultural heritage on the [[Islam-i Ajam|Perso-Islamic tradition]],<ref>''Saljuqs: Saljuqs of Anatolia'', Robert Hillenbrand, ''The Dictionary of Art'', Vol.27, Ed.

There are two caravanserais that carry the name \"Sultan Han\", the other one being between Kayseri and Sivas. Furthermore, apart from Sultanhan\u0131, five other towns across Turkey owe their names to caravanserais built there. These are Alacahan in [[Kangal]], [[Dura\u011fan]], [[Hekimhan]] and [[Kad\u0131nhan\u0131]], as well as the township of Akhan within the [[Denizli]] metropolitan area. The caravanserai of Hekimhan is unique in having, underneath the usual inscription in [[Arabic]] with information relating to the edifice, two further inscriptions in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], since it was constructed by the sultan [[Kayqubad I]]'s doctor (''hekim'') who is thought to have been a [[Christians|Christian]] by his origins, and to have [[religious conversion|convert]]ed to [[Islam]].

All but the caravanserai, which remains undiscovered, was explored in the 1960s by the art historian  [[Oktay Aslanapa]], and the finds as well as a number of documents attest to the existence of a vivid settlement in the site, such as a 1463 Ottoman [[firman]] which instructs the headmaster of the madrasa to lodge not in the school but in the caravanserai.\n\n[[File:Gok_Medresesi1.jpg|thumb|[[G\u00f6k Medrese (Sivas)|G\u00f6k Medrese]] (Celestial [[Madrasa]]) of [[Sivas]], periodic capital of the Sultanate of Rum]]\n\nThe Seljuk palaces, as well as their armies, were staffed with [[ghulam]]s (plural ''ghilm\u00e2n'', {{lang-ar|\u063a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646}}), enslaved youths taken from non-Muslim communities, mainly Greeks from former Byzantine territories.

It reached the height of its power during the late 12th and early 13th century, when it succeeded in taking Byzantine key ports on the [[Antalya|Mediterranean]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Black Sea]] coasts. In the east, the sultanate absorbed other Turkish states and reached [[Lake Van]]. Trade from Iran and [[Central Asia]] across Anatolia was developed by a system of [[caravanserai]]. Especially strong trade ties with the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] formed during this period. The increased wealth allowed the sultanate to absorb other Turkish states that had been established in eastern Anatolia ([[Danishmendids]], [[House of Meng\u00fcjek]], [[Saltukids]], [[Artuqids]]).\n\nThe Seljuq sultans bore the brunt of the [[Crusades]] and eventually succumbed to the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] at the 1243 [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]].

The last of the Seljuq vassal sultans of the Ilkhanate, [[Mesud II]], was murdered in 1308. The dissolution of the Seljuq state left behind many small [[Anatolian beyliks]] (Turkish principalities), among them that of the [[Ottoman dynasty]], which eventually conquered the rest and reunited Anatolia to [[rise of the Ottoman Empire|become the Ottoman Empire]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum}}\n\n===Establishment===\nIn the 1070s, after the [[battle of Manzikert]], the Seljuk commander [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], a distant cousin of [[Malik-Shah I]] and a former contender for the throne of the [[Seljuk Empire]], came to power in western [[Anatolia]]. In 1075, he captured the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] cities of Nicaea ([[\u0130znik]]) and Nicomedia ([[\u0130zmit]]). Two years later, he declared himself sultan of an independent Seljuq state and established his capital at \u0130znik.<ref>Sicker, Martin, ''The Islamic world in ascendancy: from the Arab conquests to the siege of Vienna '', (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000), 63-64.</ref>\n\nSuleiman was killed in [[Antioch]] in 1086 by [[Tutush I]], the Seljuk ruler of [[Syria]], and Suleiman's son [[Kilij Arslan I]] was imprisoned. When Malik Shah died in 1092, Kilij Arslan was released and immediately established himself in his father's territories.\n\n===Crusades===\n[[File:Seljuk Sultanate of Rum 1190 Locator Map.svg|thumb|250px|Seljuk Sultanate of Rum in 1190.]]\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\nKilij Arslan, although victorious in the People's Crusade of 1096, was defeated by soldiers of the [[First Crusade]] and driven back into south-central Anatolia, where he set up his state with capital in [[Konya]]. He defeated three Crusade contingents in the 1101 Crusade. In 1107, he ventured east and captured [[Mosul]] but died the same year fighting Malik Shah's son, [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Mehmed Tapar]]. He was the first Muslim commander against the crusades.\n\nMeanwhile, another Rum Seljuq, [[Malik Shah (R\u00fbm)|Malik Shah]] (not to be confused with the Seljuq sultan of the same name), captured Konya. In 1116 Kilij Arslan's son, [[Mesud I]], took the city with the help of the [[Danishmends]].\n\nUpon Mesud's death in 1156, the sultanate controlled nearly all of central Anatolia. Mesud's son, [[Kilij Arslan II]], captured the remaining territories around [[Sivas]] and [[Malatya]] from the last of the Danishmends. At the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]] in 1176, Kilij Arslan II also defeated a Byzantine army led by [[Manuel I Komnenos]], dealing a major blow to Byzantine power in the region. Despite a temporary occupation of Konya in 1190 by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s forces of the [[Third Crusade]], the sultanate was quick to recover and consolidate its power.<ref name=\"Turan244-245\">''Anatolia in the period of the Seljuks and the \"beyliks\"'', Osman Turan, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', Vol. 1A, ed.

Kaykhusraw's most important achievement was the capture of the harbour of [[Antalya|Attalia]] (Antalya) on the Mediterranean coast in 1207. His son Kaykaus captured [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]] and made the [[Empire of Trebizond]] his vassal in 1214. He also subjugated [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] but in 1218 was forced to surrender the city of [[Aleppo]], acquired from [[al-Kamil]]. Kayqubad continued to acquire lands along the Mediterranean coast from 1221 to 1225.\n\nIn the 1220s, he sent an expeditionary force across the [[Black Sea]] to [[Crimea]].<ref>A.C.S.

After three years, when he had finally quelled the revolt, the Crimean foothold was lost and the state and the sultanate's army had weakened. It is in these conditions that he had to face a far more dangerous threat, that of the expanding [[Mongols]]. The forces of the [[Mongol Empire]] took [[Erzurum]] in 1242 and in 1243, the sultan was crushed by [[Baiju]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] (a mountain between the cities of Sivas and [[Erzincan]]), and the Seljuq Turks were forced to swear allegiance to the Mongols and became their vassals.<ref name=\"John Joseph Saunders 1971\"/> The sultan himself had fled to Antalya after the 1243 battle, where he died in 1246, his death starting a period of tripartite, and then dual, rule that lasted until 1260.\n\nThe Seljuq realm was divided among Kaykhusraw's three sons. The eldest, [[Kaykaus II]] (1246\u20131260), assumed the rule in the area west of the river [[K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River|K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak]]. His younger brothers, [[Kilij Arslan IV]] (1248\u20131265) and [[Kayqubad II]] (1249\u20131257), were set to rule the regions east of the river under Mongol administration. In October 1256, Bayju defeated Kaykaus II near [[Aksaray]] and all of Anatolia became officially subject to [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. In 1260 Kaykaus II fled from Konya to Crimea where he died in 1279. Kilij Arslan IV was executed in 1265, and [[Kaykhusraw III]] (1265\u20131284) became the nominal ruler of all of Anatolia, with the tangible power exercised either by the Mongols or the sultan's influential regents.\n[[File:Anatolian Beyliks in 1300.png|thumb|The declining Sultanate of R\u00fbm, vassal of the [[Ilkhanate|Mongols]], and the emerging beyliks, c.&nbsp;1300]]\n\n===Disintegration===\nThe Seljuq state had started to split into small [[emirate]]s ([[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]]) that increasingly distanced themselves from both Mongol and Seljuq control. In 1277, responding to a call from Anatolia, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultan]], [[Baibars]], raided Anatolia and defeated the Mongols, temporarily replacing them as the administrator of the Seljuq realm. But since the native forces who had called him to Anatolia did not manifest themselves for the defense of the land, he had to return to his home base in [[Egypt]], and the Mongol administration was re-assumed, officially and severely. Also, the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] captured the Mediterranean coast from [[Gazipa\u015fa|Selinos]] to [[Silifke|Seleucia]], as well as the cities of [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Marash]] and [[Besni|Behisni]], from the Seljuq in the 1240s.\n\n[[File:Hanabad Caravanserai Cardak.jpg|thumb|Hanabad [[caravanserai]] in [[\u00c7ardak]] (1230)]]\n\nNear the end of his reign, Kaykhusraw III could claim direct sovereignty only over lands around Konya. Some of the beyliks (including the early Ottoman state) and Seljuq governors of Anatolia continued to recognize, albeit nominally, the supremacy of the sultan in Konya, delivering the [[khutbah]] in the name of the sultans in Konya in recognition of their sovereignty, and the sultans continued to call themselves Fahreddin, ''the Pride of Islam''. When Kaykhusraw III was executed in 1284, the Seljuq dynasty suffered another blow from internal struggles which lasted until 1303 when the son of Kaykaus II, [[Mesud II]], established himself as sultan in Kayseri. He was murdered in 1308 and his son Mesud III soon afterwards.

There are two caravanserais that carry the name \"Sultan Han\", the other one being between Kayseri and Sivas. Furthermore, apart from Sultanhan\u0131, five other towns across Turkey owe their names to caravanserais built there. These are Alacahan in [[Kangal]], [[Dura\u011fan]], [[Hekimhan]] and [[Kad\u0131nhan\u0131]], as well as the township of Akhan within the [[Denizli]] metropolitan area. The caravanserai of Hekimhan is unique in having, underneath the usual inscription in [[Arabic]] with information relating to the edifice, two further inscriptions in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], since it was constructed by the sultan [[Kayqubad I]]'s doctor (''hekim'') who is thought to have been a [[Christians|Christian]] by his origins, and to have [[religious conversion|convert]]ed to [[Islam]]. There are other particular cases like the settlement in [[:tr:Kalehisar, \u00c7orum|Kalehisar]] (contiguous to an ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]] site) near [[Alaca]], founded by the Seljuq commander [[H\u00fcsameddin Temurlu]], who had taken refuge in the region after the defeat in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] and had founded a township comprising a castle, a madrasa, a habitation zone and a caravanserai, which were later abandoned apparently around the 16th century. All but the caravanserai, which remains undiscovered, was explored in the 1960s by the art historian  [[Oktay Aslanapa]], and the finds as well as a number of documents attest to the existence of a vivid settlement in the site, such as a 1463 Ottoman [[firman]] which instructs the headmaster of the madrasa to lodge not in the school but in the caravanserai.\n\n[[File:Gok_Medresesi1.jpg|thumb|[[G\u00f6k Medrese (Sivas)|G\u00f6k Medrese]] (Celestial [[Madrasa]]) of [[Sivas]], periodic capital of the Sultanate of Rum]]\n\nThe Seljuk palaces, as well as their armies, were staffed with [[ghulam]]s (plural ''ghilm\u00e2n'', {{lang-ar|\u063a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646}}), enslaved youths taken from non-Muslim communities, mainly Greeks from former Byzantine territories.

However, both their friendship and Dos have remained intact; they even recorded their third album, ''[[Justamente Tres]]'', not long after their [[divorce]].\n\n===Solo career===\nAfter working with Firehose, Watt began a solo career. His first album, ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]'', featured appearances from dozens of musicians (many were Watt's peers from the 1980s SST era), including [[Henry Rollins]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[J Mascis]], [[Carla Bozulich]], [[Evan Dando]], members of [[Sonic Youth]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Frank Black]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],  [[Soul Asylum]], [[Jane's Addiction]], the [[Beastie Boys]] and the [[Screaming Trees]]. The album and its supporting tour were Watt's first taste of mainstream fame, when Vedder and [[Dave Grohl]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] were part of his touring group. After Vedder returned to his [[Pearl Jam]] commitments and Grohl began working with his new band [[Foo Fighters]], Watt formed his only four-piece touring group to date, [[The Crew Of The Flying Saucer]], featuring guitarist [[Nels Cline]] and two drummers.\n\nIn 1996, Watt contributed bass lines to two songs on [[Porno for Pyros]]' second album, ''[[Good God's Urge]]''. He subsequently ended up being the bassist for the tour that followed the release of the album.\n\nHe made an appearance in an episode of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''.\n\nIn 1997, Watt released ''[[Contemplating the Engine Room]]'', a punk rock [[song cycle]] using naval life as an extended [[metaphor]] for both Watt's family history (the album has a picture of his father in his Navy uniform on the cover) and the Minutemen. The album, which was critically well received, features the trio of musicians [[Nels Cline]] on guitar, [[Stephen Hodges]] on drums, and Watt as the only singer.\n\nWatt went on to play in such groups as [[Banyan (band)|Banyan]] (with [[Stephen Perkins]] and Nels Cline) and [[Hellride]], a sometime live outfit that plays cover versions of [[The Stooges|Stooges]] songs. He also played in [[Wylde Ratttz]] with Sonic Youth's [[Thurston Moore]] and The Stooges' [[Ron Asheton]], recording a song for the film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bennett|first=James|title=Becoming a Stooge: an Interview with Mike Watt|url=https://www.slugmag.com/music-features/becoming-a-stooge-an-interview-with-mike-watt/|publisher=[[SLUG Magazine]]|date=February 28, 2007|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> Watt also recorded a bass line to send to the [[Pennsylvania]] space-folk band The Clubber Lang Gang for their record ''Now Here This'', on the track \"For the Broken People\".

At several of the shows, [[Ron Asheton]] formerly of The Stooges joined Mascis and Watt onstage, wherein the group would play entire sets of Stooges songs. Watt and Mascis later joined Asheton and his brother, Stooges drummer [[Scott Asheton]], for a one-time-only performance at a [[Belgium|Belgian]] festival under the name '''Asheton, Asheton, Mascis & Watt'''. In 2001, Watt was one of several bassists invited to participate in the sessions for [[Gov't Mule]]'s ''[[The Deep End, Volume 1|The Deep End]]'', partly on the recommendation of [[Primus (band)|Primus]]' [[Les Claypool]]. Watt and Gov't Mule recorded a cover version of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s \"Effigy\" for the album. The sessions were immortalized in the documentary feature film ''[[Rising Low]]''.\n\nIn 2002, Watt, along with [[Pete Yorn]] and members of [[The Hives]], backed [[Iggy Pop]] for a short set of Stooges songs at that year's [[Shortlist Music Prize]] ceremony, after which Watt was asked to play bass in the reunited Stooges lineup in 2003.

[[Sonic Youth]] invited Watt to hang out with them in [[New York City]] in 1986; they recorded a cover of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"Burnin' Up\" (with additional guitars by Greg Ginn) on the first [[Ciccone Youth]] [[EP (format)|EP]], and Watt played bass for two songs on the Sonic Youth album ''[[Evol (Sonic Youth album)|Evol]]''.<ref name=\"adams\">{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Owen|title=Louder Than War Exclusive Interview: Mike Watt \u2013 Stooges / Minutemen Bass Genius|url=https://louderthanwar.com/mike-watt-stoogesminutemen-bass-genius-exclusive-interview/|publisher=[[Louder Than War]]|date=June 27, 2011|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Craig|title=Bass, flannel and \u2018jamming econo\u2019 to the end: Pioneering punk rocker Mike Watt to perform in Eugene Thursday|url=https://www.dailyemerald.com/arts-culture/bass-flannel-and-jamming-econo-to-the-end-pioneering-punk/article_96e3560b-a141-52f4-b1f5-9daba169d909.html|newspaper=[[Daily Emerald]]|date=Mar 1, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref> Watt cites this period as critical in inspiring his post-Minutemen career saying, \"The first thing I did was Thurston asked me to play bass on ''Evol''.

Following three releases on [[SST Records|SST]], Firehose was signed to [[Columbia Records]] by A&R man Jim Dunbar. Shortly after the release of 1993's ''Mr. Machinery Operator'', the band decided to call it quits.\n\nWatt and Kira married in 1987, but their marriage ended not long after Firehose's break-up. However, both their friendship and Dos have remained intact; they even recorded their third album, ''[[Justamente Tres]]'', not long after their [[divorce]].\n\n===Solo career===\nAfter working with Firehose, Watt began a solo career. His first album, ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]'', featured appearances from dozens of musicians (many were Watt's peers from the 1980s SST era), including [[Henry Rollins]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[J Mascis]], [[Carla Bozulich]], [[Evan Dando]], members of [[Sonic Youth]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Frank Black]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],  [[Soul Asylum]], [[Jane's Addiction]], the [[Beastie Boys]] and the [[Screaming Trees]]. The album and its supporting tour were Watt's first taste of mainstream fame, when Vedder and [[Dave Grohl]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] were part of his touring group. After Vedder returned to his [[Pearl Jam]] commitments and Grohl began working with his new band [[Foo Fighters]], Watt formed his only four-piece touring group to date, [[The Crew Of The Flying Saucer]], featuring guitarist [[Nels Cline]] and two drummers.\n\nIn 1996, Watt contributed bass lines to two songs on [[Porno for Pyros]]' second album, ''[[Good God's Urge]]''. He subsequently ended up being the bassist for the tour that followed the release of the album.\n\nHe made an appearance in an episode of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''.\n\nIn 1997, Watt released ''[[Contemplating the Engine Room]]'', a punk rock [[song cycle]] using naval life as an extended [[metaphor]] for both Watt's family history (the album has a picture of his father in his Navy uniform on the cover) and the Minutemen. The album, which was critically well received, features the trio of musicians [[Nels Cline]] on guitar, [[Stephen Hodges]] on drums, and Watt as the only singer.\n\nWatt went on to play in such groups as [[Banyan (band)|Banyan]] (with [[Stephen Perkins]] and Nels Cline) and [[Hellride]], a sometime live outfit that plays cover versions of [[The Stooges|Stooges]] songs. He also played in [[Wylde Ratttz]] with Sonic Youth's [[Thurston Moore]] and The Stooges' [[Ron Asheton]], recording a song for the film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bennett|first=James|title=Becoming a Stooge: an Interview with Mike Watt|url=https://www.slugmag.com/music-features/becoming-a-stooge-an-interview-with-mike-watt/|publisher=[[SLUG Magazine]]|date=February 28, 2007|accessdate=March 23, 2019}}</ref> Watt also recorded a bass line to send to the [[Pennsylvania]] space-folk band The Clubber Lang Gang for their record ''Now Here This'', on the track \"For the Broken People\".

At several of the shows, [[Ron Asheton]] formerly of The Stooges joined Mascis and Watt onstage, wherein the group would play entire sets of Stooges songs. Watt and Mascis later joined Asheton and his brother, Stooges drummer [[Scott Asheton]], for a one-time-only performance at a [[Belgium|Belgian]] festival under the name '''Asheton, Asheton, Mascis & Watt'''. In 2001, Watt was one of several bassists invited to participate in the sessions for [[Gov't Mule]]'s ''[[The Deep End, Volume 1|The Deep End]]'', partly on the recommendation of [[Primus (band)|Primus]]' [[Les Claypool]]. Watt and Gov't Mule recorded a cover version of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s \"Effigy\" for the album. The sessions were immortalized in the documentary feature film ''[[Rising Low]]''.\n\nIn 2002, Watt, along with [[Pete Yorn]] and members of [[The Hives]], backed [[Iggy Pop]] for a short set of Stooges songs at that year's [[Shortlist Music Prize]] ceremony, after which Watt was asked to play bass in the reunited Stooges lineup in 2003.

A third album with the same lineup, ''Funland'', was released in 2009 and features a semi-cover version (the original lyrics over new music) of [[Captain Beefheart]]'s \"Frownland\" (from the ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' album). Basic tracks have already been laid down for the fourth Unknown Instructors album at Secondmen organist [[Pete Mazich]]'s Casa Hanzo studio in San Pedro.\n\nWatt would further his interest in improvised music by forming a trio, Los Pumpkinheads, with former [[Beastie Boys]] keyboardist [[Money Mark]] and Caroline Bermudez.\n\nOn December 14, 2005, the McNally-Smith College of Music in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] announced the formation of the Mike Watt Bass Guitar Scholarship, which is to be awarded annually to a bass major starting in the Fall of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcnallysmith.edu/mikewatt.html |title=Bass Guitar Scholarship Programs at McNally Smith College of Music &#124; Mike Watt Scholarship |publisher=Mcnallysmith.edu |accessdate=2011-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907203317/http://www.mcnallysmith.edu/mikewatt.html |archivedate=2006-09-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, Watt took part in the performance at [[Disney Hall]], [[Los Angeles]], of [[Glenn Branca]]'s \"Hallucination City\" Symphony #13.\n\n===''The Weirdness''===\n{{Main|The Weirdness}}\nIn October 2006, Watt joined the rest of The Stooges at recording engineer [[Steve Albini]]'s [[Electrical Audio]] Studio in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to record ''[[The Weirdness]]'', the first Stooges studio album since 1973's ''[[Raw Power]]''.

They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!

The 18th Congress shall then have 306 representatives. However, as preparations were already on its way when the laws for the creation of General Santos and Southern Leyte districts were made, the commission decided to delay elections for the four seats involved to October 2019; the ballots for those districts showed their previous conflagrations as if it were not redistricted yet. A lawsuit was then decided by the Supreme Court prior to that, ordering the commission to declare the winner of the election in South Cotabato's 1st district. Upon doing so, the commission then declared the winner of the Southern Leyte district as well. The first elections for these two districts shall be on 2022, at the next general election.

They were held on May 13, 2019 to elect members to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\nCandidates were expected to be either for or against President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. As the Philippines has a [[multi-party system]], those who are for (or against) Duterte may find themselves running against each other. Other districts that may be seen as [[safe seat]]s may see a candidate elected unopposed. Several seats have not been apportioned since 1907, [[gerrymandering]] on some newly-apportioned seats and entrenchment of [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political dynasties]] make competitive races in so-called [[swing seat]]s rare. The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] is expected to lead the opposition against PDP-Laban.\n\n== Electoral system ==\nThe [[Philippines]] uses [[parallel voting]] for its lower house elections. There are currently 297 seats in the House; 238 of these are district representatives, and 59 are party-list representatives. Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the [[plurality voting system]] from [[single-member districts]]. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% \"soft\" [[election threshold]], with a 3-seat cap. The party in the party-list election with the most votes usually wins three seats, the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats, and the parties with less than 2% of the vote winning a seat each if the 20% quota is not met.\n\nCampaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an [[Slate (elections)|election slate]] that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nParty-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Participating parties==\n\n===Contesting district elections===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party !!
