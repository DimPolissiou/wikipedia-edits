{"title_page": "List of political parties in Lebanon", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Update|date=November 2010}}\n\n{{Politics of Lebanon}}\n'''[[Lebanon]]''' has numerous political parties, usually with sectarian character. Since 2005, and after the assassination of former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]], the political scene has become very polarized, with most major political parties and movements becoming part of one of two big rival alliances, the [[March 8 Alliance]] and the [[March 14 Alliance]]. Since the election of [[Michel Aoun]] as President in 2016 and the formation of a new Government headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the 14th March movement has lost momentum and the political scene has evolved into Governing Parties under the control of [[Hezbollah]] and the Free Patriotic Movement, the [[Lebanese Forces]], the [[Amal Movement]] and the Future Movement (which is Saad Hariri's political party) and Opposition parties (that were against electing Michel Aoun as president in the 2016 elections) consist of traditional parties such as the [[Kataeb]] party, the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]], and Achraf Rifi\u2019s movement, in addition to new non-sectarian political parties such as Sabaa and the Party of Lebanon and civil society movements who are considered \"independent\" (a third force) loosely allied as a group to change Lebanon.  There are also some other independent groups that are informally organised or linked to environmental activism and anti-corruption protest movements.\n\nLebanon\u2019s unique experiment of a Sectarian Democracy trying to blend democratic principles and religious allocation of roles and functions together with 18 religious laws being applied to citizens\u2019 personal status, in contradiction with the fundamental principles of democracy, the sovereignty of the people and equality of rights between the citizens has led to the sectarian division of the Lebanese people by law, to politically weak institutions, a divided nation and the chain of historical events such as the 1958 crisis and the 1975 civil war, Palestinian militant attacks against Israel from Lebanese territory, occupation of Lebanon by Syrian forces in 1976 and by Israeli forces in 1982 and the actual presence of weapons in the hands of Hezbollah which is outside the control of the Lebanese Government.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]], and is the second in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that led to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Tall Girls Productions, with Rosenberg serving as [[showrunner]]. [[Scott Reynolds (writer)|Scott Reynolds]] was a co-showrunner for the [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third season]].\n\n[[Krysten Ritter]] stars as Jessica Jones, a former superhero who opens her own detective agency. [[Rachael Taylor]], [[Eka Darville]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] also star, with [[Mike Colter]], [[Wil Traval]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], and [[David Tennant]] joining them for the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season]], [[J.R. Ramirez]], [[Terry Chen]], [[Leah Gibson]] and [[Janet McTeer]] joining the cast for [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]], and [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]], [[Sarita Choudhury]], [[Jeremy Bobb]], and Tiffany Mack joining for the third season.\n\nA version of the series was originally developed by Rosenberg for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2010, but the network passed on it. By late 2013, Rosenberg was reworking the series for Netflix as ''A.K.A. Jessica Jones''. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014. ''Jessica Jones'' is filmed in New York City, in areas that still look like old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season premiered on November 20, 2015. They were released to critical acclaim, with critics noting Ritter's and Tennant's performances as well as the series' [[Neo-noir|noir]] tone, approach to sexuality, and depiction of darker topics such as rape, assault and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]. In January 2016, Netflix renewed ''Jessica Jones'' for a second season; filming began in April 2017 and concluded in September 2017. The second season was released on March 8, 2018, and a [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third season]] was ordered on April 12, 2018, which was released on June 14, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title='Marvel's Jessica Jones' Gets Final-Season Premiere Date On Netflix|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/jessica-jones-season-3-release-date-netflix-marvel-1202623059/|work=Deadline Hollywood|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=May 28, 2019|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref> On February 18, 2019, Netflix canceled the series, making the third season its last.<ref name=\"Canceled\" />\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nJessica Jones is a super-powered woman who had a brief superhero career until an incident where the villainous [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]] caused her to kill someone.

And we're not shying away from that.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> Ritter described the character as \"very rough around the edges, and dry and sarcastic and a total asshole sometimes. But I think at her core she's a good person.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> She put on {{convert|10|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role.<ref name=\"Premiere\" /> Elizabeth Cappuccino portrayed a young Jessica.<ref name=\"Cappuccino\" />\n* [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]]: <br />A man with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin, whom Jones encounters in the course of an investigation.<ref name=\"Colter\" /><ref name=\"Colter2\" /> Colter put on {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role,<ref name=\"ColterAol\"/> and described the character as \"a darker, grittier, more tangible character than [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] or [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. He likes to keep things close to his chest, operate on the hush-hush.\"<ref name=\"Colter2\" /> Colter was pleased and surprised that the audience \"got\" the character, as Luke \"was a man of few words and a lot of subtext,\" which was refreshing: \"we were going for this character in a way that said little but spoke volumes ... I felt people got the subtleties.\"<ref name=\"ColterCBRDec2015\" />\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]]: <br />A former model and child star known as \"Patsy\", Jones' adoptive sister and best friend who now works as a radio host.<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> Jones' best friend was going to be [[Carol Danvers]] when Rosenberg was developing the series at ABC,<ref name=\"AKAComicCon2011\" /><ref name=\"Danvers\" /> and was changed to Walker due to the changing nature of the MCU and the fact that Danvers would feature in [[Captain Marvel (film)|her own film]]. Rosenberg ultimately found this to be \"much more appropriate ... it was better that [Jessica's] best friend was not someone with powers. It actually ends up being a really great mirror for her.\"<ref name=\"Danvers\" /> Loeb said, \"what's most important is the relationship between [Walker] and Jessica, and how these two women who are [sisters] could be that different, and yet believe in the same kinds of things.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" /> At the end of the second season Trish develops powers of enhanced reflexes and agility and becomes a vigilante like \"Hellcat\" in the third season. Catherine Blades portrayed a young Trish.\n* [[Wil Traval]] as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]]:<br />An [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] sergeant who is very serious about his job.<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> Traval felt that Simpson sees everything in \"black and white\" and that \"justice can be served easily,\" an opposite to Jessica, who \"deals in a world of gray\" that causes the two to have friction between them.<ref name=\"CBRNYCCNov2015\" /> Traval described the character as \"reinvented\" and \"reshaped\" for the series from the one in the comics, as the comic character was \"a little bit too hard to handle. [H]e was just a psychotic crazy guy.\"<ref name=\"CBRNYCCNov2015\" /><ref name=\"SimpsonNuke\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" />\n* [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Hope Shlottman: <br />A student-athlete attending [[New York University]] who is a client of Alias Investigations.<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"CBRNYCCNov2015\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> Moriarty called her character a \"polar opposite\" to Jessica Jones, describing Hope as \"an all-American girl, [innocent and] really earnest.\" Over the course of the series, the two form a bond, with Jessica becoming protective of Hope, due to a shared experience they have with Kilgrave.<ref name=\"MoriartyNYCC\" />\n* [[Eka Darville]] as [[Malcolm Ducasse]]: <br />Jones' neighbor who struggles with drug addiction, resulting in his personal journey intertwining with hers.<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"CBRNYCCNov2015\" /> Darville stated Malcolm was a new character for the series, though inspired by \"seed characters\" from the comics. He also felt playing the character with the drug addiction \"was pretty intense and dark\" and that Malcolm's relationship with Jessica \"is like a flip-flop between victim and savior ... much more [sibling-like] than anything else.\"<ref name=\"CBRNYCCNov2015\" />\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]]: <br />An attorney and potentially powerful ally to Jones, who hires Jones for cases.<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"VulturePilotSexuality\" /> The character's gender was changed from male to female for the series, and the character was made a lesbian.<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Moss signed on to the series after reading the first two scripts, having been pitched the character by Loeb and Rosenberg. Moss described the character as fierce, strong, and powerful, and \"she likes that power.\" She worked \"a few days every episode\", which allowed her to grow the character throughout the series, while not knowing what the character would become as she played each moment, which she noted was how real-life is.<ref name=\"MossColterNYCC2\" />\n* [[David Tennant]] as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]]: <br />A man from Jones' past who can control minds.<ref name=\"Tennant\" /> He was born Kevin Thompson and was experimented on as a young child, gaining his powers. Loeb called him \"a terrible man who doesn't see himself as terrible\" and compared him to [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]'s [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', saying, \"there are going to be times [watching ''Daredevil''] when you're uncomfortable because you're not quite rooting for Matt, you're kind of rooting for Wilson, and it's the same kind of thing you're going to find in ''Jessica''. There's going to be moments where some of the things that she does is pretty questionable. And some of the things that, when you learn about Kilgrave's character and the way that David Tennant plays that character, it's really extraordinary.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> James Freedson-Jackson portrayed a young Kilgrave.\n* [[J.R.

She was declared dead and treated in secret. The extent of her injuries and years of treatment affected her mental stability.

The series, which would be based on the comic book series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' and centered on the character [[Jessica Jones]], was intended to air in 2011 of the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 television season]], with Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], and [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]] serving as executive producers, and ''Alias'' writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] acting as a consultant.<ref name=\"AKAJones\" /> At the 2011 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], Loeb said the series was \"about a failed superhero who is rebuilding her life as a private detective in New York City\", and would include the characters [[Carol Danvers]] and [[Luke Cage]].<ref name=\"AKAComicCon2011\" /> In November, Rosenberg said the show was now \"hoping to get on the schedule for\" 2012 of the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 television season]], and added, \"I love this character. That is an incredibly damaged, dark, complex female character that kicks ass ... [she is] a former superhero with PTSD, [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].\" She also stated that, while Cage was a part of the series, the couple's daughter Danielle would appear \"way down the road\".<ref name=\"RosenbergNov2011\" /> Rosenberg said later in the month that the series would acknowledge the existence of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], with references to [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and [[Stark Industries]] in the pilot script, but admitted that \"as we go along things will alter in terms of what is made available to us, but we're definitely in that universe. We are in no way denying that that universe exists. And as much as I can I'm going to pull everything in from there that I can use\". She also confirmed that Danvers would be a principal character in the series.<ref name=\"AKAJonesMCU\" />\n\nIn May 2012, ABC president [[Paul Lee (television executive)|Paul Lee]] said the network had passed on the series.<ref name=\"AKAJonesPass\" /> Later that year, Rosenberg was shopping the show around to other networks,<ref name=\"AKAJonesShop\" /> saying \"I don't know if it's an ABC show. It might be a cable show, really. The [''Alias''] graphic novel is the first one that Marvel did that was meant to serve an adult audience. I toned it down a little bit for network, but it's very, very easy to translate that into cable. Very easy.\"<ref name=\"AKAJonesCable\" /> In October 2013, ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' reported that Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] announced that Marvel Television and ABC Studios would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Jessica Jones, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" /> Rosenberg was brought on to write and produce the new incarnation of the series, to be reconfigured from her original project,<ref name=\"THRRosenbergHired\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRosenbergHired\" /> which she called a \"page one do-over\" from her original vision.<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" /> [[Liz Friedman]] also serves as an executive producer on the series during the first season.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> In December 2014, the official title was revealed to be ''Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> However, in June 2015, Marvel revealed that the title for the series would be shortened to ''Marvel's Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> On why the title was shortened, Loeb said, \"It literally just became one of those things that happens. We had talked about whether that was the best title for it, and that's how it happened.\" Rosenberg added that the \"AKA\" would still be seen in the name of each episode.<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Netflix ordered a second season of 13 episodes.<ref name=\"S2Order\" /> [[Raelle Tucker]] joined the series as an executive producer and writer for the second season, replacing Friedman, who departed the series to work on the pilot for the ABC series ''[[Conviction (2016 TV series)|Conviction]]''.<ref name=\"TuckerEP\" /> A third season was ordered on April 12, 2018, a month after the second season was released.<ref name=\"S3Order\" /> That August, Rosenberg signed a deal to move from Netflix to [[Warner Bros. Television]] to develop new projects for the latter, after she had been looking to \"do something different\". Rosenberg remained showrunner of the series through completion of the third season,<ref name=\"RosenbergOut\" /> with [[Scott Reynolds (writer)|Scott Reynolds]] joining her as co-showrunner.<ref name=\"JJS3Showrunners\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=[We are] very aware this is the first female superhero Marvel's ever introduced as a lead. But there was never the intention of, \"this is an issue series, we're dealing with issues.\" While issues of sexual assault and women in power are all issues that I certainly feel very passionately about taking on, the show's all about exploring the inner workings of Jessica Jones and her ensemble.|source=\u2014Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg on approaching \"issues\"<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" />}}\n\nRosenberg talked about the freedom that the series had, saying that it would go \"even further in all our storytelling\" than what Brian Michael Bendis did in the ''Alias'' comic: \"That's the beauty of working with Netflix. It's 13 [episodes]. There's no pilot and then getting feedback, reaction and ratings. You're in this bubble. So, what's the story you want to tell? Where do you want to go with [the characters]?\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" /> Expanding on this, Rosenberg said that \"we start off with [Bendis'] incredible source material and Jessica Jones isn't as well known in the universe obviously as Daredevil and everyone else, so it really allows for a lot of freedom in there. So there are restrictions in terms of the Marvel [Cinematic U]niverse of certain rules of mythology, but within that it's free pass.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Rosenberg noted that the final series is very different from the version she developed for ABC because of the different mythology of the MCU.<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" />\n\nRosenberg invited Bendis to the series' writers room early on in the writing process, so the writers could ask Bendis any questions about the character. He walked away from the meeting saying, \"they were asking the right questions, and that's a good sign.\" Bendis also noted that Rosenberg was approaching the character and issues of rape and abuse differently to him, on which he said \"I made the right choice for me as a writer then and they're making the right choice for them as writers now. I thought about how much is different and how much has changed, and if it's not brought up in ''Jessica'', when will it be brought up? So I was like, 'Yeah, you should.' I thought that Melissa and the writers were the people to do that and that medium was better-suited to tell that kind of story.\"<ref name=\"BendisNov2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn August 2014, Sarandos said the series was beginning to look \"at casting Jessica.\"<ref name=\"Casting\" /> By November, [[Krysten Ritter]], [[Alexandra Daddario]], [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Jessica De Gouw]], and [[Marin Ireland]] were being tested for the role of Jessica Jones,<ref name=\"Casting2\" /> with Ritter having been auditioning since October.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Additionally, [[Lance Gross]], [[Mike Colter]], and [[Cleo Anthony]] were in contention for the role of Luke Cage, which was envisioned as a recurring role in the series before headlining ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Casting2\" /> The next month, Ritter was cast as Jessica Jones. Ritter and Palmer had been the final candidates for the role, with both auditioning opposite Colter to test chemistry.<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> Colter was confirmed as Luke Cage later in December.<ref name=\"Colter\" /> In January 2015, [[David Tennant]] was cast as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]],<ref name=\"Tennant\" /> and [[Rachael Taylor]] was cast as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]].<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> The latter character was added to the series as a replacement for Danvers, as she was set to feature in [[Captain Marvel (film)|her own film]].<ref name=\"Danvers\" /> A month later, [[Carrie-Ann Moss]] joined the cast,<ref name=\"Moss\" /> with her role revealed that October to be a female version of male comic book character [[Jeryn Hogarth]].<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Also in February, [[Eka Darville]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], and [[Wil Traval]] were cast as [[Malcolm Ducasse]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /> Hope Shlottman,<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]], respectively.<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" />\n\nRitter,<ref name=\"RitterS2\" /> Taylor,<ref name=\"TaylorS2\" /> Darville,<ref name=\"DarvilleS2\" /> and Moss return for the second season.<ref name=\"MossS2\" /> They are joined by [[J.R.

And what you might discover is that, as illustrated, they kind of do wear the same thing all the time.\" Maslansky also stated that \"everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it's not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we've created in Hell's Kitchen.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" /> On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she \"considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way.\" At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an [[Acne Studios]] leather motorcycle jacket that had any \"bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details\" removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmUQAZ7K3co The opening title sequence of ''Jessica Jones''], showcasing [[David W. Mack|David Mack]]'s artwork and composer [[Sean Callery]]'s main theme for the series.}}\nThe series' title sequence, created by Imaginary Forces,<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" /> incorporates the jazz-style theme from composer [[Sean Callery]] mixed with artwork by [[David W. Mack|David Mack]], the cover artist for the original ''Alias'' comic,<ref name=\"AliasReprint\" /> \"taking [the viewer] around seedier, noir-esque corners of Hell's Kitchen, as if through Jessica's eyes.\"<ref name=\"OpeningSequence\" />\n\nArisu Kashiwagi, lead designer at Imaginary Forces for the title sequence, was \"inspired by all the changing activity and vignettes within those rows of windows [for New York-style buildings] \u2014 the patterns of light, color, narratives, and graphic silhouettes. It is pretty amazing how much you can see and the number of windows out there with wide open shades ... I could understand our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act.\"<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" /> She also looked to [[Edward Hopper]]'s \"Night Windows\" and [[Gerhard Richter]]'s paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take \"a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack's watercolor paintings from\" ''Alias''. On the design concept, she added, \"We based the concept off of Jessica's PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device.\"<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" /> Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' to help create the \"voyeuristic approach\" as well as \"using the city as a character\" to highlight \"the dark places [and] the grit\" where Jones investigates.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> including areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]],<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> [[Douglaston, Queens]],<ref name=\"S1FilmingLocations\" /> as well as sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography for the series.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX, who also worked on ''Daredevil'', with Bryan Goodwin serving as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, Sean Callery revealed he was composing the music for the series.<ref name=\"CalleryComposer\" /> Callery did not begin composing the series' main theme until after reading two or three scripts, and did not see the opening graphics until after the second episode, at which point he had \"a framework for a theme that [he] hoped would work\". At this time, Callery said he started \"fooling around\" with ideas for the theme, and eventually settled on one that he felt had a \"sneaky and fun-ness\" quality, adding, Jessica Jones \"has dry humor, a real edge to her. But there was something to this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something.\" After creating the theme, Callery began working on the rhythmic quality of it, eventually fully orchestrating his idea into what became the resulting opening theme. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got \"bigger there because as I looked at the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y. So that's when I decided the electric guitar might be a kind of neat add there so that the whole piece will arc a little more.\"<ref name=\"CalleryVariety\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)#Music|first season]] was released digitally on June 3, 2016.<ref name=\"S1Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"S1Soundtrack2\" /> Jamie Forsyth also contributed to the music of the first season.<ref name=\"S1Soundtrack2\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Jessica Jones (season 2)#Music|second season]] was released digitally on March 16, 2018.<ref name=\"S2Soundtrack\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n''Jessica Jones'' is the second of the ordered Netflix series, after ''Daredevil'', and was followed by ''Luke Cage'' and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Marvel's Iron Fist]]'', which led to the miniseries, ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /><ref name=\"OriginalReleaseOrder\" /> In November 2013, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which Sarandos echoed in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], who played [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out.\"<ref name=\"D'OnofrioFuture\" /> In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"It all exists in the same universe. As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', it became more practical for [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" />\n\nOn specific crossovers with ''Daredevil'', which had completed its [[Daredevil (season 1)|first season]] by the time ''Jessica Jones'' began casting, Loeb said \"they're in the same area. In some cases they are in the same neighborhood. One of the things that is important to us is, when you enter the police station, it's the same police station. When you go to the hospital, you start to see the same people. [But] we don't want people suddenly going, 'Wait, is that Matt Murdock that's walking down the street?' Because that's going to feel odd, and in a weird way feel false.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> On existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, \"''Jessica Jones'' is a very, very different show than ''Daredevil''. We exist in a cinematic universe, [and] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they're very different ... That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into ''Daredevil'' or what's come before? And the answer is no.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Jessica Jones'' is available on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR).<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> The first season was enhanced to be available in HDR after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The episodes for each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been successful for [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|other Netflix original series]].<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" />\n\n===Marketing===\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]]. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products. Licensing partners wanted to pair up with Marvel, despite this not being a film project, given its previous successes.<ref name=\"Merchandise\" />\n\n===Home media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"3\"| [[DVD]] release dates\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"2\"| [[Blu-ray]] release dates\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]]\n|-\n!

Though, Karim Zreik, senior vice president of original programming at Marvel Television, provided some viewership demographics for ''Jessica Jones'' in August 2017, noting that the series has attracted a large number of female viewers.<ref name=\"ZreikViewerDemo\" /> Also in the month, Netflix released viewing patterns for the Marvel Netflix series. The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Jessica Jones'' would most often then move on to ''Daredevil'', and vice versa, with Yellin figuring that ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' would have paired up more, given that Cage was introduced on ''Jessica Jones''. The data also revealed that other \"comedies and shows with strong women\" such as ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Master of None]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' led viewers to starting ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in November 2015, the season had just under 300,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it, and when the second season was released in March 2018, the posts had declined by half, to under 150,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#6A498D;\"|\n| [[Jessica Jones (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 94% (80 reviews)<ref name=\"JJRT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica-jones/s01/|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 1 (2015)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n| 81 (32 reviews)<ref name=\"JJMC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones : Season 1 reviews|publisher=[[CBS]]|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#242217;\"|\n| [[Jessica Jones (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 83% (86 reviews)<ref name=\"JJRT2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica_jones/s02|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 2 (2018)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 70 (19 reviews)<ref name=\"JJMC2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones/season-2|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones : Season 2 reviews|publisher=[[CBS]]|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#AC1F0C;\"|\n| [[Jessica Jones (season 3)#Critical response|3]]\n| 74% (38 reviews)<ref name=\"JJRT3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica_jones/s03|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 3 (2019)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=June 14, 2019}}</ref>\n| 65 (7 reviews)<ref name=\"JJMC3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones/season-3|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 3 Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe series was met with a generally positive reception, though it suffered a slight dip in critical favor with each season.

The website's critical consensus states, \"Even if it's not the most satisfying finale for an entire era of Marvel television, Jessica Jones' final chapter finishes strong by giving its complicated heroine the space to change \u2013 and Krysten Ritter one last chance to work her sarcastic magic.\"<ref name=\"JJRT3\"/> [[Metacritic]] gave a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref name=\"JJMC3\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\nIn December 2015, IGN named ''Jessica Jones'' the best Netflix original programming series released to date.<ref name=\"IGNNetflixTop10\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]], and is the second in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|series of shows]] that led to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover miniseries. The series is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Tall Girls Productions, with Rosenberg serving as [[showrunner]]. [[Scott Reynolds (writer)|Scott Reynolds]] was a co-showrunner for the [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third season]].\n\n[[Krysten Ritter]] stars as Jessica Jones, a former superhero who opens her own detective agency. [[Rachael Taylor]], [[Eka Darville]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] also star, with [[Mike Colter]], [[Wil Traval]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], and [[David Tennant]] joining them for the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season]], [[J.R. Ramirez]], [[Terry Chen]], [[Leah Gibson]] and [[Janet McTeer]] joining the cast for [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]], and [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]], [[Sarita Choudhury]], [[Jeremy Bobb]], and Tiffany Mack joining for the third season.\n\nA version of the series was originally developed by Rosenberg for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2010, but the network passed on it. By late 2013, Rosenberg was reworking the series for Netflix as ''A.K.A. Jessica Jones''. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014. ''Jessica Jones'' is filmed in New York City, in areas that still look like old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].\n\nAll episodes of the first season premiered on November 20, 2015. They were released to critical acclaim, with critics noting Ritter's and Tennant's performances as well as the series' [[Neo-noir|noir]] tone, approach to sexuality, and depiction of darker topics such as rape, assault and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]]. In January 2016, Netflix renewed ''Jessica Jones'' for a second season; filming began in April 2017 and concluded in September 2017. The second season was released on March 8, 2018, and a [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third season]] was ordered on April 12, 2018, which was released on June 14, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title='Marvel's Jessica Jones' Gets Final-Season Premiere Date On Netflix|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/jessica-jones-season-3-release-date-netflix-marvel-1202623059/|work=Deadline Hollywood|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=May 28, 2019|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref> On February 18, 2019, Netflix canceled the series, making the third season its last.<ref name=\"Canceled\" />\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nJessica Jones is a super-powered woman who had a brief superhero career until an incident where the villainous [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]] caused her to kill someone.

And we're not shying away from that.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> Ritter described the character as \"very rough around the edges, and dry and sarcastic and a total asshole sometimes. But I think at her core she's a good person.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> She put on {{convert|10|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role.<ref name=\"Premiere\" /> Elizabeth Cappuccino portrayed a young Jessica.<ref name=\"Cappuccino\" />\n* [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]]: <br />A man with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin, whom Jones encounters in the course of an investigation.<ref name=\"Colter\" /><ref name=\"Colter2\" /> Colter put on {{convert|30|lb|kg}} of muscle for the role,<ref name=\"ColterAol\"/> and described the character as \"a darker, grittier, more tangible character than [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] or [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. He likes to keep things close to his chest, operate on the hush-hush.\"<ref name=\"Colter2\" /> Colter was pleased and surprised that the audience \"got\" the character, as Luke \"was a man of few words and a lot of subtext,\" which was refreshing: \"we were going for this character in a way that said little but spoke volumes ... I felt people got the subtleties.\"<ref name=\"ColterCBRDec2015\" />\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]]: <br />A former model and child star known as \"Patsy\", Jones' adoptive sister and best friend who now works as a radio host.<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> Jones' best friend was going to be [[Carol Danvers]] when Rosenberg was developing the series at ABC,<ref name=\"AKAComicCon2011\" /><ref name=\"Danvers\" /> and was changed to Walker due to the changing nature of the MCU and the fact that Danvers would feature in [[Captain Marvel (film)|her own film]]. Rosenberg ultimately found this to be \"much more appropriate ... it was better that [Jessica's] best friend was not someone with powers. It actually ends up being a really great mirror for her.\"<ref name=\"Danvers\" /> Loeb said, \"what's most important is the relationship between [Walker] and Jessica, and how these two women who are [sisters] could be that different, and yet believe in the same kinds of things.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" /> At the end of the second season Trish develops powers of enhanced reflexes and agility and becomes a vigilante like \"Hellcat\" in the third season.

He also felt playing the character with the drug addiction \"was pretty intense and dark\" and that Malcolm's relationship with Jessica \"is like a flip-flop between victim and savior ... much more [sibling-like] than anything else.\"<ref name=\"CBRNYCCNov2015\" />\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]]: <br />An attorney and potentially powerful ally to Jones, who hires Jones for cases.<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"VulturePilotSexuality\" /> The character's gender was changed from male to female for the series, and the character was made a lesbian.<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Moss signed on to the series after reading the first two scripts, having been pitched the character by Loeb and Rosenberg. Moss described the character as fierce, strong, and powerful, and \"she likes that power.\" She worked \"a few days every episode\", which allowed her to grow the character throughout the series, while not knowing what the character would become as she played each moment, which she noted was how real-life is.<ref name=\"MossColterNYCC2\" />\n* [[David Tennant]] as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]]: <br />A man from Jones' past who can control minds.<ref name=\"Tennant\" /> He was born Kevin Thompson and was experimented on as a young child, gaining his powers. Loeb called him \"a terrible man who doesn't see himself as terrible\" and compared him to [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]'s [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', saying, \"there are going to be times [watching ''Daredevil''] when you're uncomfortable because you're not quite rooting for Matt, you're kind of rooting for Wilson, and it's the same kind of thing you're going to find in ''Jessica''. There's going to be moments where some of the things that she does is pretty questionable. And some of the things that, when you learn about Kilgrave's character and the way that David Tennant plays that character, it's really extraordinary.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> James Freedson-Jackson portrayed a young Kilgrave.\n* [[J.R.

She was declared dead and treated in secret. The extent of her injuries and years of treatment affected her mental stability.

The series, which would be based on the comic book series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' and centered on the character [[Jessica Jones]], was intended to air in 2011 of the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 television season]], with Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], and [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]] serving as executive producers, and ''Alias'' writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] acting as a consultant.<ref name=\"AKAJones\" /> At the 2011 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], Loeb said the series was \"about a failed superhero who is rebuilding her life as a private detective in New York City\", and would include the characters [[Carol Danvers]] and [[Luke Cage]].<ref name=\"AKAComicCon2011\" /> In November, Rosenberg said the show was now \"hoping to get on the schedule for\" 2012 of the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 television season]], and added, \"I love this character. That is an incredibly damaged, dark, complex female character that kicks ass ... [she is] a former superhero with PTSD, [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].\" She also stated that, while Cage was a part of the series, the couple's daughter Danielle would appear \"way down the road\".<ref name=\"RosenbergNov2011\" /> Rosenberg said later in the month that the series would acknowledge the existence of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], with references to [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and [[Stark Industries]] in the pilot script, but admitted that \"as we go along things will alter in terms of what is made available to us, but we're definitely in that universe. We are in no way denying that that universe exists. And as much as I can I'm going to pull everything in from there that I can use\". She also confirmed that Danvers would be a principal character in the series.<ref name=\"AKAJonesMCU\" />\n\nIn May 2012, ABC president [[Paul Lee (television executive)|Paul Lee]] said the network had passed on the series.<ref name=\"AKAJonesPass\" /> Later that year, Rosenberg was shopping the show around to other networks,<ref name=\"AKAJonesShop\" /> saying \"I don't know if it's an ABC show. It might be a cable show, really. The [''Alias''] graphic novel is the first one that Marvel did that was meant to serve an adult audience. I toned it down a little bit for network, but it's very, very easy to translate that into cable. Very easy.\"<ref name=\"AKAJonesCable\" /> In October 2013, ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' reported that Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct2013\" /> A few weeks later, Marvel and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] announced that Marvel Television and ABC Studios would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Jessica Jones, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" /> Rosenberg was brought on to write and produce the new incarnation of the series, to be reconfigured from her original project,<ref name=\"THRRosenbergHired\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRosenbergHired\" /> which she called a \"page one do-over\" from her original vision.<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" /> [[Liz Friedman]] also serves as an executive producer on the series during the first season.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> In December 2014, the official title was revealed to be ''Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> However, in June 2015, Marvel revealed that the title for the series would be shortened to ''Marvel's Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> On why the title was shortened, Loeb said, \"It literally just became one of those things that happens. We had talked about whether that was the best title for it, and that's how it happened.\" Rosenberg added that the \"AKA\" would still be seen in the name of each episode.<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Netflix ordered a second season of 13 episodes.<ref name=\"S2Order\" /> [[Raelle Tucker]] joined the series as an executive producer and writer for the second season, replacing Friedman, who departed the series to work on the pilot for the ABC series ''[[Conviction (2016 TV series)|Conviction]]''.<ref name=\"TuckerEP\" /> A third season was ordered on April 12, 2018, a month after the second season was released.<ref name=\"S3Order\" /> That August, Rosenberg signed a deal to move from Netflix to [[Warner Bros. Television]] to develop new projects for the latter, after she had been looking to \"do something different\". Rosenberg remained showrunner of the series through completion of the third season,<ref name=\"RosenbergOut\" /> with [[Scott Reynolds (writer)|Scott Reynolds]] joining her as co-showrunner.<ref name=\"JJS3Showrunners\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=[We are] very aware this is the first female superhero Marvel's ever introduced as a lead. But there was never the intention of, \"this is an issue series, we're dealing with issues.\" While issues of sexual assault and women in power are all issues that I certainly feel very passionately about taking on, the show's all about exploring the inner workings of Jessica Jones and her ensemble.|source=\u2014Showrunner Melissa Rosenberg on approaching \"issues\"<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" />}}\n\nRosenberg talked about the freedom that the series had, saying that it would go \"even further in all our storytelling\" than what Brian Michael Bendis did in the ''Alias'' comic: \"That's the beauty of working with Netflix. It's 13 [episodes]. There's no pilot and then getting feedback, reaction and ratings. You're in this bubble. So, what's the story you want to tell? Where do you want to go with [the characters]?\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" /> Expanding on this, Rosenberg said that \"we start off with [Bendis'] incredible source material and Jessica Jones isn't as well known in the universe obviously as Daredevil and everyone else, so it really allows for a lot of freedom in there. So there are restrictions in terms of the Marvel [Cinematic U]niverse of certain rules of mythology, but within that it's free pass.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Rosenberg noted that the final series is very different from the version she developed for ABC because of the different mythology of the MCU.<ref name=\"RosenbergSecondSeason\" />\n\nRosenberg invited Bendis to the series' writers room early on in the writing process, so the writers could ask Bendis any questions about the character. He walked away from the meeting saying, \"they were asking the right questions, and that's a good sign.\" Bendis also noted that Rosenberg was approaching the character and issues of rape and abuse differently to him, on which he said \"I made the right choice for me as a writer then and they're making the right choice for them as writers now. I thought about how much is different and how much has changed, and if it's not brought up in ''Jessica'', when will it be brought up? So I was like, 'Yeah, you should.' I thought that Melissa and the writers were the people to do that and that medium was better-suited to tell that kind of story.\"<ref name=\"BendisNov2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn August 2014, Sarandos said the series was beginning to look \"at casting Jessica.\"<ref name=\"Casting\" /> By November, [[Krysten Ritter]], [[Alexandra Daddario]], [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Jessica De Gouw]], and [[Marin Ireland]] were being tested for the role of Jessica Jones,<ref name=\"Casting2\" /> with Ritter having been auditioning since October.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Additionally, [[Lance Gross]], [[Mike Colter]], and [[Cleo Anthony]] were in contention for the role of Luke Cage, which was envisioned as a recurring role in the series before headlining ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Casting2\" /> The next month, Ritter was cast as Jessica Jones. Ritter and Palmer had been the final candidates for the role, with both auditioning opposite Colter to test chemistry.<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> Colter was confirmed as Luke Cage later in December.<ref name=\"Colter\" /> In January 2015, [[David Tennant]] was cast as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]],<ref name=\"Tennant\" /> and [[Rachael Taylor]] was cast as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]].<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> The latter character was added to the series as a replacement for Danvers, as she was set to feature in [[Captain Marvel (film)|her own film]].<ref name=\"Danvers\" /> A month later, [[Carrie-Ann Moss]] joined the cast,<ref name=\"Moss\" /> with her role revealed that October to be a female version of male comic book character [[Jeryn Hogarth]].<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Also in February, [[Eka Darville]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], and [[Wil Traval]] were cast as [[Malcolm Ducasse]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /> Hope Shlottman,<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]], respectively.<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" />\n\nRitter,<ref name=\"RitterS2\" /> Taylor,<ref name=\"TaylorS2\" /> Darville,<ref name=\"DarvilleS2\" /> and Moss return for the second season.<ref name=\"MossS2\" /> They are joined by [[J.R.

And what you might discover is that, as illustrated, they kind of do wear the same thing all the time.\" Maslansky also stated that \"everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it's not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we've created in Hell's Kitchen.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" /> On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she \"considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way.\" At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an [[Acne Studios]] leather motorcycle jacket that had any \"bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details\" removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmUQAZ7K3co The opening title sequence of ''Jessica Jones''], showcasing [[David W.

It is pretty amazing how much you can see and the number of windows out there with wide open shades ... I could understand our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act.\"<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" /> She also looked to [[Edward Hopper]]'s \"Night Windows\" and [[Gerhard Richter]]'s paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take \"a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack's watercolor paintings from\" ''Alias''. On the design concept, she added, \"We based the concept off of Jessica's PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device.\"<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" /> Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' to help create the \"voyeuristic approach\" as well as \"using the city as a character\" to highlight \"the dark places [and] the grit\" where Jones investigates.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the series takes place in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> including areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]],<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> [[Douglaston, Queens]],<ref name=\"S1FilmingLocations\" /> as well as sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography for the series.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX, who also worked on ''Daredevil'', with Bryan Goodwin serving as visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, Sean Callery revealed he was composing the music for the series.<ref name=\"CalleryComposer\" /> Callery did not begin composing the series' main theme until after reading two or three scripts, and did not see the opening graphics until after the second episode, at which point he had \"a framework for a theme that [he] hoped would work\". At this time, Callery said he started \"fooling around\" with ideas for the theme, and eventually settled on one that he felt had a \"sneaky and fun-ness\" quality, adding, Jessica Jones \"has dry humor, a real edge to her. But there was something to this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something.\" After creating the theme, Callery began working on the rhythmic quality of it, eventually fully orchestrating his idea into what became the resulting opening theme. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got \"bigger there because as I looked at the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y. So that's when I decided the electric guitar might be a kind of neat add there so that the whole piece will arc a little more.\"<ref name=\"CalleryVariety\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)#Music|first season]] was released digitally on June 3, 2016.<ref name=\"S1Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"S1Soundtrack2\" /> Jamie Forsyth also contributed to the music of the first season.<ref name=\"S1Soundtrack2\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Jessica Jones (season 2)#Music|second season]] was released digitally on March 16, 2018.<ref name=\"S2Soundtrack\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\n''Jessica Jones'' is the second of the ordered Netflix series, after ''Daredevil'', and was followed by ''Luke Cage'' and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Marvel's Iron Fist]]'', which led to the miniseries, ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"CageThird\" /><ref name=\"OriginalReleaseOrder\" /> In November 2013, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, \"It's quite possible that they could become feature films,\"<ref name=\"VarietyTVNov2013\" /> which Sarandos echoed in July 2015.<ref name=\"SarandosJuly2015\" /> In August 2014, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], who played [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', stated that after the \"series stuff with Netflix\", Marvel has \"a bigger plan to branch out.\"<ref name=\"D'OnofrioFuture\" /> In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]] and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC television series]], saying, \"It all exists in the same universe. As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', it became more practical for [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] to do a little crossover into ''[[Thor: The Dark World|Thor 2]]'' and for [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to appear at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going.\"<ref name=\"LoebDigitalSpy\" />\n\nOn specific crossovers with ''Daredevil'', which had completed its [[Daredevil (season 1)|first season]] by the time ''Jessica Jones'' began casting, Loeb said \"they're in the same area. In some cases they are in the same neighborhood. One of the things that is important to us is, when you enter the police station, it's the same police station. When you go to the hospital, you start to see the same people. [But] we don't want people suddenly going, 'Wait, is that Matt Murdock that's walking down the street?' Because that's going to feel odd, and in a weird way feel false.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> On existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, \"''Jessica Jones'' is a very, very different show than ''Daredevil''. We exist in a cinematic universe, [and] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they're very different ... That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into ''Daredevil'' or what's come before? And the answer is no.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Jessica Jones'' is available on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR).<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> The first season was enhanced to be available in HDR after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" /> The episodes for each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage [[binge-watching]], a format which has been successful for [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|other Netflix original series]].<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" />\n\n===Marketing===\n[[Disney Consumer Products]] created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience, given the show's edgier tone. Paul Gitter, senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people, with products at outlets like [[Hot Topic]]. Additionally, a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series, which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products. Licensing partners wanted to pair up with Marvel, despite this not being a film project, given its previous successes.<ref name=\"Merchandise\" />\n\n===Home media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"3\"| [[DVD]] release dates\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"2\"| [[Blu-ray]] release dates\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]]\n|-\n!

Though, Karim Zreik, senior vice president of original programming at Marvel Television, provided some viewership demographics for ''Jessica Jones'' in August 2017, noting that the series has attracted a large number of female viewers.<ref name=\"ZreikViewerDemo\" /> Also in the month, Netflix released viewing patterns for the Marvel Netflix series. The data, which came from Netflix's \"1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch\", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with ''Jessica Jones'', then ''Daredevil'', ''Luke Cage'' and finally ''Iron Fist''. Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series \"in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them.\" Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching ''Jessica Jones'' would most often then move on to ''Daredevil'', and vice versa, with Yellin figuring that ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' would have paired up more, given that Cage was introduced on ''Jessica Jones''. The data also revealed that other \"comedies and shows with strong women\" such as ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Master of None]]'' and ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' led viewers to starting ''Jessica Jones''.<ref name=\"NetflixAug2017ViewingPatterns\" /> In October 2018, Crimson Hexagon, a consumer insights company, released data that examined the \"social-media buzz\" for the series to try to correlate it with potential viewership. The data showed that when the first season premiered in November 2015, the season had just under 300,000 Twitter and Instagram posts regarding it, and when the second season was released in March 2018, the posts had declined by half, to under 150,000.<ref name=\"CrimsonHexagonData\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#6A498D;\"|\n| [[Jessica Jones (season 1)#Critical response|1]]\n| 94% (80 reviews)<ref name=\"JJRT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica-jones/s01/|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 1 (2015)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n| 81 (32 reviews)<ref name=\"JJMC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones : Season 1 reviews|publisher=[[CBS]]|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#242217;\"|\n| [[Jessica Jones (season 2)#Critical response|2]]\n| 83% (86 reviews)<ref name=\"JJRT2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica_jones/s02|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 2 (2018)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n| 70 (19 reviews)<ref name=\"JJMC2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones/season-2|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones : Season 2 reviews|publisher=[[CBS]]|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#AC1F0C;\"|\n| [[Jessica Jones (season 3)#Critical response|3]]\n| 74% (38 reviews)<ref name=\"JJRT3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica_jones/s03|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 3 (2019)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=June 14, 2019}}</ref>\n| 65 (7 reviews)<ref name=\"JJMC3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones/season-3|title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 3 Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe series was met with a generally positive reception, though it suffered a slight dip in critical favor with each season. For its first season, the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 94% approval rating with an average rating of 8.24/10, based on 80 reviews.

The website's critical consensus states, \"Even if it's not the most satisfying finale for an entire era of Marvel television, Jessica Jones' final chapter finishes strong by giving its complicated heroine the space to change \u2013 and Krysten Ritter one last chance to work her sarcastic magic.\"<ref name=\"JJRT3\"/> [[Metacritic]] gave a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref name=\"JJMC3\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\nIn December 2015, IGN named ''Jessica Jones'' the best Netflix original programming series released to date.<ref name=\"IGNNetflixTop10\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

The name was voted upon by students, staff and administration in 2001 from a selection of choices. Thus, the school became a P-12 (prep to year twelve) school for state enrolments. The amalgamation also created 3 sub schools; 'The Junior School' catering for grades prep to 5, 'The Middle School' catering for grades 6 to 9 and 'The Senior School' catering for grades 10 to 12.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kelvingrovesc.eq.edu.au/Pages/default.aspx|title=Kelvin Grove SC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=30 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the school joined the Healthy State system and removed a large proportion of [[junk food]], including all soft drinks.\n\nIn 2016, Kelvin Grove State College became an independent public school.\n\nIn 2017, Kelvin Grove announced Michele Bridges as their Nutrition Ambassador for the Sporting Excellence programs.\n\n==Motto==\n\nThe school's motto is 'The Pursuit of Excellence With All Thy Might'. The old motto ,which appears in the school anthem, 'Scientia ad Sidera' (Latin for '''knowledge to the stars''<nowiki/>'), was the Kelvin Grove State High School motto before amalgamation. The motto of Kelvin Grove State School, 'With All Thy Might' remains an underlying principle of the school, and awards under the name of this motto are awarded for high levels of drive and passion, regardless of academic performance. On most certificates, awards and emblems, the motto, 'With All Thy Might' is used.\n\n== Schools of excellence ==\n\nAs of 2013, the College has a number of schools of excellence, which students can choose to extend their learning choices in a particular field. They are: (Year Levels available to)\n* Engineering Technology School of Excellence (11-12)\n* Queensland Aviation School of Excellence (10-12)\n* Queensland Dance School of Excellence (7-9)\n* Queensland Golf School of Excellence (4-12)\n* Queensland Football School of Excellence (6-12)\n* Queensland Tennis School of Excellence (5-12)\n* Art and Design School of Excellence (11-12)\n* Music School of Excellence (3-12)\n* Queensland Senior Ballet Program (10-12)\n\nSome limitations do apply to entry and an audition process is usually required to gain entry. All these schools of excellence are an extra cost to the free education provided by a state school. Limited scholarships are available to some applicants.\n\n[[Isaka Cernak]] & [[Adam Sarota]] who play for Brisbane Roar as well as [[Robbie Kruse]] who plays for Melbourne Victory and [[Scott Higgins]] who is signed for Gold Coast United in the A-league are former students with KGSC's Soccer Excellence.\n\n[[David Williams (Australian association footballer)|David Williams (footballer)]] is another former student of the Soccer Excellence. Williams now plays for The Wellington Phoenix has two caps for the [[Socceroos]] (Australian National Team).\n\n==Arts==\nThe Performing Arts Department offers courses in drama, dance and music with links to QUT\u2019s \"Creative Industries\" program. Students can also expand their performing arts studies with the following specialised programs:\n\n*Queensland Senior Ballet Program (QBSP) in partnership with [[Queensland Ballet]] (Years 10-12) QBSP is a comprehensive, part-time program which consists of four hours of dance training in the mornings and three hours of academic classes each weekday afternoon, with a further five hours of dance training on Saturdays.\n\nKelvin Grove also has the largest Visual Art department in Queensland, with a dedicated art faculty and computer design laboratories.\n\nKelvin Grove music student Sarah Bakker has performed in numerous roles including the understudy in Phantom Of The Opera, the cast toured around Australia in 2008 and 2009.\n\nMany QDSE dancers, vocalists, choir members and a select group of musicians have taken part in celebrations and concerts such as the Q150 Creative Generations concert at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre.\n\nKelvin Grove has an excellent Instrumental Music Program. In 2013, the Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble and Corelli Strings toured to Sydney. The Percussion Ensemble perform regularly at school events and competitions throughout Brisbane.\n\n== Sporting houses ==\n\nThere are four sporting houses at KGSC which were also the sporting houses of KGSHS:\n# Herbert\n# Lutwyche\n# Petrie\n# Bowen\n\nThe houses were originally based on the first letter surname, however, to even out the numbers in each house this has become less obvious. In previous years, members of Schools of Excellence were all placed in the same sporting house, however this was unfair on other houses and the policy was scrapped. The names of the houses are all derived from important persons in the development of Queensland. Many suburbs near the school are also named after these people, and so many students have come to believe that the houses are named after the suburbs.\n\n01101000 01110010 01100101 01101110 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01110101 01100011 01101011 01110011 00100000 01100100 01101001 01100011 01101011\n\nThe primary school used to have its own separate houses before amalgamation.

The name was voted upon by students, staff and administration in 2001 from a selection of choices. Thus, the school became a P-12 (prep to year twelve) school for state enrolments. The amalgamation also created 3 sub schools; 'The Junior School' catering for grades prep to 5, 'The Middle School' catering for grades 6 to 9 and 'The Senior School' catering for grades 10 to 12.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kelvingrovesc.eq.edu.au/Pages/default.aspx|title=Kelvin Grove SC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=30 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the school joined the Healthy State system and removed a large proportion of [[junk food]], including all soft drinks.\n\nIn 2016, Kelvin Grove State College became an independent public school.\n\nIn 2017, Kelvin Grove announced Michele Bridges as their Nutrition Ambassador for the Sporting Excellence programs.\n\n==Motto==\n\nThe school's motto is 'The Pursuit of Excellence With All Thy Might'. The old motto ,which appears in the school anthem, 'Scientia ad Sidera' (Latin for '''knowledge to the stars''<nowiki/>'), was the Kelvin Grove State High School motto before amalgamation. The motto of Kelvin Grove State School, 'With All Thy Might' remains an underlying principle of the school, and awards under the name of this motto are awarded for high levels of drive and passion, regardless of academic performance. On most certificates, awards and emblems, the motto, 'With All Thy Might' is used.\n\n== Schools of excellence ==\n\nAs of 2013, the College has a number of schools of excellence, which students can choose to extend their learning choices in a particular field. They are: (Year Levels available to)\n* Engineering Technology School of Excellence (11-12)\n* Queensland Aviation School of Excellence (10-12)\n* Queensland Dance School of Excellence (7-9)\n* Queensland Golf School of Excellence (4-12)\n* Queensland Football School of Excellence (6-12)\n* Queensland Tennis School of Excellence (5-12)\n* Art and Design School of Excellence (11-12)\n* Music School of Excellence (3-12)\n* Queensland Senior Ballet Program (10-12)\n\nSome limitations do apply to entry and an audition process is usually required to gain entry. All these schools of excellence are an extra cost to the free education provided by a state school. Limited scholarships are available to some applicants.\n\n[[Isaka Cernak]] & [[Adam Sarota]] who play for Brisbane Roar as well as [[Robbie Kruse]] who plays for Melbourne Victory and [[Scott Higgins]] who is signed for Gold Coast United in the A-league are former students with KGSC's Soccer Excellence.\n\n[[David Williams (Australian association footballer)|David Williams (footballer)]] is another former student of the Soccer Excellence. Williams now plays for The Wellington Phoenix has two caps for the [[Socceroos]] (Australian National Team).\n\n==Arts==\nThe Performing Arts Department offers courses in drama, dance and music with links to QUT\u2019s \"Creative Industries\" program. Students can also expand their performing arts studies with the following specialised programs:\n\n*Queensland Senior Ballet Program (QBSP) in partnership with [[Queensland Ballet]] (Years 10-12) QBSP is a comprehensive, part-time program which consists of four hours of dance training in the mornings and three hours of academic classes each weekday afternoon, with a further five hours of dance training on Saturdays.\n\nKelvin Grove also has the largest Visual Art department in Queensland, with a dedicated art faculty and computer design laboratories.\n\nKelvin Grove music student Sarah Bakker has performed in numerous roles including the understudy in Phantom Of The Opera, the cast toured around Australia in 2008 and 2009.\n\nMany QDSE dancers, vocalists, choir members and a select group of musicians have taken part in celebrations and concerts such as the Q150 Creative Generations concert at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre.\n\nKelvin Grove has an excellent Instrumental Music Program. In 2013, the Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble and Corelli Strings toured to Sydney. The Percussion Ensemble perform regularly at school events and competitions throughout Brisbane.\n\n== Sporting houses ==\n\nThere are four sporting houses at KGSC which were also the sporting houses of KGSHS:\n# Herbert\n# Lutwyche\n# Petrie\n# Bowen\n\nThe houses were originally based on the first letter surname, however, to even out the numbers in each house this has become less obvious. In previous years, members of Schools of Excellence were all placed in the same sporting house, however this was unfair on other houses and the policy was scrapped. The names of the houses are all derived from important persons in the development of Queensland. Many suburbs near the school are also named after these people, and so many students have come to believe that the houses are named after the suburbs.\n\nThe primary school used to have its own separate houses before amalgamation. They were Long (yellow), Bancroft (red) and Walker (Blue).
