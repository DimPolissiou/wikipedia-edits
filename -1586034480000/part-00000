Young Guru, who had taken piano lessons as a child, used the money he received from the tour to fund a six-month music recording course at [[Omega Recording Studios]] in Rockville, Maryland, which had a great impact on him. After Omega, Young Guru engineered Nonchalant's second album, which was never released, but the producer, [[Chucky Thompson]] ([[Mary J. Blige]], [[Faith Evans]]) recognized the young engineer's potential and invited him to come and work with him in Washington DC. In 1999, Young Guru went independent and moved to New York, where he worked with [[D-Dot|Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie]] on his Madd Rapper project and with [[Memphis Bleek]].

Young Guru, who had taken piano lessons as a child, used the money he received from the tour to fund a six-month music recording course at [[Omega Recording Studios]] in Rockville, Maryland, which had a great impact on him. After Omega, Young Guru engineered Nonchalant's second album, which was never released, but the producer, [[Chucky Thompson]] ([[Mary J. Blige]], [[Faith Evans]]) recognized the young engineer's potential and invited him to come and work with him in Washington DC.
