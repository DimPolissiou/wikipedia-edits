Despite a decision to end the work stoppage in the lumber strike, by September shipments of spruce \u2014 a strong and flexible wood urgently needed for the production of military aircraft \u2014 had risen only to 2.6 million board feet per month, a fraction of the 10 million board feet required.<ref name=Tyler102>Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 102.</ref> Col.

Within six months of its establishment some 80,000 workers had taken the organization's pledge, rising to nearly 100,000 civilian workers in 1918.<ref>Nancy Gentile Ford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nbeJzxnOOMgC&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Great War and America: Civil-Military Relations during World War I.''] Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2008; pg. 69.</ref>\n\nThe [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] Industrial Workers of the World found itself isolated and submerged by the massive new ''de facto'' company union,<ref name=Tyler105 /> with repression of some of its leading activists adding to the IWW's difficult organizational situation.

In February 1918 Col. Disque established a committee of 25 prominent lumbermen in Portland and charged them with devising an agreement to establishing the 8-hour day in the lumber industry.<ref name=Tyler106>Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 106.</ref> Pressure from Disque and the Wilson administration in Washington \u2014 the chief consumer of finished goods \u2014 was instrumental in ensuring a positive outcome, and the marathon session of lumbermen eventually yielded fruit. On the morning of March 1, 1918, Disque announced the adoption of the 8-hour day to the press.<ref name=Tyler106 />\n\nAt the end of the war the Loyal Legion was represented by over 1000 locals organized into 12 districts.<ref name=Tyler109 /> From the US government's perspective the organization was a massive success, with production of spruce boosted to more than 20 million board-feet per month.<ref name=Tyler109 />\n\n===After World War I===\n[[File:Tree for SPD.jpg|thumb|220px|A tree felled for production by US troops.]]\n\nThe LLLL, seen as a model institution of [[class collaboration]], survived after the termination of World War I in November 1918 \u2014 having largely ameliorated the bitter strife between workers and capitalists that had swept the industry over previous years. The organization was seen as something of value by both sides of the production process [citation needed].\n\nTwo conventions were held in December 1918, one in Portland, participated in by the 8 districts of Western Oregon and Washington, and another in [[Spokane]], including the four districts spread across the so-called [[Inland Northwest (United States)|Inland Empire]] of Central and Eastern Washington state.<ref name=Tyler112>Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 112.</ref> These conventions elected a new civilian board of executives and began the work of preparing a permanent constitution.<ref name=Tyler112 />\n\nThe new constitution provided for annual conventions for each of the 12 districts, to which each local was to elect one worker delegate and one employer delegate.<ref name=Tyler112 /> The president of the organization or any member of the board of directors was to preside over each of these gatherings.<ref name=Tyler112 /> The board of directors was to serve as the decision-making authority in the case of disagreements which could not be resolved.<ref name=Tyler112 />\n\nThe LLLL provided a variety of membership services. No fewer than 5 of the 12 district offices maintained free employment agencies for workers seeking employment.<ref name=Tyler113>Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 113.</ref> In many other towns around the region, the Loyal Legion maintained social halls, providing recreational opportunities for workers.<ref name=Tyler113 /> The reforms of the war period were defended as best they were able by the board of directors through traveling inspectors, although these did not retain the same sort of authority wielded by the officer-organizers of the military during wartime.<ref name=Tyler113 /> From 1926, the board of directors negotiated a [[group insurance]] plan for sickness or on-the-job accidents covering LLLL members.<ref>''Four L Lumber News,'' July 1926, pg. 13, cited in Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 113.</ref>\n\n===Termination and legacy===\nOver time participation in the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen declined, replaced by other more aggressive labor organizations. The LLLL was finally terminated in 1938.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/gregoryj/strike/mickelson.htm The Origins of the Loyal Legion of Loggers & Lumbermen:  The Origins of the World\u2019s Largest Company Union and How it Conducted Business], Seattle General Strike Project, directed by James Gregory and sponsored by the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies at the University of Washington, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe group is remembered by historians for the role it played in helping to end the major influence of the Industrial Workers of the World in the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest. It was, as historian Robert L. Tyler has recalled, the \"carrot\" of ameliorative reform that accompanied the \"stick\" of violence and deportation used against the IWW in the Western timber industry:\n\n<blockquote>The Loyal Legion...undercut the IWW quite effectively. In the summer of 1917, the IWW appeared to control an entire industry, but by the end of the war, the IWW was not only suppressed, it had been dispersed and absorbed.... In the minds of all but the most dedicated Wobblies the ferocious ideas of the [[class struggle]] evaporated in the atmosphere of patriotism, the [[eight-hour day]], and palpable improvements of living conditions. The Wobblies of hard revolutionary substance had to be driven with the club rather than led by the carrot.<ref>Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 115.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the view of historian Harold M. Hyman, the 4L was a largely spontaneous entity, not the product of \"deliberate academic estimations conducted in a sober committee room,\" but rather a \"reflexive, unplanned, and opportunistic creation.\"<ref>Hyman, ''Soldiers and Spruce,'' pg. 13.</ref> Hyman depicts the Loyal Legion as a manifestation of \"a kind of [[Progressivism]] in khaki\" \u2014 an example of the Wilson administration's willingness to use government intervention to rationalize the [[class struggle|competitive struggle]] that was part and parcel of [[capitalism]].<ref>Hyman, ''Soldiers and Spruce,'' pp. 15-16.</ref>\n\n==Official organ==\nBeginning in March 1918 the Spruce Production Division of the Army and the Loyal Legion published a magazine in Portland, Oregon called the [https://archive.org/details/LoyalLegionOfLoggersAndLumbermenMonthlyBulletinVol1AndVol2 ''Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen Monthly Bulletin.''] The publication seems to have been terminated early in 1919.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spruce Production Division]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cloice R.

No fewer than 5 of the 12 district offices maintained free employment agencies for workers seeking employment.<ref name=Tyler113>Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 113.</ref> In many other towns around the region, the Loyal Legion maintained social halls, providing recreational opportunities for workers.<ref name=Tyler113 /> The reforms of the war period were defended as best they were able by the board of directors through traveling inspectors, although these did not retain the same sort of authority wielded by the officer-organizers of the military during wartime.<ref name=Tyler113 /> From 1926, the board of directors negotiated a [[group insurance]] plan for sickness or on-the-job accidents covering LLLL members.<ref>''Four L Lumber News,'' July 1926, pg. 13, cited in Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 113.</ref>\n\n===Termination and legacy===\nOver time participation in the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen declined, replaced by other more aggressive labor organizations. The LLLL was finally terminated in 1938.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/gregoryj/strike/mickelson.htm The Origins of the Loyal Legion of Loggers & Lumbermen:  The Origins of the World\u2019s Largest Company Union and How it Conducted Business], Seattle General Strike Project, directed by James Gregory and sponsored by the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies at the University of Washington, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe group is remembered by historians for the role it played in helping to end the major influence of the Industrial Workers of the World in the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest. It was, as historian Robert L. Tyler has recalled, the \"carrot\" of ameliorative reform that accompanied the \"stick\" of violence and deportation used against the IWW in the Western timber industry:\n\n<blockquote>The Loyal Legion...undercut the IWW quite effectively. In the summer of 1917, the IWW appeared to control an entire industry, but by the end of the war, the IWW was not only suppressed, it had been dispersed and absorbed.... In the minds of all but the most dedicated Wobblies the ferocious ideas of the [[class struggle]] evaporated in the atmosphere of patriotism, the [[eight-hour day]], and palpable improvements of living conditions. The Wobblies of hard revolutionary substance had to be driven with the club rather than led by the carrot.<ref>Tyler, ''Rebels of the Woods,'' pg. 115.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the view of historian Harold M. Hyman, the 4L was a largely spontaneous entity, not the product of \"deliberate academic estimations conducted in a sober committee room,\" but rather a \"reflexive, unplanned, and opportunistic creation.\"<ref>Hyman, ''Soldiers and Spruce,'' pg. 13.</ref> Hyman depicts the Loyal Legion as a manifestation of \"a kind of [[Progressivism]] in khaki\" \u2014 an example of the Wilson administration's willingness to use government intervention to rationalize the [[class struggle|competitive struggle]] that was part and parcel of [[capitalism]].<ref>Hyman, ''Soldiers and Spruce,'' pp. 15-16.</ref>\n\n==Official organ==\nBeginning in March 1918 the Spruce Production Division of the Army and the Loyal Legion published a magazine in Portland, Oregon called the [https://archive.org/details/LoyalLegionOfLoggersAndLumbermenMonthlyBulletinVol1AndVol2 ''Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen Monthly Bulletin.''] The publication seems to have been terminated early in 1919.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spruce Production Division]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cloice R.

He set on foot inquiries on the subject in London, and when a rumour reached him that the news of the earl's death was known at [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] on the very day of, if not before, the occurrence, he posted off thither.

For a time he was let out on bail, but on 7 February 1683/4 he was tried with Mr. [[Hugh Speke]] at the king's bench on the accusation of conspiring to spread the belief that the Earl of Essex was murdered by some persons about him, and of endeavouring to [[suborn]] witnesses to testify the same. Braddon was found guilty on all the counts, but Speke was acquitted of the latter charge.

Braddon also published 'The Constitutions of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen,' and an 'Abstract of the Rules, Orders, and Constitutions' of the same company, both of them issued in 1708. 'The Miseries of the Poor are a National Sin, Shame, and Danger' was the title of a work (1717) in which he argued for the establishment of guardians of the poor and inspectors for the encouragement of arts and manufactures. Five years later he brought out 'Particular Answers to the most material Objections made to the Proposals for relieving the Poor.' The report of his trial was printed in 1684, and reprinted in '[[William Cobbett|Cobbett's]] [[State Trials]],' ix. 1127\u20131228, and his impeachment of Bishop Burnet's 'History' is reprinted in the same volume of Cobbett, pp.&nbsp;1229\u20131332.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Braddon, Laurence}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Braddon, Laurence}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing]]\n[[Category:1724 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Cornish writers]]\n[[Category:English politicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century English writers]]\n[[Category:18th-century male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n'''Laurence Braddon''' (died 29 November 1724), was an English politician and writer.\n\n==Biography==\nBraddon was the second son of William Braddon of [[Treworgy]], in [[St Gennys]], [[Cornwall]] and studied law at the [[Inner Temple]].\n\nHe was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1681.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27braddon%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher = Royal Society|accessdate = 2012-03-15}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex]] died in [[Tower of London|the Tower]] in 1683, Braddon adopted the belief that he had been murdered, and worked actively to collect sufficient evidence to prove the murder.

Braddon also published 'The Constitutions of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen,' and an 'Abstract of the Rules, Orders, and Constitutions' of the same company, both of them issued in 1708. 'The Miseries of the Poor are a National Sin, Shame, and Danger' was the title of a work (1717) in which he argued for the establishment of guardians of the poor and inspectors for the encouragement of arts and manufactures. Five years later he brought out 'Particular Answers to the most material Objections made to the Proposals for relieving the Poor.' The report of his trial was printed in 1684, and reprinted in '[[William Cobbett|Cobbett's]] [[State Trials]],' ix. 1127-1228, and his impeachment of Bishop Burnet's 'History' is reprinted in the same volume of Cobbett, pp.&nbsp;1229\u20131332.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Braddon, Laurence}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Braddon, Laurence}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing]]\n[[Category:1724 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Cornish writers]]\n[[Category:English politicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century English writers]]\n[[Category:18th-century male writers]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWritings:clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1127-1228 \u2192 1127\u20131228", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Braddon"}

Prefixes are used: kiloton(ne), megaton(ne), gigaton(ne), especially for expressing [[nuclear weapon yield]], based on a [[Fuel value|specific combustion energy]] of TNT of about 4.2&#160;[[megajoule|MJ]]/[[kilogram|kg]] (or one [[calorie|thermochemical calorie]] per [[milligram]]).  Hence, 1 t TNT = approx. 4.2&#160;[[Gigajoule|GJ]], 1 [[kiloton|kt]] TNT = approx. 4.2&#160;[[Terajoule|TJ]], 1&#160;Mt TNT = approx. 4.2&#160;[[Petajoule|PJ]].\n\nThe SI unit of energy is the [[joule]]. Assuming that a TNT explosion releases 1,000 small (thermochemical) [[calorie]]s per gram (approx. 4.2&nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/g), one tonne of TNT is approx. equivalent to 4.2 [[Joule|gigajoules]].\n\nIn the [[petroleum industry]] the [[tonne of oil equivalent]] (toe) is a [[units of energy|unit of energy]]: the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of [[crude oil]], approx, 42&nbsp;GJ.  There are several slightly different definitions.  This is ten times as much as a tonne of TNT because atmospheric oxygen is used.\n\n===Unit of force===\nLike the [[gram]] and the kilogram, the tonne gave rise to a (now obsolete) force unit of the same name, the tonne-force, equivalent to about 9.8 kilonewtons: a unit also often called simply \"tonne\" or \"metric ton\" without identifying it as a unit of force.  In contrast to the tonne as a mass unit, the tonne-force or metric ton-force is not acceptable for use with SI, partly because it is not an exact multiple of the SI unit of force, the [[newton (unit)|newton]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ton]]\n** [[Short ton]]\n** [[Long ton]]\n** [[Tonnage]]\n** [[Ton (volume)]]\n* [[Metre\u2013tonne\u2013second system of units]]\n* [[Tonne of oil equivalent]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (mass)]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*NIST Special Publication 811, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100216211152/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/ ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)'']\n\n{{SI units}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Non-SI metric units]]\n[[Category:Units of mass]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the metric unit of mass|other ton units|Ton|other uses of tonne|Tonne (disambiguation)|other uses of \"megagram\"|Megagram (geometry)}}\n{{Redirect|Gigatons|the album by Pearl Jam|Gigaton}}\n{{short description|Metric unit of mass equivalent to 1,000 kilograms}}\n{{Infobox unit\n| bgcolor = \n| name = Tonne\n| image = Illustration of One Tonne 2018.07.06.png\n| caption =  One tonne is equal to 1000 kilograms or 1 megagram\n| standard = [[International System of Units#Non-SI units accepted for use with SI|Non-SI unit accepted for use with SI]]\n| quantity = Mass\n| symbol = t\n| extralabel = In [[SI base unit]]s:\n| extradata = 1 t = 1000 kg = 1 Mg\n}}\nThe '''tonne''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-tonne.ogg|t|\u028c|n}} or {{IPAc-en|t|\u0252|n}}; symbol:&nbsp;'''t''') is a [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|non-SI]] [[metric units|metric unit]] of [[mass]] equal to 1,000&nbsp;[[kilogram]]s.<ref name=\"si2019\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf\n|title=The International System of Units (SI), 9th edition\n|date=2019\n|page=145\n|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref> It is commonly referred to as a '''metric ton''' in the United States.<ref name=\"FR1998\">{{cite journal|title=Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States|journal=[[Federal Register]]|date=July 28, 1998|volume=63|issue=144|id=63 FR 40333|page=40338|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/SIFedReg.pdf|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015081850/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/SIFedReg.pdf|archivedate=October 15, 2011}}</ref> It is equivalent to approximately {{nowrap|2,204.6}} [[international avoirdupois pound|pounds]],<ref name=NGS>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf|author=United States National Bureau of Standards|title=Notices \"Refinement of values for the yard and the pound\"|date=1959-06-25|accessdate=2006-08-12}}</ref> {{nowrap|1.102 [[short ton]]s (US)}} or approximately 0.984 [[long ton]]s (UK).

Prefixes are used: kiloton(ne), megaton(ne), gigaton(ne), especially for expressing [[nuclear weapon yield]], based on a [[Fuel value|specific combustion energy]] of TNT of about 4.2&#160;[[megajoule|MJ]]/[[kilogram|kg]] (or one [[calorie|thermochemical calorie]] per [[milligram]]).  Hence, 1 t TNT = approx. 4.2&#160;[[Gigajoule|GJ]], 1 [[kiloton|kt]] TNT = approx. 4.2&#160;[[Terajoule|TJ]], 1&#160;Mt TNT = approx. 4.2&#160;[[Petajoule|PJ]].\n\nThe SI unit of energy is the [[joule]]. Assuming that a TNT explosion releases 1,000 small (thermochemical) [[calorie]]s per gram (approx. 4.2&nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/g), one tonne of TNT is approx. equivalent to 4.2 [[Joule|gigajoules]].\n\nIn the [[petroleum industry]] the [[tonne of oil equivalent]] (toe) is a [[units of energy|unit of energy]]: the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of [[crude oil]], approx, 42&nbsp;GJ.  There are several slightly different definitions.  This is ten times as much as a tonne of TNT because atmospheric oxygen is used.\n\n===Unit of force===\nLike the [[gram]] and the kilogram, the tonne gave rise to a (now obsolete) force unit of the same name, the tonne-force, equivalent to about 9.8 kilonewtons: a unit also often called simply \"tonne\" or \"metric ton\" without identifying it as a unit of force.  In contrast to the tonne as a mass unit, the tonne-force or metric ton-force is not acceptable for use with SI, partly because it is not an exact multiple of the SI unit of force, the [[newton (unit)|newton]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ton]]\n** [[Short ton]]\n** [[Long ton]]\n** [[Tonnage]]\n** [[Ton (volume)]]\n* [[Metre\u2013tonne\u2013second system of units]]\n* [[Tonne of oil equivalent]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (mass)]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*NIST Special Publication 811, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100216211152/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/ ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)'']\n\n{{SI units}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Non-SI metric units]]\n[[Category:Units of mass]]\n", "name_user": "Getsnoopy", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed some formatting issues.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"}
