{"title_page": "1911 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1911 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the second full organised club season in Auckland following the [[1910 Auckland Rugby League season]]. [[City Rovers]] won the title again after winning it in the competitions inaugural year.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1910 Auckland Rugby League season|1910]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=3rd [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=\t1911}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\nThe club season commenced on 20 May, with the start of the competition for the Myers Cup. [[City Rovers]] were crowned champions after defeating [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] in the final 36-15 which was required due to both teams being within 2 points of each other as the competition entered its closing stages. The competition at the time and for decades to come often did not complete full round robins. When a team had an unassailable lead over their nearest rivals the competition was often concluded at that point. Ponsonby and City had already met twice during the season but rather than conclude the round robin with round 10. In round 10 Ponsonby would have had a bye and City would likely have gained an easy win over wooden spooners, Eden Ramblers so the Auckland Rugby League decided to have the two top teams play off for the title a week early rather than prolong the competition.\n\nThe City side featured [[Albert Asher]], [[Alex Stanaway]], [[Jim Rukutai]], and [[Bob Mitchell (rugby league)|Bob Mitchell]], while Ponsonby had [[Charlie Savory]], [[Charles Dunning (rugby)|Charles Dunning]] and [[Arthur Carlaw]].\n\n===Venues===\nUnlike in 1910 when only two venues were used, there were 5 venues used. They were [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]], Takapuna Racecourse, 'Avondale', [[Auckland Domain]], and [[Eden Park]] (which was the venue for the club final between [[City Rovers]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]].\n\n===Eden Ramblers Formed===\nThe senior competition saw the addition of the Eden Ramblers who had been formed in April. A meeting was held at the Avondale Public Hall on Wednesday 26 April with Mr [[John Bollard (politician)|John Bollard, MP]] presiding over it. He was elected president and chairman, and the name Eden Ramblers was chosen along with the colours or green and gold. The following officers were selected: Hon Secretary, Mr B Boone; Management Committee, W. A. Cummings, J Eddoes, W Fairweather, M Morrow, and J Denyer. The membership was close to 50 and they were to begin their training for the season ahead on 29 April with a join practice with Ponsonby at Victoria Park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Eden Ramblers Club\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVIII| issue=14666\n| date = 1911-04-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19110428.2.10\n| accessdate = 2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Representative Season===\nIt featured a representative program in August and September where [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] played eight matches including two against the New Zealand side. They won seven and lost one. Their first match saw them lose to [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] however they rattled off consecutive wins against New Zealand (6 weeks later), [[Wellington rugby league

seasons]]\n[[Category:1911 in New Zealand rugby league|Auckland Rugby League]]\n", "text_old": "The 1911 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the second full organised club season in Auckland following the [[1910 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1910 Auckland Rugby League season|1910]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=3rd [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=\t1911}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\nThe club season commenced on 20 May, with the start of the competition for the Myers Cup. [[City Rovers]] were crowned champions after defeating [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] in the final 36-15 which was required due to both teams being within 2 points of each other as the competition entered its closing stages. The competition at the time and for decades to come often did not complete full round robins. When a team had an unassailable lead over their nearest rivals the competition was often concluded at that point. Ponsonby and City had already met twice during the season but rather than conclude the round robin with round 10. In round 10 Ponsonby would have had a bye and City would likely have gained an easy win over wooden spooners, Eden Ramblers so the Auckland Rugby League decided to have the two top teams play off for the title a week early rather than prolong the competition.\n\nThe City side featured [[Albert Asher]], [[Alex Stanaway]], [[Jim Rukutai]], and [[Bob Mitchell (rugby league)|Bob Mitchell]], while Ponsonby had [[Charlie Savory]], [[Charles Dunning (rugby)|Charles Dunning]] and [[Arthur Carlaw]].\n\n===Venues===\nUnlike in 1910 when only two venues were used, there were 5 venues used. They were [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]], Takapuna Racecourse, 'Avondale', [[Auckland Domain]], and [[Eden Park]] (which was the venue for the club final between [[City Rovers]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]].\n\n===Eden Ramblers Formed===\nThe senior competition saw the addition of the Eden Ramblers who had been formed in April. A meeting was held at the Avondale Public Hall on Wednesday 26 April with Mr [[John Bollard (politician)|John Bollard, MP]] presiding over it. He was elected president and chairman, and the name Eden Ramblers was chosen along with the colours or green and gold. The following officers were selected: Hon Secretary, Mr B Boone; Management Committee, W. A. Cummings, J Eddoes, W Fairweather, M Morrow, and J Denyer. The membership was close to 50 and they were to begin their training for the season ahead on 29 April with a join practice with Ponsonby at Victoria Park.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Eden Ramblers Club\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=XLVIII| issue=14666\n| date = 1911-04-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19110428.2.10\n| accessdate = 2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Representative Season===\nIt featured a representative program in August and September where [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] played eight matches including two against the New Zealand side. They won seven and lost one. Their first match saw them lose to [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] however they rattled off consecutive wins against New Zealand (6 weeks later), [[Wellington rugby league team|Wellington]], Lower Waikato, [[Hawke's Bay rugby league team|Hawke's Bay]], Nelson, [[Taranaki rugby league team|Taranaki]], and Hawke's Bay M\u0101ori.\n\n==Myers Cup (First Grade Championship)==\nEighteen regular season matches were played before the final on 16 September where [[City Rovers]] defeated [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] 36 to 15 to retain the title which they had won in 1910.\n\n===Final Standings===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20

They are divided into three roughly geographic groups:\n\n*the western ''[[Mbenga people|Bambenga]]'', or ''Mbenga'' ([[Cameroon]], [[Gabon]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Central African Republic]]),\n*the eastern ''[[Bambuti]]'', or ''Mbuti'', of the [[Congo basin]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]])\n*the central and southern ''[[Batwa]]'', or ''Twa'' ([[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]]). The more widely scattered (and more variable in physiology and lifestyle) [[Southern Twa]] are also grouped under the term '''Pygmoid'''.\n\nThey are notable for, and named for, their [[short stature]] (described as \"[[pygmyism]]\" in anthropological literature). They are assumed to be descended from the original [[Middle Stone Age]] expansion of [[anatomically modern human]]s to Central Africa, albeit substantially affected by later migrations from West Africa, from their first appearance in the historical record in the 19th century limited to a comparative small area within Central Africa, greatly decimated by the prehistoric [[Bantu expansion]], and to the present time widely affected by [[Slavery in Africa|enslavement]] and [[cannibalism in Africa|cannibalism]] at the hands of neighboring [[Bantu people|Bantu]] groups.<ref name=slavery/>\n\nMost contemporary Pygmy groups are only partially foragers and partially trade with neighbouring farmers to acquire cultivated foods and other material items; no group lives deep in the forest without access to agricultural products.<ref name=focus/> A total number of about 900,000 Pygmies were estimated to be living in the central African forests in 2016, about 60% of this number in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144499 |pmid=26735953 |pmc=4711706 |title=Distribution and Numbers of Pygmies in Central African Forests |journal=PLOS One |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=e0144499 |year=2016 |last1=Olivero |first1=Jes\u00fas |last2=Fa |first2=John E |last3=Farf\u00e1n |first3=Miguel A |last4=Lewis |first4=Jerome |last5=Hewlett |first5=Barry |last6=Breuer |first6=Thomas |last7=Carpaneto |first7=Giuseppe M |last8=Fern\u00e1ndez |first8=Mar\u00eda |last9=Germi |first9=Francesco |last10=Hattori |first10=Shiho |last11=Head |first11=Josephine |last12=Ichikawa |first12=Mitsuo |last13=Kitanaishi |first13=Koichi |last14=Knights |first14=Jessica |last15=Matsuura |first15=Naoki |last16=Migliano |first16=Andrea |last17=Nese |first17=Barbara |last18=Noss |first18=Andrew |last19=Ekoumou |first19=Dieudonn\u00e9 Ongbwa |last20=Paulin |first20=Pascale |last21=Real |first21=Raimundo |last22=Riddell |first22=Mike |last23=Stevenson |first23=Edward G.

However, the term was used diffusely, and treated as unsubstantiated claims of \"dwarf tribes\" among the [[Bushmen]] of the interior of Africa, until the [[exploration of the Congo basin]] of the 1870s. A commentator writing in 1892 claimed that, thirty years ago (viz., in the 1860s), \"nobody believed in the existence of African dwarf tribes\" and that \"it needed an authority like Dr. Schweinfurth to prove that pygmies actually exist in Africa\" (referencing [[Georg August Schweinfurth]]'s ''The Heart of Africa'', published 1873).<ref>Schlichter, Henry. 1892.

Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with [[honey harvesting]], or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western Pygmy groups. This substrate has been suggested as representing a remnant of an ancient \"western Pygmy\" linguistic phylum, dubbed \"Mbenga\" or \"Baaka\". However, as substrate vocabulary has been widely borrowed between Pygmies and neighboring peoples, no reconstruction of such a \"Baaka\" language is possible for times more remote than a few centuries ago.<ref name=Bahuchet>Bahuchet, Serge (1993) \"History of the inhabitants of the central African rain forest: perspectives from comparative linguistics.\" In C.M.

It is generally accepted that their small body size is a result of genetic adaptation; however, which genes were selected, and the nature of the underlying selective force(s), remain unknown. The various hypotheses proposed include adaptations to food limitation, thermoregulation, mobility in the forest, and/or short lifespan. A recent study of the HGDP-CEPH populations identified a signal of selection in the insulin growth factor signalling pathway in Biaka Pygmies, which might be associated with short stature, but this signal was not shared with Mbuti Pygmies. By contrast, '''we found strong signals for selection in both African Pygmy groups at two genes involved in the iodide-dependent thyroid hormone pathway: TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies; and IYD in Biaka Pygmies''' (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, a previous study found a significantly lower frequency of goiter in Efe Pygmies (9.4%) than in Lese Bantu farmers (42.9%). The Efe and Lese live in close proximity to one another in the iodine-deficient Ituri Forest and share similar diets. Moreover, the frequency of goiter in Efe women living in Bantu villages was similar to that of Efe women living in the forest, and the frequency of goiter in offspring with an Efe mother and a Lese father was intermediate between that of Efe and Lese.''' These observations suggest that the Efe have adapted genetically to an iodine-deficient diet'''; we suggest that the signals of recent positive selection that we observe at TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies and IYD in Biaka Pygmies may reflect such genetic adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet. '''Furthermore, alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway can cause short stature. We therefore suggest that short stature in these Pygmy groups may have arisen as a consequence of genetic alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway.''' If this scenario is true, then there are two important implications. First, this would suggest that short stature was not selected for directly in the ancestors of Pygmy groups, but rather arose as an indirect consequence of selection in response to an iodine-deficient diet. Second, since different genes in the thyroid hormone pathway show signals of selection in Mbuti vs. Biaka Pygmies, this would suggest that short stature arose independently in the ancestors of Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies, and not in a common ancestral population. '''Moreover, most Pygmy-like groups around the world dwell in tropical forests, and hence are likely to have iodine-deficient diets. The possibility that independent adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet might therefore have contributed to the convergent evolution of the short stature phenotype in Pygmy-like groups around the world deserves further investigation.'''<ref>{{Cite journal\n|vauthors=Price AL, Tandon A, Patterson N, Barnes KC, Rafaels N, Ruczinski I, Beaty TH, Mathias R, Reich D, Myers S | title = Sensitive Detection of Chromosomal Segments of Distinct Ancestry in Admixed Populations\n| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000519\n| journal = PLOS Genetics\n| volume = 5\n| issue = 6\n| pages = e1000519\n| year = 2009\n| pmid = 19543370\n| pmc = 2689842\n}}</ref>}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Pygmy music}}\n[[File:Africa Speaks!

The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master's whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all.

One early example was the capture of Pygmy children under the auspices of the Belgian colonial authorities, who exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world's fair in the United States in 1907.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/>\n\nPygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not considered citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive [[deforestation]] have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished, and abused by the dominant culture.\n\n[[File:Living on the rainforest 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Aka people|Aka Pygmies]] living in the [[Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve]] in Central African Republic]]\nThere are roughly 500,000 Pygmies left in the rain-forest of Central Africa.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> This population is rapidly decreasing as poverty, intermarriage with Bantu peoples, Westernization, and deforestation gradually destroy their way of life and culture along with their [[Racial hygiene|genetic uniqueness]].\n\nThe greatest environmental problem the Pygmies face is the loss of their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to profit from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.\n\nAlong with Raja Sheshardi, the fPcN-Global.org website had conducted research on the pygmies. The human rights organization states that as the forest has receded under logging activities, its original inhabitants have been pushed into populated areas to join the formal economy, working as casual laborers or on commercial farms and being exposed to new diseases.<ref name=\"fpcn-global.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516034223/http://www.fpcn-global.org/node/227 Deforestation in central Africa brings HIV/AIDS to indigenous communities, mainly women]. fpcn-global.org. April 6, 2008</ref> This shift has brought them into closer contact with neighboring ethnic communities whose HIV levels are generally higher. This has led to the spread of HIV/AIDS into the pygmy group.\n\nSince poverty has become very prevalent in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. Commercial sex has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up in close contact with the Pygmy communities.\n\nHuman rights groups have also reported widespread sexual abuse of indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ohenjo | first1 = N.

Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with [[honey harvesting]], or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western Pygmy groups. This substrate has been suggested as representing a remnant of an ancient \"western Pygmy\" linguistic phylum, dubbed \"Mbenga\" or \"Baaka\". However, as substrate vocabulary has been widely borrowed between Pygmies and neighboring peoples, no reconstruction of such a \"Baaka\" language is possible for times more remote than a few centuries ago.<ref name=Bahuchet>Bahuchet, Serge (1993) \"History of the inhabitants of the central African rain forest: perspectives from comparative linguistics.\" In C.M.

It is generally accepted that their small body size is a result of genetic adaptation; however, which genes were selected, and the nature of the underlying selective force(s), remain unknown. The various hypotheses proposed include adaptations to food limitation, thermoregulation, mobility in the forest, and/or short lifespan. A recent study of the HGDP-CEPH populations identified a signal of selection in the insulin growth factor signalling pathway in Biaka Pygmies, which might be associated with short stature, but this signal was not shared with Mbuti Pygmies. By contrast, '''we found strong signals for selection in both African Pygmy groups at two genes involved in the iodide-dependent thyroid hormone pathway: TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies; and IYD in Biaka Pygmies''' (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, a previous study found a significantly lower frequency of goiter in Efe Pygmies (9.4%) than in Lese Bantu farmers (42.9%). The Efe and Lese live in close proximity to one another in the iodine-deficient Ituri Forest and share similar diets. Moreover, the frequency of goiter in Efe women living in Bantu villages was similar to that of Efe women living in the forest, and the frequency of goiter in offspring with an Efe mother and a Lese father was intermediate between that of Efe and Lese.''' These observations suggest that the Efe have adapted genetically to an iodine-deficient diet'''; we suggest that the signals of recent positive selection that we observe at TRIP4 in Mbuti Pygmies and IYD in Biaka Pygmies may reflect such genetic adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet. '''Furthermore, alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway can cause short stature. We therefore suggest that short stature in these Pygmy groups may have arisen as a consequence of genetic alterations in the thyroid hormone pathway.''' If this scenario is true, then there are two important implications. First, this would suggest that short stature was not selected for directly in the ancestors of Pygmy groups, but rather arose as an indirect consequence of selection in response to an iodine-deficient diet. Second, since different genes in the thyroid hormone pathway show signals of selection in Mbuti vs. Biaka Pygmies, this would suggest that short stature arose independently in the ancestors of Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies, and not in a common ancestral population. '''Moreover, most Pygmy-like groups around the world dwell in tropical forests, and hence are likely to have iodine-deficient diets. The possibility that independent adaptations to an iodine-deficient diet might therefore have contributed to the convergent evolution of the short stature phenotype in Pygmy-like groups around the world deserves further investigation.'''<ref>{{Cite journal\n|vauthors=Price AL, Tandon A, Patterson N, Barnes KC, Rafaels N, Ruczinski I, Beaty TH, Mathias R, Reich D, Myers S | title = Sensitive Detection of Chromosomal Segments of Distinct Ancestry in Admixed Populations\n| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000519\n| journal = PLOS Genetics\n| volume = 5\n| issue = 6\n| pages = e1000519\n| year = 2009\n| pmid = 19543370\n| pmc = 2689842\n}}</ref>}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Pygmy music}}\n[[File:Africa Speaks!

[[Simha Arom]] says that the level of polyphonic complexity of Pygmy music was reached in Europe in the 14th century, yet Pygmy culture is unwritten and ancient, some Pygmy groups being the first known cultures in some areas of Africa.<ref>''African Rhythms'' (2003).

The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master's whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all. As a result of pressure from [[UNICEF]] and human-rights activists, a law that would grant special protections to the Pygmy people is awaiting a vote by the Congo parliament.<ref name=slavery>{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/110/story/552528.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228160138/http://newsobserver.com/110/story/552528.html |archivedate=2009-02-28 |title=Congo's Pygmies live as slaves |work=The News & Observer |first=Katie |last=Thomas |date=March 12, 2007}}\n{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/16/world/as-the-world-intrudes-pygmies-feel-endangered.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=As the World Intrudes, Pygmies Feel Endangered |author=Kristof, Nicholas D. |date=June 16, 1997 |work=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], during the [[Ituri Conflict]], Ugandan backed rebel groups were accused by the UN of [[Slavery in Africa|enslaving]] Mbutis to prospect for minerals and forage for forest food, with those returning empty handed being killed and [[human cannibalism|eaten]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/09/congo.jamesastill|title=Congo rebels are eating pygmies, UN says|author=James Astill|work=The Guardian|date=8 January 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of Mbuti pygmies, told the UN's Indigenous People's Forum that during the [[Second Congo War|Congo Civil War]], his people were hunted down and eaten as though they were game animals.

One early example was the capture of Pygmy children under the auspices of the Belgian colonial authorities, who exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world's fair in the United States in 1907.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/>\n\nPygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not considered citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive [[deforestation]] have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished, and abused by the dominant culture.\n\n[[File:Living on the rainforest 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Aka people|Aka Pygmies]] living in the [[Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve]] in Central African Republic]]\nThere are roughly 500,000 Pygmies left in the rain-forest of Central Africa.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> This population is rapidly decreasing as poverty, intermarriage with Bantu peoples, Westernization, and deforestation gradually destroy their way of life and culture along with their [[Racial hygiene|genetic uniqueness]].\n\nThe greatest environmental problem the Pygmies face is the loss of their traditional homeland, the tropical forests of Central Africa. In countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo this is due to deforestation and the desire of several governments in Central Africa to evict the Pygmies from their forest habitat in order to profit from the sale of hardwood and the resettlement of farmers onto the cleared land. In some cases, as in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this conflict is violent. Certain groups, such as the Hutus of the Interahamwe, wish to eliminate the Pygmy and take the resources of the forest as a military conquest, using the resources of the forest for military as well as economic advancement.<ref name=\"Sheshadri, Raja 2005\"/> Since the Pygmies rely on the forest for their physical as well as cultural survival, as these forests disappear, so do the Pygmy.\n\nAlong with Raja Sheshardi, the fPcN-Global.org website had conducted research on the pygmies. The human rights organization states that as the forest has receded under logging activities, its original inhabitants have been pushed into populated areas to join the formal economy, working as casual laborers or on commercial farms and being exposed to new diseases.<ref name=\"fpcn-global.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516034223/http://www.fpcn-global.org/node/227 Deforestation in central Africa brings HIV/AIDS to indigenous communities, mainly women]. fpcn-global.org. April 6, 2008</ref> This shift has brought them into closer contact with neighboring ethnic communities whose HIV levels are generally higher. This has led to the spread of HIV/AIDS into the pygmy group.\n\nSince poverty has become very prevalent in the Pygmy communities, sexual exploitation of indigenous women has become a common practice. Commercial sex has been bolstered by logging, which often places large groups of male laborers in camps which are set up in close contact with the Pygmy communities.\n\nHuman rights groups have also reported widespread sexual abuse of indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ohenjo | first1 = N.

Pygmy culture is threatened today by the forces of political and economic change. In recent times, this has manifested itself into an open conflict over the resources of the tropical rain-forest; it is a conflict that the Pygmy are losing.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}{{year needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ethnic groups of Africa]]\n*[[Peopling of Africa]]\n*[[Khoi-San]]\n*[[Congoid]]\n*[[Capoid]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|African Pygmies}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070834/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=55341 Kiss of Life for DR Congo Pygmies by Badylon Kawanda Bakiman]\n*[http://www.pygmies.org/ African Pygmies: Hunter-Gatherer Peoples of Central Africa]\n*[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/The-Pygmies-Plight.html?c=y&page=1 The Pygmies' Plight] Smithsonian Magazine, December 2008 by Paul Raffaele\n*[http://www.survival-international.org/tribes.php?tribe_id=35 Survival International: Pygmies]\n*[http://www.pygmysurvival.org/ Pygmy Survival Alliance]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305231312/http://www.wimp.com/bridgebuilding/ Undated footage of Pygmy tribe constructing a vine bridge]\n\n[[Category:African Pygmies| ]]\n", "name_user": "Crywalt", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Pygmies"}

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as \"the most troublesome of all\" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', \"the noonday demon\", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:\n\n<blockquote>He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.<ref>John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' should;-\n<blockquote>be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.<ref>''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: \"The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n\nAccording to the''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''<ref>\"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t95.e35 accidie]\"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] [[The Parson's Tale|parson]] includes acedia in his list of vices. It follows [[anger]] and [[envy]] in the list and the parson connects the three vices together: <blockquote>For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire  troubleth a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. /  Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of  Accidie, and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22120/22120-h/22120-h.htm#parsonpro|title=The Canterbury Tales. The Persones Tale \u00a7 53|website=www.gutenberg.org|accessdate=2020-04-19}}</ref>.</blockquote>\n\nIn his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with \"the sorrow of the world\" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that \"worketh death\" and contrasts it with that sorrow \"according to God\" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is \"sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good.\" It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's \"flight\" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, \"on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit.\"<ref>''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.</ref> Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].\n\nAquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted \"spiritual joy\", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, \"One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good.\"<ref>''Summa'', I, 48, 1.</ref>\n\n==Modern Revival==\nThe term acedia all but died out in common usage by the beginning of the 20th century. \"In the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary, ''accidie'' was confidently declared obsolete, with references dating from 1520 and 1730. But by the mid-twentieth century, as \"civilized\" people were contending with the genocidal horror of two world wars, ''accidie'' was back in use<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Norris, Kathleen, 1947-|title=Acedia & me : a marriage, monks, and a writer's life|date=2008|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=978-1-59448-996-9|location=New York|oclc=212847707}}</ref>.\" No longer the exclusive property of theologians, the word appears in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Ian Flemming<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\n==Signs==\n[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in [[Sopron]], Hungary.]]\nAcedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottendesertm00laur}}</ref> also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this \"temptation\"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being \"a slave from within\". She relates this to forgetfulness about \"the one thing needful\": remembrance of God.\n\n==In culture==\n*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an \"indolence of the heart\" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: \"The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''\" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.<ref name=\"Benjam\u00ednOsborne2003\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjam\u00edn|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://archive.org/details/originofgermantr0000benj_y9z7|url-access=registration|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}</ref>\n*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.<ref>H.

A non-Christian, he examines \"the noon day demons\" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.\n*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in ''[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]'' cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts & S\u00f6derstr\u00f6ms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n*The [[Manic Street Preachers]] song Of Walking Abortion, which appears on their 1994 album [[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]], refers in its lyrics to \"acedia's blackest hole\".

In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as \"the most troublesome of all\" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', \"the noonday demon\", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:\n\n<blockquote>He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.<ref>John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' should;-\n<blockquote>be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.<ref>''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: \"The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n\nAccording to the''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''<ref>\"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t95.e35 accidie]\"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] [[The Parson's Tale|parson]] includes acedia in his list of vices. It follows [[anger]] and [[envy]] in the list and the parson connects the three vices together: <blockquote>For Envye blindeth the herte of a man, and Ire  troubleth a man; and Accidie maketh him hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe. /  Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of  Accidie, and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22120/22120-h/22120-h.htm#parsonpro|title=The Canterbury Tales. The Persones Tale \u00a7 53|website=www.gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>.</blockquote>\n\nIn his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with \"the sorrow of the world\" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that \"worketh death\" and contrasts it with that sorrow \"according to God\" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is \"sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good.\" It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's \"flight\" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, \"on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit.\"<ref>''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.</ref> Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].\n\nAquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted \"spiritual joy\", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, \"One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good.\"<ref>''Summa'', I, 48, 1.</ref>\n\n==Modern Revival==\nThe term acedia all but died out in common usage by the beginning of the 20th century. \"In the 1933 Oxford English Dictionary, ''accidie'' was confidently declared obsolete, with references dating from 1520 and 1730. But by the mid-twentieth century, as \"civilized\" people were contending with the genocidal horror of two world wars, ''accidie'' was back in use<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Norris, Kathleen, 1947-|title=Acedia & me : a marriage, monks, and a writer's life|date=2008|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=978-1-59448-996-9|location=New York|oclc=212847707}}</ref>.\" No longer the exclusive property of theologians, the word appears in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Ian Flemming<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\n==Signs==\n[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in [[Sopron]], Hungary.]]\nAcedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottendesertm00laur}}</ref> also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this \"temptation\"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being \"a slave from within\". She relates this to forgetfulness about \"the one thing needful\": remembrance of God.\n\n==In culture==\n*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an \"indolence of the heart\" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: \"The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''\" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.<ref name=\"Benjam\u00ednOsborne2003\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjam\u00edn|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://archive.org/details/originofgermantr0000benj_y9z7|url-access=registration|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}</ref>\n*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.<ref>H.

A non-Christian, he examines \"the noon day demons\" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.\n*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in ''[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]'' cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts & S\u00f6derstr\u00f6ms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n*The [[Manic Street Preachers]] song Of Walking Abortion, which appears on their 1994 album [[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]], refers in its lyrics to \"acedia's blackest hole\".

The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day.

The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel.

Sawyer, an engineer and experienced sea traveller, left the ship and sent the following [[Telegram|cable]] to his wife in London: \"Thought Waratah top-heavy, landed Durban\". Sawyer later testified to the London inquiry that he had booked passage on ''Waratah'' through to Cape Town, but had decided to disembark at Durban, as he had been nervous about the behaviour of the ship during his voyage. He also claimed that he had been disturbed by visions he saw in dreams during the voyage of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" Sawyer claimed that he took these visions to be a warning to leave the ship at the earliest opportunity. In any event his decision to leave the ship at Durban saved his life.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n===Disappearance===\nThe ''Waratah'' left Durban at approximately 20:15 on 26 July with 211 passengers and crew. At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire. When darkness fell, the crew of the ''Harlow'' could see the steamer's running lights approaching, but still {{convert|10|to|12|mi|km}} behind them, when there were suddenly two bright flashes from the direction of the steamer and the lights vanished. The captain thought they were caused by explosions, but the mate of the ''Harlow'' who had also seen them, thought the flashes were brush fires on the shore (a common phenomenon in the area at that time of year). The captain agreed and did not even enter the events in the log \u2013 only when he learnt of the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' did he think the events significant.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}} Reportedly the ''Harlow'' was {{convert|180|mi|km}} from Durban.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189442/the_new_york_times/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 September 1909 |page=6 |title=Saw Steamer Blow Up. |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=24 September 1909 |title=The Loss of the Waratah. |page=12 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189605/the_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nThat same evening at around 21:30 the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}}\n\nAnother possible sighting, which was not disclosed to the Inquiry at the time, was by Edward Joe Conquer, a [[Cape Mounted Riflemen|Cape Mounted Rifleman]] who on 28 July 1909, was posted to carry out military exercises on the banks of the mouth of the [[Xora River]] along with Signaller H.Adshead. He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Search efforts==\n===Contemporary searches===\nInitially, the non-appearance of the ship did not cause alarm as it was not uncommon for ships to arrive at port days, or occasionally even weeks overdue. As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''. The ''Hermes'', near the area of the last sighting of the ''Waratah'', encountered waves so large and strong that she strained her hull and had to be placed in [[dry dock]] on her return to port.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=125|ps=}} On 10 August 1909, a cable from South Africa reached Australia, reading \"Blue Anchor vessel sighted a considerable distance out.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

She spent much of her childhood watching television and old [[Hollywood]] movies, from which she learned to impersonate her favorite actresses, such as [[Joan Bennett]] and [[Kim Novak]]. She had one half-brother, Warren Law II, from her mother's first marriage to Warren Law. Warren Law II left to serve in the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] and left Darling as the only child. Law would later deny his connection to Darling.\n\nIn a biography about Darling, Cynthia Carr reveals that Darling was \"relentlessly bullied\" in high school and dropped out at the age of 16 after a group of boys tried to lynch her.<ref name=\"pagesix.com\" />\n\nIn 1961, she signed up for a course at the DeVern School of Cosmetology in [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin, Long Island]].<ref name=Moynihan>{{cite news |last=Moynihan |first=Colin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/arts/design/25cand.html |title=From the Archives, a Portrait of a Pop-Art Muse |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 24, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> Darling later said that she \"learned about the mysteries of sex from a salesman in a local children's shoe store\" and finally revealed an inclination towards [[cross-dressing]] when her mother confronted her about local rumors, which described Darling as \"dressing as a girl\" and frequenting a local [[gay bar]] called The Hayloft.

From there, she would take the train to [[Manhattan]], often sitting across from Long Island starlet [[Joey Heatherton]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In Manhattan, she would refer to her family home at 79 First Avenue in Massapequa Park as her \"country house\", and spent time in [[Greenwich Village]], meeting people through Seymour Levy on [[Bleecker Street]].\n\nDarling met Jeremiah Newton in the summer of 1966, when Newton was on his first trip to [[Greenwich Village]] from his home in [[Flushing, Queens]]. The two became friends and roommates, living together in [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] until the time of Darling's death in 1974.<ref name=Moynihan />\n\nDarling first took the name Hope Slattery. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Darling took this name in 1963/1964 after she started going to gay bars in [[Manhattan]] and visiting a doctor on Fifth Avenue for [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone injections]]. [[Jackie Curtis]] said that Darling adopted the name from a well-known [[Off-Off-Broadway|Off Broadway]] actress named Hope Stansbury, with whom she lived for a few months in an apartment behind the [[Caffe Cino]]. [[Holly Woodlawn]] remembers that Darling's name evolved from Hope Dahl to Candy Dahl, then to Candy Cane. Jeremiah Newton said she took the name \"Candy\" out of a love for sweets. In her autobiography, Woodlawn recalled that Darling had adopted the name because a friend of hers called her \"darling\" so often that it stuck.\n\n== Warhol years ==\nBefore they met, in 1967, Darling saw [[Andy Warhol]] at The Tenth of Always, an after-hours club. Darling was with [[Jackie Curtis]], who invited Warhol to a play that she had written and directed, called ''Glamour, Glory and Gold'', starring Darling as \"Nona Noonan\" and a young [[Robert De Niro]], who played six parts in the play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mafiasecretjudge.com/DeNiro.html |title=What is the Robert DeNiro Connection? |work=For Members Only: The Story of the Mob's Secret Judge |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWarhol cast Darling in a short comedic scene in ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'' (1968) with Jackie Curtis and [[Joe Dallesandro]]. After ''Flesh'', Darling was cast in a central role in ''[[Women in Revolt]]'' (1971).\n\n''Women in Revolt'' was first shown at the first [[Filmex|Los Angeles Filmex]] as ''Sex''. It was later shown as ''Andy Warhol's Women.''\n\nThe day after the celebrity preview, a group of women carrying protest signs demonstrated outside the cinema against the film, which they thought was anti-[[Feminist movement|women's liberation]]. When Darling heard about this, she said, \"Who do these dykes think they are anyway? Well, I just hope they all read [[Vincent Canby]]'s review in today's ''[[The New York Times|Times.]]'' He said I look like a cross between [[Kim Novak]] and [[Pat Nixon]].

In 1971, she went to [[Vienna]] to make two films with director [[Werner Schroeter]]:''The Death of Maria Malibran'', and another film that was never released. Darling's attempt at breaking into mainstream movies, by campaigning for the leading role in ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (1970), led to rejection and bitterness.\n\nHer theatre credits include two Jackie Curtis plays, ''Glamour, Glory and Gold'' (1967) and ''Vain Victory: The Vicissitudes of the Damned'' (1971). ''Vain Victory'' was directed by Curtis at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in May/June 1971, and featured many other performers from Warhol's [[Warhol Factory|Factory]], including Curtis, [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Tally Brown]], [[Mario Montez]], [[Samuel Adams Green]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Francesco Scavullo]], Jay Johnson (twin brother of [[Jed Johnson (designer)|Jed Johnson]]), [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Eric Emerson]], and Warhol himself.<ref>La MaMa Archives Digital Collections.

The production was bilingual, called ''The White Whore and the Bit Player/La Estrelle y La Monja'', and directed by [[Manuel Mart\u00edn Jr.|Manuel Martin Jr]].

She spent much of her childhood watching television and old [[Hollywood]] movies, from which she learned to impersonate her favorite actresses, such as [[Joan Bennett]] and [[Kim Novak]]. She had one half-brother, Warren Law II, from her mother's first marriage to Warren Law. Warren Law II left to serve in the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] and left Darling as the only child. Law would later deny his connection to Darling.\n\nIn a biography about Darling, Cynthia Carr reveals that Darling was \"relentlessly bullied\" in high school and dropped out at the age of 16 after a group of boys tried to lynch her.<ref name=\"pagesix.com\" />\n\nIn 1961, she signed up for a course at the DeVern School of Cosmetology in [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin, Long Island]].<ref name=Moynihan>{{cite news |last=Moynihan |first=Colin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/arts/design/25cand.html |title=From the Archives, a Portrait of a Pop-Art Muse |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 24, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> Darling later said that she \"learned about the mysteries of sex from a salesman in a local children's shoe store\" and finally revealed an inclination towards [[cross-dressing]] when her mother confronted her about local rumors, which described Darling as \"dressing as a girl\" and frequenting a local [[gay bar]] called The Hayloft. In response, Darling left the room and returned in feminine clothing. Darling's mother would later say that, \"I knew then... that I couldn't stop (Candy). Candy was just too beautiful and talented.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Comenas |url=http://www.warholstars.org/stars/candy.html |title=Candy Darling |work=Warholstars.org |accessdate=November 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203013118/http://www.warholstars.org/stars/candy.html |archivedate=February 3, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter coming out publicly, Darling would take a short cab ride to the [[Long Island Rail Road]] station, avoiding the attention of neighbors she would receive by walking to the train. From there, she would take the train to [[Manhattan]], often sitting across from Long Island starlet [[Joey Heatherton]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In Manhattan, she would refer to her family home at 79 First Avenue in Massapequa Park as her \"country house\", and spent time in [[Greenwich Village]], meeting people through Seymour Levy on [[Bleecker Street]].\n\nDarling met Jeremiah Newton in the summer of 1966, when Newton was on his first trip to [[Greenwich Village]] from his home in [[Flushing, Queens]]. The two became friends and roommates, living together in [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] until the time of Darling's death in 1974.<ref name=Moynihan />\n\nDarling first took the name Hope Slattery. According to [[Bob Colacello]], Darling took this name in 1963/1964 after she started going to gay bars in [[Manhattan]] and visiting a doctor on Fifth Avenue for [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone injections]]. [[Jackie Curtis]] said that Darling adopted the name from a well-known [[Off-Off-Broadway|Off Broadway]] actress named Hope Stansbury, with whom she lived for a few months in an apartment behind the [[Caffe Cino]]. [[Holly Woodlawn]] remembers that Darling's name evolved from Hope Dahl to Candy Dahl, then to Candy Cane. Jeremiah Newton said she took the name \"Candy\" out of a love for sweets. In her autobiography, Woodlawn recalled that Darling had adopted the name because a friend of hers called her \"darling\" so often that it stuck.\n\n== Warhol years ==\nBefore they met, in 1967, Darling saw [[Andy Warhol]] at The Tenth of Always, an after-hours club. Darling was with [[Jackie Curtis]], who invited Warhol to a play that she had written and directed, called ''Glamour, Glory and Gold'', starring Darling as \"Nona Noonan\" and a young [[Robert De Niro]], who played six parts in the play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mafiasecretjudge.com/DeNiro.html |title=What is the Robert DeNiro Connection? |work=For Members Only: The Story of the Mob's Secret Judge |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nWarhol cast Darling in a short comedic scene in ''[[Flesh (1968 film)|Flesh]]'' (1968) with Jackie Curtis and [[Joe Dallesandro]]. After ''Flesh'', Darling was cast in a central role in ''[[Women in Revolt]]'' (1971).\n\n''Women in Revolt'' was first shown at the first [[Filmex|Los Angeles Filmex]] as ''Sex''. It was later shown as ''Andy Warhol's Women.''\n\nThe day after the celebrity preview, a group of women carrying protest signs demonstrated outside the cinema against the film, which they thought was anti-[[Feminist movement|women's liberation]]. When Darling heard about this, she said, \"Who do these dykes think they are anyway? Well, I just hope they all read [[Vincent Canby]]'s review in today's ''[[The New York Times|Times.]]'' He said I look like a cross between [[Kim Novak]] and [[Pat Nixon]].

In 1971, she went to [[Vienna]] to make two films with director [[Werner Schroeter]]:''The Death of Maria Malibran'', and another film that was never released. Darling's attempt at breaking into mainstream movies, by campaigning for the leading role in ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (1970), led to rejection and bitterness.\n\nHer theatre credits include two Jackie Curtis plays, ''Glamour, Glory and Gold'' (1967) and ''Vain Victory: The Vicissitudes of the Damned'' (1971). ''Vain Victory'' was directed by Curtis at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in May/June 1971, and featured many other performers from Warhol's [[Warhol Factory|Factory]], including Curtis, [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Tally Brown]], [[Mario Montez]], [[Samuel Adams Green]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Francesco Scavullo]], Jay Johnson (twin brother of [[Jed Johnson (designer)|Jed Johnson]]), [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Eric Emerson]], and Warhol himself.<ref>La MaMa Archives Digital Collections.

She starred in the 1973 revival of ''The White Whore and the Bit Player'', a 1964 play by [[Tom Eyen]], at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]]. The production was bilingual, called ''The White Whore and the Bit Player/La Estrelle y La Monja'', and directed by [[Manuel Mart\u00edn Jr.|Manuel Martin Jr]]. Darling's character, a Hollywood actress known only as \"the Whore\", was based on [[Marilyn Monroe]].
