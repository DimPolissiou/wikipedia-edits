The following year, he became the Yankees' starting shortstop, won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]], and helped push the team to win the [[1996 World Series]]. Jeter continued to play during the team's championship seasons of 1998\u20132000; he finished third in voting for the [[American League]] (AL) [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]] in 1998, recorded multiple career-high numbers in 1999, and won both the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP]] and [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series MVP Awards]] in 2000. He consistently placed among the AL leaders in hits and runs scored for most of his career, and served as the Yankees' [[captain (baseball)|team captain]] from 2003 until his retirement in 2014. Throughout his career, Jeter contributed reliably to the Yankees' franchise successes. He holds many [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] records, and has a .321&nbsp;[[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] in the World Series.

These cores are optimized for low-cost and energy-efficient microcontrollers, which have been embedded in tens of billions of consumer devices.<ref>[http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m ARM Cortex-M website; arm.com]</ref>   The cores consist of the Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M1, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, Cortex-M23, Cortex-M33, Cortex-M35P, Cortex-M55.<ref name=\"M0-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M0+-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M1-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M3-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M4-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M7-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M23-TRM\"/>  The Cortex-M4 / M7 / M33 / M35P / M55 cores have an [[Floating-point unit|FPU]] silicon option, and when included in the silicon these cores are sometimes known as \"Cortex-Mx with FPU\" or \"Cortex-MxF\", where 'x' is the core number.\n\n==Overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:9px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Announced\n|-\n!

Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

Legacy cores allowed \"on-the-fly\" changing of the data [[endianness|endian]] mode.\n* [[Coprocessor|Co-processor]] were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n\nThe capabilities of the 32-bit ARM instruction set is duplicated in many ways by the Thumb-1 and Thumb-2 instruction sets, but some ARM features don't have a similar feature:\n* The SWP and SWPB (swap) ARM instructions don't have a similar feature in Cortex-M.\n\nThe 16-bit Thumb-1 instruction set has evolved over time since it was first released in the legacy [[ARM7|ARM7T]] cores with the ARMv4T architecture.  New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.  The \"BLX <register>\" instruction is still available in the Cortex-M.\n* SETEND doesn't exist because on-the-fly switching of data endian mode is no longer supported.\n* Co-processor instructions were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n* The SWI instruction was renamed to SVC, though the instruction binary coding is the same. However, the SVC handler code is different from the SWI handler code, because of changes to the exception models.\n\n==Cortex-M0==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1]] (most),<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2]] (some)\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n\nThe Cortex-M0 core is optimized for small silicon die size and use in the lowest price chips.\n\nKey features of the Cortex-M0 core are:<ref name=\"M0-TRM\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0432c/DDI0432C_cortex_m0_r0p0_trm.pdf Cortex-M0 r0p0 Technical Reference Manual; Arm Holdings.]</ref>\n* ARMv6-M architecture<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/>\n* 3-stage [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]\n* Instruction sets:\n** Thumb-1 (most), missing CBZ, CBNZ, IT\n** Thumb-2 (some), only BL, DMB, DSB, ISB, MRS, MSR\n** 32-bit hardware integer multiply with 32-bit result\n* 1 to 32 [[interrupt]]s, plus [[non-maskable interrupt|NMI]]\n\n'''Silicon options:'''\n* Hardware integer multiply speed: 1 or 32 cycles.\n\n===Chips===\nThe following microcontrollers are based on the Cortex-M0 core:\n* ABOV Semiconductor AC30M1x64\n* [[Cypress Semiconductor|Cypress]] PSoC 4000, 4100, 4100M, 4200, 4200DS, 4200L, 4200M \n* [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] [[Infineon XMC|XMC1100]], XMC1200, XMC1300, XMC1400, TLE984x\n*[[Dialog Semiconductor]] DA1458x, DA1468x\n* [[Nordic Semiconductor|Nordic]] [[nRF51]]\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC1100]], [[LPC1200]]\n* [[Nuvoton|nuvoTon]] NuMicro M0 Family\n* Sonix SN32F700\n* [[STMicroelectronics|ST]] [[STM32#STM32 F0|STM32 F0]]\n* [[Toshiba]] TX00\n* Vorago VA10800 (extreme temperature), VA10820 (radiation hardened)\n\nThe following chips have a Cortex-M0 as a secondary core:\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC4300]] (one Cortex-M4F + one Cortex-M0)\n* [[Texas Instruments]] SimpleLink Wireless MCUs CC1310 and CC2650 (one programmable Cortex-M3 + one Cortex-M0 network processor + one proprietary Sensor Controller Engine)\n\n==Cortex-M0+==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0+\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1 (most)]],<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2 (some)]]\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n[[File:Freescale FRDM-KL25Z board with KL25Z128VLK (ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU).JPG|thumb|right| [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] ([[Freescale]]) FRDM-KL25Z Board with KL25Z128VLK (Kinetis L)]]\nThe Cortex-M0+ is an optimized superset of the Cortex-M0.

In the past, 8-bit microcontroller documentation would typically fit in a single document, but as microcontrollers have evolved, so has everything required to support them.  A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

She gained popularity by playing spirited village belle characters, but has appeared in diverse genres such as fantasy and social films. Her best performances are considered to be in the films ''Sazaa'' (1951), India\u2019s first technicolor film ''[[Aan]]'' (1952), \n''[[Uran Khatola (film)|Uran Khatola]]'' (1955), ''Bhai-Bhai'' (1956), ''Kundan'' (1955), ''[[Mere Mehboob]]'' (1963), ''[[Pooja Ke Phool]]'' (1964), ''Akashdeep'' (1965), and ''[[Basant Bahar (film)|Basant Bahar]]'' (1956). [[Raj Kapoor]] rechristened Nawab Banoo as \"Nimmi\".\n\n==Early life==\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2020}}\nNawab Banoo was born in [[Agra]] to a Muslim family. Her mother was a courtesan, a singer and an actress, known as Wahidan. She was well connected within the film industry. Nimmi's father, Abdul Hakim, worked as a military contractor. Nimmi's true forename of \"Nawab\" was given by her grandfather while her grandmother added \"Banoo\". As a young child, Nimmi had memories of visiting [[Bombay]], and her mother being on good terms with [[Mehboob Khan]] and his family, who were prominent and influential within the movie-making business.\n\nWhen Nimmi was only eleven years old, her mother died suddenly. Her father lived in [[Meerut]] where he worked and had a family; by this time, his contact with Nimmi's mother was minimal. Nimmi was therefore sent to live in [[Abbottabad]] near [[Rawalpindi]] with her maternal grandmother. The [[partition of India]] happened in 1947, and Abbotabad fell in [[Pakistan]]. Nimmi's grandmother moved to [[Mumbai]] (then known as Bombay) and settled in the household of her other daughter, known by the name Jyoti. Herself a former actress, Jyoti was married to [[G. M. Durrani]], a popular Indian playback singer, actor, and music director.\n\n==Career==\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2020}}\nIn 1948, via the connection with her mother who had worked with him in the 1930s, the famous filmmaker [[Mehboob Khan]], invited the young Nimmi to watch the making of his current production ''[[Andaz (1949 film)|Andaz]]'' at Central Studios. She had shown an interest in movies and this was an opportunity to understand the film making process. On the sets of ''Andaz'', Nimmi met [[Raj Kapoor]], who was starring in the film.\n\nAt the time [[Raj Kapoor]] was filming his production of ''[[Barsaat (1949 film)|Barsaat]]'' (1949). Having already cast the famous actress [[Nargis]] in the female lead role, he was on the lookout for a young girl to play the second lead. After observing Nimmi's unaffected and shy behaviour as a guest on the sets of ''Andaz'', he cast the teenaged Nimmi in ''Barsaat'' opposite the actor [[Prem Nath]]. Nimmi played the role of an innocent mountain shepherdess in love with a heartless city man. ''Barsaat'', released in 1949, made movie history. It was a phenomenal critical and commercial success. Despite the presence of established and popular stars [[Nargis]], [[Raj Kapoor]] and Premnath, Nimmi had a very prominent and well-received role and was an instant hit with audiences.  \n\n===Rise to stardom===\nAfter ''[[Barsaat (1949 film)|Barsaat]]'', Nimmi was flooded with film offers. She quietly polished her histrionic abilities and developed a mannered but effectively unique style of acting. The diminutive actress quickly won a loyal fan base with her intense and expressive performances.\n\n====1950s====\nShe worked with top heroes like [[Raj Kapoor]] (''[[Banwara]]''), and Dev Anand (''[[Sazaa (1951 film)|Sazaa]]'', ''[[Aandhiyan (1952 film)|Aandhiyan]]''). To her great advantage Nimmi formed a very popular and dependable screen pair with [[Dilip Kumar]], after the success of films like ''[[Deedar (1951 film)|Deedar]]'' (1951) and ''[[Daag (1952 film)|Daag]]'' (1952). Aside from [[Nargis]] with whom she co-starred  in ''Barsaat'' and ''Deedar'', Nimmi also appeared alongside many notable leading ladies including [[Madhubala]] (''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]''), [[Suraiya]] (''[[Shama (1961 film)|Shama]]''), [[Geeta Bali]] (''[[Usha Kiran (1952 film)|Usha Kiran]]''), and [[Meena Kumari]] (''[[Char Dil Char Rahen (1959)|Char Dil Char Rahen]]'' (1959). Nimmi was also a singer and sang her own songs in the film ''[[Bedardi (1951 film)|Bedardi]]'' (1951) in which she also acted. However, she never continued singing, and recorded songs only for this film.\n\n[[Mehboob Khan]] was next to cast her in ''[[Aan]]'' (1952). The film was made with an extremely large budget. Nimmi played one of the female leads. Such was Nimmi's popularity at this point that when a first edit of the film was shown to the film's financiers and distributors, they objected that Nimmi's character died too early. An extended dream sequence was added to give Nimmi more prominence and screen time in the film. ''[[Aan]]'' was one of the first Indian movies to have a worldwide release. The film had an extremely lavish [[London]] premiere which Nimmi attended. The [[English language|English]] version was entitled ''[[Savage Princess]]''. On the [[London]] trip, Nimmi met many western film personalities including [[Errol Flynn]]. When Flynn attempted to kiss her hand she pulled it away, exclaiming, \"I am an Indian girl, you cannot do that!\" The incident made the headlines and the press raved about Nimmi as the ''\"... unkissed girl of [[India]]\"''.\n\nNimmi further revealed in a 2013 interview, that at the London premiere of Aan, she received four serious offers from Hollywood, including Cecil B. DeMille who greatly admired the film and Nimmi's performance. Nimmi declined these offers, choosing to focus on her flourishing career in India. After the great box-office success of ''[[Aan]]'', [[Mehboob Khan]] asked her to appear in his next film ''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]'' (1954). Nimmi played a poor, milkmaid seduced by a lawyer ([[Dilip Kumar]]). The film also starred [[Madhubala]] as Kumar's wronged fianc\u00e9e. Its controversial subject of rape was way ahead of its time and although the film was not a commercial success, Nimmi's intense performance and the film were applauded by critics. It remained the favorite film of [[Mehboob Khan]] amongst his own productions. She acted and turned producer with the popular film ''[[Danka (1954 film)|Danka]]'' (1954) which was released under her own production banner. ''[[Kundan (1955 film)|Kundan]]'' (1955), produced by [[Sohrab Modi]] co-starring newcomer [[Sunil Dutt]], gave Nimmi a memorable double role as mother and daughter. Her sensitive portrayal earned her further recognition as a talented and spirited actress. In ''[[Uran Khatola]]'' (1955), her last of five films with [[Dilip Kumar]], she starred in one of the biggest box-office successes of her career. \n\nNimmi next had two big successes in 1956 with ''[[Basant Bahar (film)|Basant Bahar]]'' and ''[[Bhai-Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai-Bhai]]''. In 1957, at the age of 24, Nimmi received the critic's award for best actress for her role in ''[[Bhai Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai Bhai]]''. These films were also notable for her songs which were dubbed by [[Lata Mangeshkar]]. By this point, with a largely consistent run of success at the box-office, Nimmi had firmly established herself as one of the most bankable and popular leading ladies in [[Hindi]] cinema.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Nimmi worked with renowned directors [[Chetan Anand (producer & director)|Chetan Anand]] (''[[Anjali (1957 film)|Anjali]]'' ), [[K. A. Abbas]] (''[[Char Dil Char Rahen]]'') and [[Vijay Bhatt]] (''[[Angulimala]]''). Prepared to take risks, Nimmi took on controversial characterizations, such as the prostitute of ''Char Dil Char Raahen'' (1959). It was during this phase that Nimmi became very selective as she strove for better quality projects and roles. However, her judgment was sometimes questionable when she rejected films like [[B. R. Chopra]]'s ''[[Sadhna]]'' (1958), and ''[[Woh Kaun Thi?]]'' (1963), both of which went on to be big successes for [[Vyjayanthimala]] and [[Sadhana]], respectively.\n\n====Completion of Love & God====\nAt this point, Nimmi opted for early retirement and marriage, but not before investing her best efforts into one last film production. Director [[K. Asif]] had started his version of the [[Laila]]-[[Majnu]] love legend, ''[[Love & God]]'' even before completing his magnum opus ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1960). Nimmi believed that ''Love & God'' would be a fitting [[swan song]] to her career and her claim to eternal fame just as ''Mughal-e-Azam'' had immortalised its leading lady, [[Madhubala]]. K. Asif had problems casting the male lead before finally selecting [[Guru Dutt]] as Nimmi's co-star.  However, Guru Dutt's sudden and premature death put a halt to the film's shooting. [[Sanjeev Kumar]] was cast as his replacement but the film was shelved altogether when the director K. Asif died.\n\nNimmi had retired from films for over two decades by the time K. Asif's widow [[Akhtar Asif]] released ''Love & God'' on 6 June 1986 in incomplete form. The film suffers badly from compromised editing in an attempt to cover the fact that several key scenes and a clear climax were not filmed before Asif died. But the footage that Nimmi completed before the film was shelved showed she had delivered a subtle and sensitive portrayal and looked beautiful in [[Technicolor]] and the period costumes.\n\n[[File:Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Nimmi in recent years]]\nIn 2013, in a rare interview with [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted her complete Hindi film career, from her beginnings as a child in Agra, her first break in Barsaat to the current day, and her experiences during this time.<ref name=\"ht\">{{cite news |title=Guftagoo, the only uninterrupted Bollywood celebrity show on Indian television |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/guftagoo-the-only-uninterrupted-bollywood-celebrity-show-on-indian-television/story-UbEgXaEB9k6mtjvu6zFwkL.html |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=M |first1=Irfan |title=Guftagoo with Nimmi |url=http://fullreels.com/en/video/O5qe8NMuZA8/Guftagoo-with-Nimmi |website=https://rstv.nic.in/promo-guftagoo.html |publisher=Rajya Sabha TV |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Portrait Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Nimmi in 1949]]\nIn her interview with Irfan and [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted that she first saw a photo of her husband Raza, himself a scriptwriter with [[Mehboob Studio|Mehboob studios]], during a shooting at [[Famous Studios|Famous studio]]. Her hairdresser had shown her Raza's photo in the film magazine \"[[Filmindia]]\" and asked her why she did not want to marry him. She liked the idea as she had heard about Raza. Soon, her co-actor [[Mukri]] also suggested the same. They acted as cupids, subsequently, their parents met, and were married. Thus, the match was arranged by the two families in the usual Indian way. The couple was not blessed with children, and they were both deeply disappointed by this. They subsequently adopted Nimmi's sister's son, who now lives in [[London]].<ref name=\"rstvfull\">{{cite news |last1=m |first1=Irfan |title=Guftagoo with Nimmi : Complete interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5qe8NMuZA8 |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=Rajya Sabha TV |date=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 2020, she died at age 87.<ref>https://www.deccanherald.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/bollywood-actor-nimmi-no-more-817861.html</ref> <ref>https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/2020/mar/27/veteran-actor-nimmi-passes-away-at-88-2121982.html</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film\n!Role\n!Notes \n|-\n|1949\n|''[[Barsaat (1949 film)|Barsaat]]''\n|Neela\n|Debut film \n|-\n|rowspan=3|1950\n|''[[Wafaa (film)|Wafaa]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Raj Mukut]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Jalte Deep]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1951\n|''[[Sazaa (1951 film)|Sazaa]]''\n|Asha\n|\n|-\n|''[[Buzdil]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Deedar (1951 film)|Deedar]]''\n|Champa\n|\n|-\n|''Bedardi''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Badi Bahu]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1952\n|''[[Daag (1952 film)|Daag]]''\n|Parvati \"Paro\"\n|\n|-\n|''[[Aan]]''\n|Mangala\n|\n|-\n|''[[Aandhiyan (1952 film)|Aandhiyan]]''\n|Rani\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1953\n|''[[Humdard]]''\n| \n|\n|-\n|''[[Aabshar]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Alif Laila (1953 film)|Alif Laila]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=4|1954\n|''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Pyaase Nain]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''Kasturi''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''Danka''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=4|1955\n|''[[Society (1955 film)|Society]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Uran Khatola (film)|Uran Khatola]]''\n|Soni / Shibu\n|\n|-\n|''[[Kundan (film)|Kundan]]''\n|Radha\n|\n|-\n|''[[Bhagwat Mahima]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1956\n|''[[Rajdhani (film)|Rajdhani]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Bhai-Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai-Bhai]]''\n|Rani\n|\n|-\n|''[[Basant Bahar (film)|Basant Bahar]]''\n|Gopi\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1957\n|''[[Anjali (1957 film)|Anjali]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Chotte Babu]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|1958\n|''[[Sohni Mahiwal (1958 film)|Sohni Mahiwal]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1959\n|''[[Pehli Raat (film)|Pehli Raat]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Char Dil Char Rahen]]''\n|Pyari\n|\n|-\n|1960\n|''[[Angulimaal (film)|Angulimaal]]''\n|Princess Maya\n|\n|-\n|1961\n|''[[Shamma]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|1963\n|''[[Mere Mehboob]]''\n|Najma, Anwar's sister\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1964\n|''[[Pooja Ke Phool]]''\n|Gauri\n|\n|-\n|''[[Daal Me Kala]]''\n|Manju\n|\n|-\n|1965\n|''[[Akashdeep]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[Love & God]]''\n|Laila\n|Starting production in 1963, the film was released in 1986.\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Interview, ''Nimmi: \"I have a dream to be Queen\"'', [[The Indian Express]] Newspaper, Issue date: Friday, 30 May 1997.

However, she never continued singing, and recorded songs only for this film.\n\n[[Mehboob Khan]] was next to cast her in ''[[Aan]]'' (1952). The film was made with an extremely large budget. Nimmi played one of the female leads. Such was Nimmi's popularity at this point that when a first edit of the film was shown to the film's financiers and distributors, they objected that Nimmi's character died too early. An extended dream sequence was added to give Nimmi more prominence and screen time in the film. ''[[Aan]]'' was one of the first Indian movies to have a worldwide release. The film had an extremely lavish [[London]] premiere which Nimmi attended. The [[English language|English]] version was entitled ''[[Savage Princess]]''. On the [[London]] trip, Nimmi met many western film personalities including [[Errol Flynn]]. When Flynn attempted to kiss her hand she pulled it away, exclaiming, \"I am an Indian girl, you cannot do that!\" The incident made the headlines and the press raved about Nimmi as the ''\"... unkissed girl of [[India]]\"''.\n\nNimmi further revealed in a 2013 interview, that at the London premiere of Aan, she received four serious offers from Hollywood, including Cecil B. DeMille who greatly admired the film and Nimmi's performance. Nimmi declined these offers, choosing to focus on her flourishing career in India. After the great box-office success of ''[[Aan]]'', [[Mehboob Khan]] asked her to appear in his next film ''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]'' (1954). Nimmi played a poor, milkmaid seduced by a lawyer ([[Dilip Kumar]]). The film also starred [[Madhubala]] as Kumar's wronged fianc\u00e9e. Its controversial subject of rape was way ahead of its time and although the film was not a commercial success, Nimmi's intense performance and the film were applauded by critics. It remained the favorite film of [[Mehboob Khan]] amongst his own productions. She acted and turned producer with the popular film ''[[Danka (1954 film)|Danka]]'' (1954) which was released under her own production banner. ''[[Kundan (1955 film)|Kundan]]'' (1955), produced by [[Sohrab Modi]] co-starring newcomer [[Sunil Dutt]], gave Nimmi a memorable double role as mother and daughter. Her sensitive portrayal earned her further recognition as a talented and spirited actress. In ''[[Uran Khatola]]'' (1955), her last of five films with [[Dilip Kumar]], she starred in one of the biggest box-office successes of her career. \n\nNimmi next had two big successes in 1956 with ''[[Basant Bahar (film)|Basant Bahar]]'' and ''[[Bhai-Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai-Bhai]]''. In 1957, at the age of 24, Nimmi received the critic's award for best actress for her role in ''[[Bhai Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai Bhai]]''. These films were also notable for her songs which were dubbed by [[Lata Mangeshkar]]. By this point, with a largely consistent run of success at the box-office, Nimmi had firmly established herself as one of the most bankable and popular leading ladies in [[Hindi]] cinema.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Nimmi worked with renowned directors [[Chetan Anand (producer & director)|Chetan Anand]] (''[[Anjali (1957 film)|Anjali]]'' ), [[K. A. Abbas]] (''[[Char Dil Char Rahen]]'') and [[Vijay Bhatt]] (''[[Angulimala]]''). Prepared to take risks, Nimmi took on controversial characterizations, such as the prostitute of ''Char Dil Char Raahen'' (1959). It was during this phase that Nimmi became very selective as she strove for better quality projects and roles. However, her judgment was sometimes questionable when she rejected films like [[B. R. Chopra]]'s ''[[Sadhna]]'' (1958), and ''[[Woh Kaun Thi?]]'' (1963), both of which went on to be big successes for [[Vyjayanthimala]] and [[Sadhana]], respectively.\n\n====Completion of Love & God====\nAt this point, Nimmi opted for early retirement and marriage, but not before investing her best efforts into one last film production. Director [[K. Asif]] had started his version of the [[Laila]]-[[Majnu]] love legend, ''[[Love & God]]'' even before completing his magnum opus ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1960). Nimmi believed that ''Love & God'' would be a fitting [[swan song]] to her career and her claim to eternal fame just as ''Mughal-e-Azam'' had immortalised its leading lady, [[Madhubala]]. K. Asif had problems casting the male lead before finally selecting [[Guru Dutt]] as Nimmi's co-star.  However, Guru Dutt's sudden and premature death put a halt to the film's shooting. [[Sanjeev Kumar]] was cast as his replacement but the film was shelved altogether when the director K. Asif died.\n\nNimmi had retired from films for over two decades by the time K. Asif's widow [[Akhtar Asif]] released ''Love & God'' on 6 June 1986 in incomplete form. The film suffers badly from compromised editing in an attempt to cover the fact that several key scenes and a clear climax were not filmed before Asif died. But the footage that Nimmi completed before the film was shelved showed she had delivered a subtle and sensitive portrayal and looked beautiful in [[Technicolor]] and the period costumes.\n\n[[File:Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Nimmi in recent years]]\nIn 2013, in a rare interview with [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted her complete Hindi film career, from her beginnings as a child in Agra, her first break in Barsaat to the current day, and her experiences during this time.<ref name=\"ht\">{{cite news |title=Guftagoo, the only uninterrupted Bollywood celebrity show on Indian television |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/guftagoo-the-only-uninterrupted-bollywood-celebrity-show-on-indian-television/story-UbEgXaEB9k6mtjvu6zFwkL.html |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=M |first1=Irfan |title=Guftagoo with Nimmi |url=http://fullreels.com/en/video/O5qe8NMuZA8/Guftagoo-with-Nimmi |website=https://rstv.nic.in/promo-guftagoo.html |publisher=Rajya Sabha TV |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Portrait Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Nimmi in 1949]]\nIn her interview with Irfan and [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted that she first saw a photo of her husband Raza, himself a scriptwriter with [[Mehboob Studio|Mehboob studios]], during a shooting at [[Famous Studios|Famous studio]].

Soon, her co-actor [[Mukri]] also suggested the same. They acted as cupids, subsequently, their parents met, and were married. Thus, the match was arranged by the two families in the usual Indian way. The couple was not blessed with children, and they were both deeply disappointed by this.

Both words are used interchangeably in southern [[Louisiana]]. Some people call the monster ''rougarou''; others refer to it as the ''loup-garou''.\n\nThe rougarou legend has been spread for many generations, either directly from French settlers to [[Louisiana (New France)]] or via the [[French Canadian]] immigrants centuries ago.\n\nIn the [[Cajun]] legends, the creature is said to prowl the swamps around [[Acadiana]] and [[Greater New Orleans]], and the sugar cane fields and woodlands of the regions{{citation needed|reason=This claim is unsourced|date=June 2016}}. The rougarou most often is described as a creature with a human body and the head of a wolf or dog, similar to the werewolf legend.\n\nOften the story-telling has been used to inspire fear and obedience. One such example is stories that have been told by elders to persuade Cajun children to behave. According to another variation, the wolf-like beast will hunt down and kill [[Catholic]]s who do not follow the rules of [[Lent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pelicanstateofmind.com/louisiana-love/history-rougarou-louisiana-werewolf/|title=History of the Rougarou: Louisiana\u2019s Werewolf {{!}} Pelican State of Mind|website=pelicanstateofmind.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref> This coincides with the French Catholic loup-garou stories, according to which the method for turning into a werewolf is to break Lent seven years in a row{{citation needed|reason=This claim is unsourced|date=June 2016}}.\n\nA common [[Hematophagy|blood sucking]] legend says that the rougarou is under the spell for 101 days.

Both words are used interchangeably in southern [[Louisiana]]. Some people call the monster ''rougarou''; others refer to it as the ''loup-garou''.\n\nThe rougarou legend has been spread for many generations, either directly from French settlers to [[Louisiana (New France)]] or via the [[French Canadian]] immigrants centuries ago.\n\nIn the [[Cajun]] legends, the creature is said to prowl the swamps around [[Acadiana]] and [[Greater New Orleans]], and the sugar cane fields and woodlands of the regions{{citation needed|reason=This claim is unsourced|date=June 2016}}. The rougarou most often is described as a creature with a human body and the head of a wolf or dog, similar to the werewolf legend.\n\nOften the story-telling has been used to inspire fear and obedience. One such example is stories that have been told by elders to persuade Cajun children to behave. According to another variation, the wolf-like beast will hunt down and kill [[Catholic]]s who do not follow the rules of [[Lent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pelicanstateofmind.com/louisiana-love/history-rougarou-louisiana-werewolf/|title=History of the Rougarou: Louisiana\u2019s Werewolf {{!}} Pelican State of Mind|website=pelicanstateofmind.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref> This coincides with the French Catholic loup-garou stories, according to which the method for turning into a werewolf is to break Lent seven years in a row{{citation needed|reason=This claim is unsourced|date=June 2016}}.\n\nA common [[Hematophagy|blood sucking]] legend says that the rougarou is under the spell for 101 days. After that time, the curse is transferred from person to person when the rougarou draws another human's blood. During that day the creature returns to human form. Although acting sickly, the human refrains from telling others of the situation for fear of being killed.<ref>\n[http://www.thenichollsworth.com/media/paper262/news/2001/04/26/Lagniappe/He.Creeps.He.Crawls.He.Conquers-73232.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomain=www.thenichollsworth.com The Nicholls Worth; interview with Barry Ancelet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927152810/http://www.thenichollsworth.com/media/paper262/news/2001/04/26/Lagniappe/He.Creeps.He.Crawls.He.Conquers-73232.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomain=www.thenichollsworth.com |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nOther stories range from the rougarou as a rabbit to the rougarou being derived from [[witchcraft]].

[[P\u0101li Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] ''dhy\u0101na'' / [Pali:] ''jh\u0101na'') or \"concentrations\" (''[[sam\u0101dhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)}} and ''[[vipassana]]''.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&nbsp;\u2013 across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Therav\u0101da]] tradition, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.{{refn|group=note|Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&nbsp;\u2013 and by whatever name&nbsp;\u2013 are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s\" (p. 227).}} Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.{{refn|group=note|Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, [[Nyanaponika]] (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).}}\n\nAccording to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial traditions, and the Tibetan tradition,<ref name=\"Ray2004\">Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']</ref> the Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).<ref>These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269\u201370, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].</ref>\n\nThrough the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]]) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions.<ref name=\"Ray2004\"/> In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.<ref>See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267\u201368, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].

This is because magic is often thought to require a particular state of mind in order to make contact with spirits, or because one has to visualize one's goal or otherwise keep intent focused for a long period during the ritual in order to see the desired outcome. Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Modern spirituality===\n[[File:Jawlensky Meditation 1290065.jpg|thumb|upright|''Meditation''.

Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|awakening]] and [[nirvana]].{{refn|group=note|For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation \"includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim.\" Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: \"To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]....\" A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: \"'''Meditation'''&nbsp;\u2013 general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'\" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are \"of a more preparatory nature\" (p. 4).}} The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bh\u0101van\u0101]]'',{{refn|group=note|The [[P\u0101li]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bh\u0101van\u0101'' literally means \"development\" as in \"mental development.\" For the association of this term with \"meditation,\" see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in \"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nassati\u1e43, r\u0101hula, bh\u0101vana\u1e43 bh\u0101vehi.}}'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: \"Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bh\u0101vana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&-out breathing]].\" (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)}} ''jh\u0101na''/''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]'',{{refn|group=note|See, for example, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word \"zen\" from [[Sanskrit]] \"dhy\u0101na\". [[P\u0101li Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] ''dhy\u0101na'' / [Pali:] ''jh\u0101na'') or \"concentrations\" (''[[sam\u0101dhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)}} and ''[[vipassana]]''.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&nbsp;\u2013 across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Therav\u0101da]] tradition, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.{{refn|group=note|Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&nbsp;\u2013 and by whatever name&nbsp;\u2013 are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s\" (p. 227).}} Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.{{refn|group=note|Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, [[Nyanaponika]] (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).}}\n\nAccording to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial traditions, and the Tibetan tradition,<ref name=\"Ray2004\">Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']</ref> the Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).<ref>These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269\u201370, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].</ref>\n\nThrough the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]]) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions.<ref name=\"Ray2004\"/> In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.<ref>See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267\u201368, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].

Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]] from around the 5th century, and influenced [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Chinese martial arts]].\n\nLivia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Taoist meditation: \"concentrative\", \"insight\", and \"visualization\".<ref>Kohn, Livia (2008), \"Meditation and visualization,\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'', ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118.</ref> ''Ding'' [[wikt:\u5b9a|\u5b9a]] (literally means \"decide; settle; stabilize\") refers to \"deep concentration\", \"intent contemplation\", or \"perfect absorption\". ''Guan'' [[wikt:\u89c0|\u89c0]] (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) Taoist masters based upon the ''[[Tiantai]]'' Buddhist practice of ''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. ''Cun'' [[wikt:\u5b58|\u5b58]] (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School]]s.

Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Modern spirituality===\n[[File:Jawlensky Meditation 1290065.jpg|thumb|upright|''Meditation''.
