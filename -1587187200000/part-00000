Ever since the Revolutionary War, when the ill-equipped and poorly trained Army of General Washington suffered in the cold at [[Valley Forge]], some phase of almost every conflict in which the United States has been engaged in, has been fought in mountains or cold, or both. However, specialized training of units for cold weather and mountain warfare was not seriously undertaken until the approach of World War II.\n*Training for extended operations in cold and mountainous areas was initiated in November 1941 with the activation of the 87th Mountain Infantry and the Mountain and Winter Warfare Board at Fort Lewis, Washington. Training and testing were conducted by these organizations at Mount Rainier, Washington throughout the winter of 1941 - 1942. These units were later to become the nucleus for the first cold weather and mountain training center to be established by the U.S. Army.\n*While the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment was undergoing training at Mount Rainier, plans were being made and a site was being selected for a division-sized center for cold weather and mountain warfare training. In 1942, the Mountain Training Center, with members of the 87th Mountain Infantry as a cadre, opened at [[Camp Hale]]. This was the first U.S. Army training center designed specifically for cold weather and mountain training.\n*Training of the 10th Mountain Division for its future role of fighting in the mountains of Italy was the prime accomplishment of the Mountain Training Center during World War II. However, this was not the only training conducted by the Center. In addition to training many smaller units at Camp Hale, training detachments were sent to such locations as Camp McCoy, Wisconsin; Pine Camp, New York; and Elkins, West Virginia and Adak Island, Alaska to assist in the training of units in the unique requirements of mountain and cold weather operations.\n*At the end of World War II, the mission of the Mountain Training Center at Camp Hale was moved to [[Camp Carson, Colorado]]. Camp Carson was the only U.S. Army Center for this type of training until 1948, when the decision was made to organize a school for arctic operations at Big Delta, Alaska later named Fort Greely.\n*In November 1948, the Army Arctic School was established at Big Delta with the primary mission of providing instruction in summer and winter operations under arctic and sub-arctic conditions. This training included arctic survival, mountaineering, skiing, and solutions to tactical, technical and logistical problems in cold regions. In July 1949, the Army Arctic School was redesignated the Army Arctic Indoctrination School, with no change in the mission.\n*For approximately eight years, training in mountain and cold weather operations were conducted simultaneously at Camp Carson, Colorado and Fort Greely, Alaska. However, in 1957, the total responsibility for cold weather and mountain training was transferred to Alaska. The Arctic Indoctrination School was redesignated the U.S. Army Cold Weather and Mountain School and was given the mission of developing cold weather and mountain warfare doctrine, tactics and techniques, and training individuals in these subjects\n*Throughout the years as the Arctic School, Arctic Indoctrination School, and Cold Weather and Mountain School, training was conducted on an individual basis. Students from reserve component and active Army units throughout the continental United States were graduated as instructors in cold weather and mountain operations. However, early in 1963, the Department of the Army concluded that the training in cold weather and mountain operations would be of more beneficial to units than individual training. Therefore, in April 1963, the U.S. Army Cold Weather and Mountain School was redesignated the U.S. Army Northern Warfare Training Center and given the mission of training individuals as well as units in the conduct of warfare in cold and mountainous regions.\n*Today, The Northern Warfare Training Center is responsible for maintaining the U.S. Army's state of the art in cold weather and mountain warfare. The Center provides training in these subjects to both active and reserve components and assists in the development of tactics and techniques for such operations.\n\n==Courses offered==\n[[File:Northern Warfare Training Center.jpg|center|border|700px]]\n*''[http://www.wainwright.army.mil/nwtc/cwoc.htm CWOC - Cold Weather Orientation Course]:'' This course familiarizes commanders and staff officers with the knowledge/skills required in successfully planning and conducting operations in a cold, snow-covered environment.

The cars replaced all remaining [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42s]] and are expected to replace all remaining [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32s]].\n\nOriginally, the R179 order was supposed to contain 208 cars that were each {{convert|75|ft|m}} long. In the 2010\u20132014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were {{convert|60|ft|m}} long, similar to the car lengths of the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] and [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160]] orders, with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} five-car sets because the R179s would be replacing the 75-foot-long [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]], which were arranged in 300-foot-long four-car sets. A minority of the R179s were to be arranged in {{convert|240|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} four-car sets. In 2011, the order was reduced to 300 60-foot-long cars with no additional option orders. Because of the R44s' earlier than planned retirement and the R32s and R42s assigned to services utilizing eight-car trains at the time, the setup was reversed, with the majority of the R179s being arranged in four-car sets.\n\nThe $599 million contract for the R179s' construction was awarded to Bombardier in 2012. At the time, the first R179 train was set to be delivered in December 2014 and the last train would be delivered in July 2017. Because of manufacturing defects during the construction process, the timeline for delivery was pushed back two years, and the cost of the contract rose to $735 million. The first R179 cars were delivered in September 2016, and the first test train of eight cars was placed in service in November 2017. The test train passed its 30-day in-service test in December 2017, which allowed the remaining R179s to be gradually placed in service. All cars were expected to be delivered by early 2019. However, starting in December 2018, several cars had to be withdrawn from service due to defects, and in January 2019, deliveries were temporarily halted while these defects were being fixed. In January 2020, the R179s were experiencing door problems, leading to the entire fleet being pulled from revenue service for a short period.\n\nIn January 2018, sixteen more cars were added to the order as part of a settlement so that there would be 24 five-car sets instead of the 8 originally projected and 49 four-car sets instead of the original 65. In January 2019, two more cars were added to the order as a part of a settlement for further damages. All cars were delivered by December 2019, and had entered service by March 2020.\n\n==Description and features==\nThe R179s are numbered 3010-3327. Cars numbered 3010-3049 & 3238-3327 are configured into five-car sets, which are assigned to the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] and  based out of [[Pitkin Yard]]. Cars numbered 3050-3237 are configured into four-car sets, which are split between the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J and Z]] (based out of [[East New York Yard]]) and the [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] (based out of [[207th Street Yard]]).\n\n[[File:From the J Train 05 - R179.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The FIND screen of the R179]]\nThe R179 cars are equipped with updated control systems, [[HVAC]] and public address systems. They are visually very similar to the [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]], but the two car types are not interoperable with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160523_1030_Transit.pdf|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting May 2016|date=May 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe R179s, like the R160s, employ an advanced alternative to electronic strip maps called the [[New Technology Train#FIND displays|\"Flexible Information and Notice Display\"]] (\"FIND\"), which are manufactured by Axion Technologies Ltd. This includes an [[LCD]] screen displaying the route, route information, and advertisements, as well as a dynamic red, yellow, and green LED strip map that displays the next ten stations, plus five consecutive \"further stops\" to riders.<ref>https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149991</ref> There are three of these in every car. The display updates the stations at every stop, also giving the number of stops to each station listed. This allows for instant route or line changes with the correct information, which includes, but is not limited to, omitting certain stops (displayed as \"Will not stop\" in red). However, the LCD displays on the R179s that show the route are slightly larger than those on the R160s. Additionally, if the FIND has gone blank, the R179 FIND displays \"Route change: this map is not in use\", as opposed to the R160 FIND, which displays \"Listen to train crew for announcement.\"<ref name=\"Metro-NYCS-NTT-Dec2006\">{{cite news|url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/rail/article/210993/new-york-city-bringing-rail-into-the-21st-century|title=New York City Bringing Rail Into the 21st Century|date=December 6, 2006|work=[[Metro Magazine]]|last1=Seaton|first1=Charles|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MTA-CapitalOversight-Jan2016\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Meeting January 2016|date=January 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=January 23, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129071849/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|archivedate=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes-NYCSPromiseInfo-Nov20052\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/nyregion/30car.html|title=New Subway Cars Promise All Kinds of Information|last=Chan|first=Sewell|date=November 30, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Sewell Chan|accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149990|title=Showing Image 149990|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> The R179s also utilize the older door closing chimes used on the R142s and R142As, as opposed to the newer door chimes used on the R143s, R160s and R188s.

The cars replaced all remaining [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42s]] and are expected to replace all remaining [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32s]].\n\nOriginally, the R179 order was supposed to contain 208 cars that were each {{convert|75|ft|m}} long. In the 2010\u20132014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were {{convert|60|ft|m}} long, similar to the car lengths of the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] and [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160]] orders, with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} five-car sets because the R179s would be replacing the 75-foot-long [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]], which were arranged in 300-foot-long four-car sets. A minority of the R179s were to be arranged in {{convert|240|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} four-car sets. In 2011, the order was reduced to 300 60-foot-long cars with no additional option orders. Because of the R44s' earlier than planned retirement and the R32s and R42s assigned to services utilizing eight-car trains at the time, the setup was reversed, with the majority of the R179s being arranged in four-car sets.\n\nThe $599 million contract for the R179s' construction was awarded to Bombardier in 2012. At the time, the first R179 train was set to be delivered in December 2014 and the last train would be delivered in July 2017. Because of manufacturing defects during the construction process, the timeline for delivery was pushed back two years, and the cost of the contract rose to $735 million. The first R179 cars were delivered in September 2016, and the first test train of eight cars was placed in service in November 2017. The test train passed its 30-day in-service test in December 2017, which allowed the remaining R179s to be gradually placed in service. All cars were expected to be delivered by early 2019. However, starting in December 2018, several cars had to be withdrawn from service due to defects, and in January 2019, deliveries were temporarily halted while these defects were being fixed. In January 2020, the R179s were experiencing door problems, leading to the entire fleet being pulled from revenue service for a short period.\n\nIn January 2018, sixteen more cars were added to the order as part of a settlement so that there would be 24 five-car sets instead of the 8 originally projected and 49 four-car sets instead of the original 65. In January 2019, two more cars were added to the order as a part of a settlement for further damages. All cars were delivered by December 2019, and had entered service by March 2020.\n\n==Description and features==\nThe R179s are numbered 3010-3327. Cars numbered 3010-3049 & 3238-3327 are configured into five-car sets, which are assigned to the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] and  based out of [[Pitkin Yard]]. Cars numbered 3050-3237 are configured into four-car sets, which are split between the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J and Z]] (based out of [[East New York Yard]]) and the [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] (based out of [[207th Street Yard]]).\n\n[[File:From the J Train 05 - R179.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The FIND screen of the R179]]\nThe R179 cars are equipped with updated control systems, [[HVAC]] and public address systems. They are visually very similar to the [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]], but the two car types are not interoperable with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160523_1030_Transit.pdf|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting May 2016|date=May 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe R179s, like the R160s, employ an advanced alternative to electronic strip maps called the [[New Technology Train#FIND displays|\"Flexible Information and Notice Display\"]] (\"FIND\"), which are manufactured by Axion Technologies Ltd. This includes an [[LCD]] screen displaying the route, route information, and advertisements, as well as a dynamic red, yellow, and green LED strip map that displays the next ten stations, plus five consecutive \"further stops\" to riders.<ref>https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149991</ref> There are three of these in every car. The display updates the stations at every stop, also giving the number of stops to each station listed. This allows for instant route or line changes with the correct information, which includes, but is not limited to, omitting certain stops (displayed as \"Will not stop\" in red). However, the LCD displays on the R179s that show the route are slightly larger than those on the R160s. Additionally, if the FIND has gone blank, the R179 FIND displays \"Route change: this map is not in use\", as opposed to the R160 FIND, which displays \"Listen to train crew for announcement.\"<ref name=\"Metro-NYCS-NTT-Dec2006\">{{cite news|url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/rail/article/210993/new-york-city-bringing-rail-into-the-21st-century|title=New York City Bringing Rail Into the 21st Century|date=December 6, 2006|work=[[Metro Magazine]]|last1=Seaton|first1=Charles|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MTA-CapitalOversight-Jan2016\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Meeting January 2016|date=January 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=January 23, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129071849/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|archivedate=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes-NYCSPromiseInfo-Nov20052\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/nyregion/30car.html|title=New Subway Cars Promise All Kinds of Information|last=Chan|first=Sewell|date=November 30, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Sewell Chan|accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149990|title=Showing Image 149990|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> The R179s also utilize the older door closing chimes used on the R142s and R142As, as opposed to the newer door chimes used on the R143s, R160s and R188s.

of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].\n\nAs the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the People's Republic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217211144/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=%2Fcontent%2Fias%2Farchiv%2Fcds%2Fcds_0905.pdf|title=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|last=|first=|date=May 2009|website=giga-hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=17 February 2012|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed [[National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China|National Security Commission]], as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet.

(PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]].

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

Hale|Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser|S. Jay Keyser]] titled \"On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations,\"<ref>Hale, Kenneth and S. Jay Keyser. 1993. \"On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations.\" In ''The View from Building 20,'' edited by Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser, pp. 53-109. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-58124-0}}</ref> which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.\n\n==Nanosyntactic Operations==\nNanosyntax is a theory that seeks to fill in holes left by other theories when they seek to explain phenomena in language. The most notable phenomena that nanosyntax tackles is that of irregular conjugation<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal |last1=Taraldsen |first1=Knut Tarald |title=An introduction to Nanosyntax |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=11 December 2019 |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2018-0045  }}</ref>. For example, \"[[goose]]\" is irregular in that its plural form is not \"gooses\", but rather, \"geese\". This poses a problem to simple syntax, as without additional rules and allowances, \"geese\" should be found to be a suboptimal candidate for the plural of \"goose\" in comparison to \"gooses\".\n\n====Possible Solutions====\n\nThere are three manners by which syntacticians may attempt to resolve this. The first is a word-based treatment. In the above examples, \u201cduck\u201d, \u201cducks\u201d, \u201cgoose\u201d, and \u201cgeese\u201d are all counted as separate heads under the category of [[nouns]]. Whether a word denotes a singular or plural is then marked in the lexical entry, and there does not exist a Number head with which [[affixes]] can be included to modify the root word. This theory requires significant work on the part of the speaker to retrieve the correct word. It is also considered lacking in the face of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] concepts such as that displayed by the [[Wug test]] wherein children are able to correctly conjugate a previously unheard nonsense noun from its singular to its plural.\n\n[[Distributed morphology]] attempts to tackle the question through the process of fusion. Fusion is the process in which a noun head and its numeral head may fuse together under certain parameters to derive an irregular plural. In the above example, the plural of \u201cduck\u201d would simply select its plural allomorph \u201cducks\u201d, and the plural of \u201cgoose\u201d would select its plural allomorph \u201cgeese\u201d, created through the fusion of \u201cgoose\u201d and \u201c-s\u201d. In this way, distributed morphology is head-based. However, this theory still does not provide a reason as to why \"geese\" is preferable and a more optimal candidate for a plurality of geese over \"gooses\".\n\nNanosyntax goes about this dilemma by suggesting that rather than each word being a head, it is instead a phrase and can therefore be made into a subtree. Within the tree, heads can be assigned to override other heads in specific contexts. For example, if there is a head that says \"-s\" is added to a noun to turn it from a singular noun to a plural noun, but a head overrides it in the case of an irregularly conjugated plural noun such as \"goose\", it will select for the operation of the superseding head. Since it uses a formula and not rote memorisation of lexical items, it bypasses the challenges brought forth by a word-based treatment, and due to the arrangement of heads and their precedence, also provides a solution to the optimality concerns of distributed morphology.\n\nNanosyntax functions based on three rules: phrasal lexicalisation, the Elsewhere principle, and syncretism.\n\n====Phrasal Lexicalisation====\n\nPhrasal lexicalisation is the concept that proposes that only lexical items can constitute terminal nodes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Michal |title=Nanosyntax: A short primer to a new approach to language |journal=Nordlyd |date=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |page=1-6 |pages=1-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Mical |title=Towards elegant parameters: Language variation reduces to the size of lexically stored trees. |journal=Ms. Troms\u00f8 University. |date=2011}}</ref>. When this principle is applied, we can say that in regular plural nouns, there is no special lexicalisation (denoted in the below example using X) that needs to apply, and so standard pluralisation rules apply. The following is an example using \"duck\" where because there is no additional lexicalisation of the plural noun, an -s is added to pluralise the noun:\n\nX \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK] [ Pl ]]\u2003\nduck \u2194 [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK](8)\u2003s \u2194 Pl\n\nThis principle also allows for a word like \"geese\" to lexicalise [goose[Pl<sup>0</sup>]. When an additional lexicalisation is present, instead of following the standard addition of -s to pluralise the noun, instead the lexicalisation rule takes over in the following manner: \n\ngeese \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> GOOSE] [ Pl ]].\n\n====Elsewhere Principle====\nThe Elsewhere Principle seeks to provide a solution to the question of which lexicalisation applies to the noun in question. In simple terms, the lexicalisation that is more specific will always take precedence over a more general lexicalisation.\n\nAs illustrated, syntactic structure S seeks either lexicalisation from  A \u2194 [xP X [YP Y [ZP Z ]]] or B \u2194 [YP Y [ZP Z ]], B will win out over A because B lexicalises in a more specific situation whereas A lexicalises more generally. This solves the problem that distributive morphology faces when determining optimal pluralisation for irregular nouns.\n\n====Syncretism====\n\n==Nanosyntax in Relation to Other Linguistic Aspects==\n\n== Tools of Nanosyntax ==\nNanosyntax uses a handful of tools in order to map out fine-grained elements of the language being analyzed. Beyond Spellout Principles, there are three main tools for this system, who's uses are outlined as such, based of the writings of Baunaz, Haegeman, De Clercq, and Lander in ''Exploring Nanosyntax'' <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-21|editor-last=Baunaz|editor-first=Lena|editor2-last=Haegeman|editor2-first=Liliane|editor3-last=De Clercq|editor3-first=Karen|editor4-last=Lander|editor4-first=Eric|title=Exploring Nanosyntax|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001}}</ref>\n\n====[[Semantics]]====\nThe universal structure of compositionality is used in order for mapping structure within sentences semantically. This deals with mapping which features words are composed of such as which structures a given word is semantically \"constructed on\". Semantic considerations impact the parameters of structural seize of a sentence, based on semantic categories of things such as verbs. This is an important guiding feature on what elements of syntax need to be aligned with semantic markers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====[[Syncretism (linguistics)|Syncretism]]====\nThis system combines two distinct morphosyntactic structures on the surface of a sentence: such as two grammer function that are contained within a single lexical form. An example of this could be something such as the french \"\u00e0\" which can be used to indicate a location or a goal; this is therefore a Location-Goal syncratism <ref>{{Cite book|last=Pantcheva, Marina|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/786337774|title=Decomposing Path: The Nanosyntax of Directional Expressions|publisher=University of Tromso|oclc=786337774}}</ref> . This can therefore be used for targeting adjacent cells, such as nominative and accusative cases in languages such as English<ref name=\":0\" />. Through using syncretism in Nanosyntax, we can pull out syntactic \"atoms\" within a sentence and find small features, as well as their linear order that could not be identified otherwise. \n\n==== Morphological Containment/Nesting ====\nMorphological containment pertains to the hierarchy of linear order within a syntactic structure.

Hale|Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser|S. Jay Keyser]] titled \"On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations,\"<ref>Hale, Kenneth and S. Jay Keyser. 1993. \"On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations.\" In ''The View from Building 20,'' edited by Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser, pp. 53-109. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-58124-0}}</ref> which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.\n\n==Nanosyntactic Operations==\nNanosyntax is a theory that seeks to fill in holes left by other theories when they seek to explain phenomena in language. The most notable phenomena that nanosyntax tackles is that of irregular conjugation<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal |last1=Taraldsen |first1=Knut Tarald |title=An introduction to Nanosyntax |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=11 December 2019 |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2018-0045  }}</ref>. For example, \"[[goose]]\" is irregular in that its plural form is not \"gooses\", but rather, \"geese\". This poses a problem to simple syntax, as without additional rules and allowances, \"geese\" should be found to be a suboptimal candidate for the plural of \"goose\" in comparison to \"gooses\".\n\n====Possible Solutions====\n\nThere are three manners by which syntacticians may attempt to resolve this. The first is a word-based treatment. In the above examples, \u201cduck\u201d, \u201cducks\u201d, \u201cgoose\u201d, and \u201cgeese\u201d are all counted as separate heads under the category of [[nouns]]. Whether a word denotes a singular or plural is then marked in the lexical entry, and there does not exist a Number head with which [[affixes]] can be included to modify the root word. This theory requires significant work on the part of the speaker to retrieve the correct word. It is also considered lacking in the face of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] concepts such as that displayed by the [[Wug test]] wherein children are able to correctly conjugate a previously unheard nonsense noun from its singular to its plural.\n\n[[Distributed morphology]] attempts to tackle the question through the process of fusion. Fusion is the process in which a noun head and its numeral head may fuse together under certain parameters to derive an irregular plural. In the above example, the plural of \u201cduck\u201d would simply select its plural allomorph \u201cducks\u201d, and the plural of \u201cgoose\u201d would select its plural allomorph \u201cgeese\u201d, created through the fusion of \u201cgoose\u201d and \u201c-s\u201d. In this way, distributed morphology is head-based. However, this theory still does not provide a reason as to why \"geese\" is preferable and a more optimal candidate for a plurality of geese over \"gooses\".\n\nNanosyntax goes about this dilemma by suggesting that rather than each word being a head, it is instead a phrase and can therefore be made into a subtree. Within the tree, heads can be assigned to override other heads in specific contexts. For example, if there is a head that says \"-s\" is added to a noun to turn it from a singular noun to a plural noun, but a head overrides it in the case of an irregularly conjugated plural noun such as \"goose\", it will select for the operation of the superseding head. Since it uses a formula and not rote memorisation of lexical items, it bypasses the challenges brought forth by a word-based treatment, and due to the arrangement of heads and their precedence, also provides a solution to the optimality concerns of distributed morphology.\n\nNanosyntax functions based on three rules: phrasal lexicalisation, the Elsewhere principle, and syncretism.\n\n====Phrasal Lexicalisation====\n\nPhrasal lexicalisation is the concept that proposes that only lexical items can constitute terminal nodes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Michal |title=Nanosyntax: A short primer to a new approach to language |journal=Nordlyd |date=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |page=1-6 |pages=1-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Mical |title=Towards elegant parameters: Language variation reduces to the size of lexically stored trees. |journal=Ms. Troms\u00f8 University. |date=2011}}</ref>. When this principle is applied, we can say that in regular plural nouns, there is no special lexicalisation (denoted in the below example using X) that needs to apply, and so standard pluralisation rules apply. The following is an example using \"duck\" where because there is no additional lexicalisation of the plural noun, an -s is added to pluralise the noun:\n\nX \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK] [ Pl ]]\u2003\nduck \u2194 [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK](8)\u2003s \u2194 Pl\n\nThis principle also allows for a word like \"geese\" to lexicalise [goose[Pl<sup>0</sup>]. When an additional lexicalisation is present, instead of following the standard addition of -s to pluralise the noun, instead the lexicalisation rule takes over in the following manner: \n\ngeese \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> GOOSE] [ Pl ]].\n\n====Elsewhere Principle====\nThe Elsewhere Principle seeks to provide a solution to the question of which lexicalisation applies to the noun in question. In simple terms, the lexicalisation that is more specific will always take precedence over a more general lexicalisation.\n\nAs illustrated, syntactic structure S seeks either lexicalisation from  A \u2194 [xP X [YP Y [ZP Z ]]] or B \u2194 [YP Y [ZP Z ]], B will win out over A because B lexicalises in a more specific situation whereas A lexicalises more generally. This solves the problem that distributive morphology faces when determining optimal pluralisation for irregular nouns.\n\n====Syncretism====\n\n==Nanosyntax in Relation to Other Linguistic Aspects==\n\n== Tools of Nanosyntax ==\nNanosyntax uses a handful of tools in order to map out fine-grained elements of the language being analyzed. Beyond Spellout Principles, there are three main tools for this system, who's uses are outlined as such, based of the writings of Baunaz, Haegeman, De Clercq, and Lander in ''Exploring Nanosyntax'' <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-21|editor-last=Baunaz|editor-first=Lena|editor2-last=Haegeman|editor2-first=Liliane|editor3-last=De Clercq|editor3-first=Karen|editor4-last=Lander|editor4-first=Eric|title=Exploring Nanosyntax|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001}}</ref>\n\n====[[Semantics]]====\nThe universal structure of compositionality is used in order for mapping structure within sentences semantically. This deals with mapping which features words are composed of such as which structures a given word is semantically \"constructed on\". Semantic considerations impact the parameters of structural seize of a sentence, based on semantic categories of things such as verbs. This is an important guiding feature on what elements of syntax need to be aligned with semantic markers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====[[Syncretism (linguistics)|Syncretism]]====\nThis system combines two distinct morphosyntactic structures on the surface of a sentence: such as two grammer function that are contained within a single lexical form. An example of this could be something such as the french \"\u00e0\" which can be used to indicate a location or a goal; this is therefore a Location-Goal syncratism <ref>{{Cite book|last=Pantcheva, Marina|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/786337774|title=Decomposing Path: The Nanosyntax of Directional Expressions|publisher=University of Tromso|oclc=786337774}}</ref> . This can therefore be used for targeting adjacent cells, such as nominative and accusative cases in languages such as English<ref name=\":0\" />. Through using syncretism in Nanosyntax, we can pull out syntactic \"atoms\" within a sentence and find small features, as well as their linear order that could not be identified otherwise. \n\n==== Morphological Containment/Nesting ====\nMorphological containment pertains to the hierarchy of linear order within a syntactic structure. As syncretism reveals linear oder, but does is unable to determine which direction the linear order occurs in. This is where morphological containment is required. It is used in this context to posit the hierarchy which is possible. An example of this would be in the hierarchy of cases, where syncretism can determine the linear order is COM > INS > DAT > GEN > ACC > NOM or NOM > ACC > GEN > DAT > INS > COM, but morphological containment decides it is NOM or COM initial.<ref name=\":1\" /> These features can be understood as sets of each other, where features build on top of one another, where the first feature is a singleton, but the next feature is the first and second nested within itself- and so on. These sets can be referred to as the above mentioned features, or to simplify the nesting of the features, one can label them as  K<sub>1</sub> as proposed by Pavel Caha<ref>The Nanosyntax of Case, Pavel Caha, July 2009 \n\nhttps://munin.uit.no/bitstream/handle/10037/2203/thesis.pdf?sequence=1</ref>.

Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' \"participation in the Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"intellectual existences.\" Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] and, in a Romantic vein, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \"official philosophy\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David K.|last=Nartonis|title=Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795\u20131846|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2005|volume=66|issue=3|pages=437\u2013449|jstor=3654189|doi=10.1353/jhi.2005.0045}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles W.

In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, [[Walter Camp]], former captain of the Yale football team, suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface, so other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html|title=History of American Football|publisher=Newsdial.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n[[File:Harvard stadium 2009h.JPG|thumb|[[Harvard Stadium]], home of [[Harvard Crimson]] and the [[Boston Cannons]]]]\n\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|left|Harvard men's eight crew at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], 2004]]\n\nEven older than Harvard{{ndash}}Yale football rivalry, the Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta is held each June on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in eastern Connecticut.

Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' \"participation in the Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"intellectual existences.\" Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of [[Common Sense Realism]] derived from Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Dugald Stewart]], whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] and, in a Romantic vein, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \"official philosophy\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.<ref>{{cite journal|first=David K.|last=Nartonis|title=Louis Agassiz and the Platonist Story of Creation at Harvard, 1795\u20131846|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=2005|volume=66|issue=3|pages=437\u2013449|jstor=3654189|doi=10.1353/jhi.2005.0045}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles W.

In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, [[Walter Camp]], former captain of the Yale football team, suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface, so other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html|title=History of American Football|publisher=Newsdial.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n[[File:Harvard stadium 2009h.JPG|thumb|[[Harvard Stadium]], home of [[Harvard Crimson]] and the [[Boston Cannons]]]]\n\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|left|Harvard men's eight crew at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], 2004]]\n\nEven older than Harvard{{ndash}}Yale football rivalry, the Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta is held each June on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in eastern Connecticut.

The bottom end of the cashew apple attaches to the cashew nut, which is encased in a shell. In botanical terms, the cashew apple is an [[accessory fruit]] that grows on the cashew seed (which is the nut).\n\nThe cashew apple can be eaten fresh, cooked in curries, or fermented into vinegar, as well as an alcoholic drink. It is also used to make preserves, chutneys, and jams in some countries such as India and Brazil. In many countries, particularly in South America, the cashew apple is used to flavor drinks, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic.<ref name=morton/>\n\nCashew nuts are more widely traded than cashew fruits, because the fruit, unlike the nut, is easily bruised and has very limited shelf life.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=Cashew Juice, the Apple of Pepsi's Eye|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/business/international/cashew-juice-the-apple-of-pepsis-eye.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2014-08-08|accessdate=2015-11-24|issn=0362-4331|first=Stephanie|last=Strom}}</ref> Cashew apple juice, however, may be used for manufacturing blended juices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen consumed, the apple's [[astringency]] is sometimes removed by steaming the fruit for five minutes before washing it in cold water.

Fermented juice then undergoes a double distillation process. The resulting beverage is called [[Feni (liquor)|''feni'' or fenny]]. ''Feni'' is about 40\u201342% alcohol. The single-distilled version is called ''urrac'', which is about 15% alcohol.\n\nIn the southern region of [[Mtwara]], [[Tanzania]], the cashew apple (''bibo'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is dried and saved. Later, it is reconstituted with water and fermented, then distilled to make a strong liquor named ''gongo''.\n\nIn Mozambique, cashew farmers commonly make a strong liquor from the cashew apple. It is known under various names in the local languages of Mozambique (''muchekele'' in Emakua, spoken in the North; ''xicadju'' in Changana, spoken in the South). In contrast to the above-mentioned ''feni'' of Goa, the cashew liquor made in Mozambique does not involve the extraction of the juice from the cashew apples. Following harvest and the removal of the nuts, the apples are spread on the ground under trees and courtyards and allowed to lose water and ferment. The shrivelled fruits are then used for distillation.\n\n==Animal feed==\nDiscarded cashew nuts unfit for human consumption, alongside the residues of oil extraction from cashew kernels, can be used to feed livestock.

The bottom end of the cashew apple attaches to the cashew nut, which is encased in a shell. In botanical terms, the cashew apple is an [[accessory fruit]] that grows on the cashew seed (which is the nut).\n\nThe cashew apple can be eaten fresh, cooked in curries, or fermented into vinegar, as well as an alcoholic drink. It is also used to make preserves, chutneys, and jams in some countries such as India and Brazil. In many countries, particularly in South America, the cashew apple is used to flavor drinks, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic.<ref name=morton/>\n\nCashew nuts are more widely traded than cashew fruits, because the fruit, unlike the nut, is easily bruised and has very limited shelf life.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=Cashew Juice, the Apple of Pepsi's Eye|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/business/international/cashew-juice-the-apple-of-pepsis-eye.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2014-08-08|accessdate=2015-11-24|issn=0362-4331|first=Stephanie|last=Strom}}</ref> Cashew apple juice, however, may be used for manufacturing blended juices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen consumed, the apple's [[astringency]] is sometimes removed by steaming the fruit for five minutes before washing it in cold water.

Fermented juice then undergoes a double distillation process. The resulting beverage is called [[Feni (liquor)|''feni'' or fenny]]. ''Feni'' is about 40\u201342% alcohol. The single-distilled version is called ''urrac'', which is about 15% alcohol.\n\nIn the southern region of [[Mtwara]], [[Tanzania]], the cashew apple (''bibo'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is dried and saved. Later, it is reconstituted with water and fermented, then distilled to make a strong liquor named ''gongo''.\n\nIn Mozambique, cashew farmers commonly make a strong liquor from the cashew apple. It is known under various names in the local languages of Mozambique (''muchekele'' in Emakua, spoken in the North; ''xicadju'' in Changana, spoken in the South). In contrast to the above-mentioned ''feni'' of Goa, the cashew liquor made in Mozambique does not involve the extraction of the juice from the cashew apples. Following harvest and the removal of the nuts, the apples are spread on the ground under trees and courtyards and allowed to lose water and ferment. The shrivelled fruits are then used for distillation.\n\n==Animal feed==\nDiscarded cashew nuts unfit for human consumption, alongside the residues of oil extraction from cashew kernels, can be used to feed livestock. Animals can also eat the leaves of cashew trees.<ref>Heuz\u00e9 V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2017. Cashew (Anacardium occidentale) nuts and by-products.
