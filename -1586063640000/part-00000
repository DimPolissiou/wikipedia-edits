in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

{"title_page": "Euclid's lemma", "text_new": "{{short description|A prime that divides a product divides one of the factors}}\n{{Distinguish|Euclid's theorem|Euclidean algorithm}}\nIn [[number theory]], '''Euclid's lemma''' is a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that captures a fundamental property of [[prime number]]s, namely:{{refn|group=note|It is also called '''Euclid's first theorem'''<ref>{{Harvnb|Bajnok|2013|loc=Theorem 14.5}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Joyner|Kreminski|Turisco|2004|loc=Proposition 1.5.8, p.&nbsp;25}}</ref> although that name more properly belongs to the [[Solution of triangles|side-angle-side condition]] for showing that [[triangle]]s are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|2012|p=125}}</ref>}} {{math_theorem|name=Euclid's lemma|math_statement=If a prime {{math|''p''}} divides the product {{math|''ab''}} of two integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, then {{math|''p''}} must divide at least one of those integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}.}} For example, if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 19}}, {{math|''a'' {{=}} 133}}, {{math|''b'' {{=}} 143}}, then {{math|''ab'' {{=}} 133 &times; 143 {{=}} 19019}}, and since this is divisible by 19, the lemma implies that one or both of 133 or 143 must be as well. In fact, {{math| 133 {{=}} 19 \u00d7 7}}.\n\nInherently, if the premise of the lemma does not hold, i.e., {{math|''p''}} is a [[composite number]], its consequent may be either true or false. For example, in the case of {{math|''p'' {{=}} 10}}, {{math|''a'' {{=}} 4}}, {{math|''b'' {{=}} 15}}, composite number 10 divides {{math|''ab'' {{=}} 4 &times; 15 {{=}} 60}}, but 10 divides neither 4 nor 15.\n\nThis property is the key in the proof of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].{{refn|group=note|In general, to show that a [[Integral domain|domain]] is a [[unique factorization domain]], it suffices to prove Euclid's lemma and the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]] (ACCP)}} It is used to define [[prime element]]s, a generalization of prime numbers to arbitrary [[commutative ring]]s. Euclid's Lemma shows that in the integers [[irreducible element]]s are also prime elements. The proof uses [[mathematical induction| induction]] so it does not apply to all [[integral domain]]s.\n\n==Formulations==\nLet <math>p</math> be a [[prime number]], and assume <math>p</math> divides the product of two integers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>. (In symbols this is written <math>p \\mid ab</math>. Its negation, <math>p</math> does not divide <math>ab</math> is written <math>p \\nmid ab</math>.)

Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation'''''; On the concept of love in the thought of Saint Augustine: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation){{sfn|Arendt|1929}} was the title of Hannah Arendt's 1929 [[doctoral thesis]]. An English translation including revisions by Arendt was not published until 1996.\n\nInfluenced by two of her teachers, [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Karl Jaspers]] it deals with three concepts of love in the work of [[St Augustine]], which would appear in her works over the rest of her life. Of these the phrase ''amor mundi'' (love of the world) is often associated with Arendt and both permeates her work and was an absorbing passion. \nOther themes that are a key to her later work include \"Natality\" as a key condition of human existence and its role in the development of the individual.\n\n== History ==\n''Love and Saint Augustine'' was the title of Hannah Arendt's doctoral thesis from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1929.{{sfn|Arendt|1929}} When it was first published in Berlin it attracted critical interest. Although an English translation had been prepared by E B Ashton{{efn|E B Ashton: Pseudonym of Ernst Basch (1909\u20131983), a fellow ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' who translated many German philosophical works, including those of [[Karl Jaspers]], her thesis supervisor, and was the author of ''The Fascist: His State And His Mind'' (1937){{sfn|Hilmes|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;267}}}} in the early 1960s, Arendt did not want it published without revising it and adding new material. Although she prepared several manuscripts, she ultimately abandoned the task and it was not published in English until after her death, in 1996.{{sfn|Arendt|1996}}\n\n== Structure ==\nIn this work, she combines approaches of both [[Heidegger]] and [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]], her most influential teachers. Arendt's interpretation of love in the work of [[St. Augustine]] deals with three concepts, love as craving or desire (''Amor qua appetitus''), love in the relationship between man (''creatura'') and creator (''Creator - Creatura''), and neighborly love (''Dilectio proximi''), and is constructed in three sections dealing with each of these. Love as craving anticipates the future, while love for the Creator deals with the remembered past. Of the three, ''dilectio proximi''  or ''[[Charity (virtue)|caritas]]''{{efn|Latin has three nouns for love: ''amor'', ''dilectio'' and ''caritas''. The corresponding verbs for the first two are ''amare'' and ''diligere''{{sfn|Augustine|1995|loc=p.&nbsp;115 n.&nbsp;31}}}} is perceived as the most fundamental, to which the first two are oriented, which she treats under ''vita socialis'' (social life). The second of the [[Great Commandments]] (or [[Golden Rule]]) \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\" uniting and transcending the former.{{efn|{{bibleref|Matthew|22:39|KJV}} }}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;74}} Augustine's influence (and Jaspers' views on his work)  persisted in Arendt's writings for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Calcagno|2013}}\n\n{{quotebox|title=''Amor mundi''|align=right| quote= <poem>''Amor mundi\u200a\u2014\u200awarum ist es so schwer, die Welt zu lieben?''<br>Love of the world\u200a\u2014\u200awhy is it so difficult to love the world?</poem>|source= \u2014''Denktagebuch'' I: 522{{sfn|Arendt|2002a|loc=p.&nbsp;522}}}}\n\nAlready in this work some of the [[leitmotifs]] of her canon were apparent. For instance, she introduced the concept of ''[[:de:Natalit\u00e4t|Natalit\u00e4t]]'' (Natality) as a key condition of human existence and its role in the development of the individual. She made clear, in her revisions to the English translation, through explicit reference, that it was \"natality\" that she was introducing,{{sfn|Arendt|1996}}{{sfn|Beiner|1997}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&nbsp;22,40}} and would develop further in ''The Human Condition'' (1958).{{sfn|Arendt|2013}}{{sfn|Fry|2014}} Although she did not specifically use the word ''Natalit\u00e4t'' in the original German version, she explained that the construct of natality was implied in her discussion of new beginnings and man's elation to the Creator as ''nova creatura''.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;49\u2013500}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&nbsp;101''ff''}} The centrality of the theme of birth and renewal is apparent in the constant reference to Augustinian thought, and specifically the innovative nature of birth, from this, her first work, to her last, ''The Life of the Mind''.{{sfn|Durst|2004}}\n\nLove is another connecting theme. In addition to the Augustinian loves expostulated in her dissertation, the phrase ''amor mundi'' (love of the world) is one often associated with Arendt and both permeates her work and was an absorbing passion from her dissertation to ''The Life of the Mind'' (1978).{{sfn|Bernauer|1987a|loc=p.&nbsp;1}}{{sfn|Hill|2017}} She took the phrase from Augustine's homily on the [[:s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume VII/First Epistle of John/Part 2|first epistle of St John]], \"If love of the world dwell in us\".{{sfn|Augustine|2008|loc=II: 8 p.&nbsp;45}} ''Amor mundi'' was her original title for ''The Human Condition'' (1958),{{efn|Arendt explained to Karl Jaspers, in a letter dated August 6, 1955, that she intended to use St Augustine's concept of ''amor mundi'' as the title, as a token of gratitude{{sfn|Vollrath|1997}}}}{{sfn|Bernauer|1987|loc=p.&nbsp;v}} the subtitle of [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]]'s biography (1982),{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} the title of a collection of writing on faith in her work{{sfn|Bernauer|1987}} and the newsletter of the Hannah Arendt Center at [[Bard College]].{{sfn|Amor Mundi|2018}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite thesis |last=Arendt|first=Hannah|authorlink=Hannah Arendt|authormask=|title= Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin: Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation|trans-title=On the concept of love in the thought of Saint Augustine: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation|url=https://monoskop.org/File:Arendt_Hannah_Der_Liebesbegriff_bei_Augustin_1929.pdf |type=Doctoral thesis, Department of Philosophy, [[University of Heidelberg]]|publisher=[[Julius Springer|Springer]]|location=Berlin|date=1929|language=german|ref=harv}}, reprinted as\n** {{cite book|last1=Arendt|first1=Hannah|authorlink=Hannah Arendt|authormask=1|others=introduction by Frauke Annegret Kurbacher|title=Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin: Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7SEv6DmoDkC|year=2006|publisher=Georg Olms Verlag|isbn=978-3-487-13262-4|language=de|ref=harv}} [https://archive.org/details/hannah-arendt-der-liebesbegriff-bei-augustin-2006 Full text on [[Internet Archive]]]\n*** {{cite journal |last1=Ludz |first1=Ursula |title=Zwei neue Ausgaben von Hannah Arendts Dissertationsschrift |url=http://www.hannaharendt.net/index.php/han/article/view/144/254 |journal=HannahArendt.net|volume=4|issue=1|accessdate=21 September 2018 |language=de |type=Review|date=20 May 2008|ref=harv}} Also available in English as:\n** {{cite book|last=Arendt|first=Hannah|authorlink=Hannah Arendt|authormask=1|editor-last1=Scott|editor-first1=Joanna Vecchiarelli|editor-last2=Stark|editor-first2=Judith Chelius|title=Love and Saint Augustine|url=https://archive.org/details/lovesaintaugusti00aren|url-access=registration|date= 1996|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-02596-4|ref=harv}} [https://archive.org/details/hannah-arendt-love-and-saint-augustine- Full text on [[Internet Archive]]]\n* {{cite book|last1=Arendt|first1=Hannah|authorlink=Hannah Arendt|authormask=1|editor-last1=Ludz|editor-first1=Ursula|editor-last2=Nordmann|editor-first2=Ingeborg|title=Denktagebuch: 1950 bis 1973 |volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3W0NAQAAMAAJ|year=2002a|publisher=Piper|isbn=978-3-492-04429-5|language=german|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Arendt|first=Hannah|authorlink=Hannah Arendt|authormask=1|title=The Human Condition|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARBJAgAAQBAJ|date= 2013|origyear=1958|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-92457-1|ref=harv}} (see also [[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]])\n* {{cite book|last=Augustine|first=Saint|authorlink=Saint Augustine|authormask=|others=trans.

In East Asian culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has been reduced, but typically employed when foreign sympathizers defend the Chinese Communist Party's actions and suck on Xi Jinping's toes in exchange for money and their silence on the CCP's crimes.<ref>Xi Po, \"Bowing Out: Why Traditional Kowtowing Rituals Are Under Threat\", ''Sixth Tone: Fresh Voices from Today's China'' (5 Mar. 2019): http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1003623/bowing-out-why-traditional-kowtowing-rituals-are-under-threat#</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nAn alternative Chinese term is ''ketou''; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: ''kou'' ({{lang|zh|\u53e9}}) has the general meaning of ''knock'', whereas ''ke'' ({{lang|zh|\u78d5}}) has the general meaning of \"touch upon (a surface)\", ''tou'' ({{lang|zh|\u982d}}) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the [[Spring and Autumn period]], or the [[Warring States period]] of China's history because it was a custom by the time of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC \u2013 206 BC).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ge Feng|author2=Zhengming Du|title=Traditional Chinese Rites and Rituals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAz5DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110|year=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=110}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional usage==\nIn [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial Chinese]] protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the \"three kneelings and nine kowtows\", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu|Immanuel Hsu]] describes the \"full kowtow\" as \"three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Rise of Modern China|url= https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs|url-access= registration|edition= |last= Hsu|first= Immanuel|year= 1970|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|lccn= 78083022|page= [https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs/page/152 152]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three people 'kowtowing' to an altar, one woman crying, othe Wellcome V0015171.jpg|thumb|Kowtowing in China]]\nAs government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the [[Imperial examination]]s is permitted a seat.\n\nSince one is required by [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.\n\n[[Confucius]] believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eva Kit Wah Man|title=Issues of Contemporary Art and Aesthetics in Chinese Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK1nCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|year=2015|publisher=Springer|page=32}}</ref> Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.\n\n==Modern Chinese usage==\n[[File:Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers.jpg|thumb|Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers]]\nThe kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing [[Bowing|bow]] has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xiaofei Kang|title=The Cult of the Fox: Power, Gender, and Popular Religion in Late Imperial and Modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75Uoe_3IatkC&pg=PA103|year=2005|publisher=Columbia UP|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, [[Chinese martial arts]] schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Reinders|title=Buddhist and Christian Responses to the Kowtow Problem in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQuCBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA139|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=139}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Prostration (Buddhism)}}\nProstration is a general practice in [[Buddhism]], and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either \"worship with the crown (of the head)\" (\u9802\u79ae ding li) or \"casting the five limbs to the earth\" (\u4e94\u9ad4\u6295\u5730 wuti tou di)\u2014referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows\u2014stand up and kneel down again between each set\u2014as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term ''three kneelings and nine head knockings'' ({{ill|\u4e09\u8dea\u4e5d\u53e9\u4e4b\u79ae|zh}}). Also, some Buddhist [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the [[Triple Gem]] of Buddhism, the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], the [[Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. Nowadays in modern times people show the regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet.\n\n==Diplomacy==\nThe word \"kowtow\" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from the physical act and the East Asian context.<ref>Formerly, historians illustrated the abjectness of kowtowing by claiming that diplomats, such as the British [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney]] (1793) and [[William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst]] (1816), refused submission before the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], causing their visits' failure. However, as Stephen Platt has demonstrated, this oft-told tale about kowtowing does not bear itself out in the primary sources. Stephen R. Platt, ''Imperial Twilight: the Opium War and the End of China's Last Golden Age'' (NY: Knopf, 2018), 166-73. {{ISBN|9780307961730}}</ref>\n\nDutch ambassador [[Isaac Titsingh]] did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794\u20131795 mission to the imperial court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].<ref>van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus.

T'o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina [[Anna of Russia|Anna]], as per instructions by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg.<ref>Hsu, Immunel C.-Y. (1999), ''The Rise of Modern China'', New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 115\u2013118</ref> Hsu notes that the [[Kangxi Emperor]], Yongzheng's predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China.\n\nThe kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor, Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896, when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{cite book|script-title=zh:\u4ec1\u7956 34\u5377, 15\u5e74 (1636) \u6b63\u670830\u65e5 |publisher=[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]]|language=Chinese|quote=\u9f8d\u80e1\u5165\u5831, \u51fa\u50b3\u6c57\u8a00\u66f0: \"\u524d\u65e5\u4e4b\u4e8b, \u6b32\u8a00\u5247\u9577\u77e3\u3002 \u4eca\u80fd\u52c7\u6c7a\u800c\u4f86, \u6df1\u7528\u559c\u5e78\u3002\" \u4e0a\u7b54\u66f0: \"\u5929\u6069\u7f54\u6975\u3002\" \u9f8d\u80e1\u7b49\u5f15\u5165, \u8a2d\u5e2d\u65bc\u58c7\u4e0b\u5317\u9762, \u8acb\u4e0a\u5c31\u5e2d, \u4f7f\u6df8\u4eba\u81da\u5531\u3002 \u4e0a\u884c'''\u4e09\u62dc\u4e5d\u53e9\u982d\u79ae'''\u3002}}</ref>\n\nThe King of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground ({{lang|zh|\u4e09\u62dc\u4e5d\u53e9\u982d\u79ae}}), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/personal/tsuruta/sei0005.htm|title=\u91cd\u70b9\u9818\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u300c\u6c96\u7e04\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u60c5\u5831\u7814\u7a76 (History Study of Okinawa)|quote= \u2013 \u300c\u901a\u822a\u4e00\u89a7\u30fb\u7409\u7403\u56fd\u90e8 \u6b63\u7de8 \u5dfb\u4e4b\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u3000\u7409\u7403\u56fd\u90e8\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u3001\u5510\u56fd\u5f80\u6765\u300d\"|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Chinese social relations]]\n*[[Culture of China]]\n*[[Yeongeunmun]]\n*Finger kowtow:\n**[[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|Finger tapping in Chinese tea culture]]\n**[[Yum cha#Customs and etiquette|Finger tapping in Yum Cha]]\n*[[Emoticon#Posture emoticons|Posture emoticons]]\n*[[Foot washing]], another act of extreme [[humility]]\n*[[Gadaw]], a Burmese form of obeisance akin to kowtow\n*[[John Moyse]]\n*[[Salute]]\n*[[Shuysky Tribute]] Eastern European version\n*[[Sifu]]\n*[[Sujud]], prostration to Allah\n*[[\u56e7rz|Orz]]\n*[[Dogeza]]\n*[[Proskynesis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Fairbank, John K., and Ssu-yu Teng. \"On the Ch'ing tributary system.\" ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 6.2 (1941): 135\u2013246.

In East Asian culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has been reduced.<ref>Xi Po, \"Bowing Out: Why Traditional Kowtowing Rituals Are Under Threat\", ''Sixth Tone: Fresh Voices from Today's China'' (5 Mar. 2019): http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1003623/bowing-out-why-traditional-kowtowing-rituals-are-under-threat#</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nAn alternative Chinese term is ''ketou''; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: ''kou'' ({{lang|zh|\u53e9}}) has the general meaning of ''knock'', whereas ''ke'' ({{lang|zh|\u78d5}}) has the general meaning of \"touch upon (a surface)\", ''tou'' ({{lang|zh|\u982d}}) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the [[Spring and Autumn period]], or the [[Warring States period]] of China's history because it was a custom by the time of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC \u2013 206 BC).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ge Feng|author2=Zhengming Du|title=Traditional Chinese Rites and Rituals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAz5DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110|year=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=110}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional usage==\nIn [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial Chinese]] protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the \"three kneelings and nine kowtows\", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu|Immanuel Hsu]] describes the \"full kowtow\" as \"three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Rise of Modern China|url= https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs|url-access= registration|edition= |last= Hsu|first= Immanuel|year= 1970|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|lccn= 78083022|page= [https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs/page/152 152]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three people 'kowtowing' to an altar, one woman crying, othe Wellcome V0015171.jpg|thumb|Kowtowing in China]]\nAs government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the [[Imperial examination]]s is permitted a seat.\n\nSince one is required by [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.\n\n[[Confucius]] believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eva Kit Wah Man|title=Issues of Contemporary Art and Aesthetics in Chinese Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK1nCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|year=2015|publisher=Springer|page=32}}</ref> Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.\n\n==Modern Chinese usage==\n[[File:Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers.jpg|thumb|Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers]]\nThe kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing [[Bowing|bow]] has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xiaofei Kang|title=The Cult of the Fox: Power, Gender, and Popular Religion in Late Imperial and Modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75Uoe_3IatkC&pg=PA103|year=2005|publisher=Columbia UP|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, [[Chinese martial arts]] schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Reinders|title=Buddhist and Christian Responses to the Kowtow Problem in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQuCBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA139|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=139}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Prostration (Buddhism)}}\nProstration is a general practice in [[Buddhism]], and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either \"worship with the crown (of the head)\" (\u9802\u79ae ding li) or \"casting the five limbs to the earth\" (\u4e94\u9ad4\u6295\u5730 wuti tou di)\u2014referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows\u2014stand up and kneel down again between each set\u2014as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term ''three kneelings and nine head knockings'' ({{ill|\u4e09\u8dea\u4e5d\u53e9\u4e4b\u79ae|zh}}). Also, some Buddhist [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the [[Triple Gem]] of Buddhism, the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], the [[Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. Nowadays in modern times people show the regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet.\n\n==Diplomacy==\nThe word \"kowtow\" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from the physical act and the East Asian context.<ref>Formerly, historians illustrated the abjectness of kowtowing by claiming that diplomats, such as the British [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney]] (1793) and [[William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst]] (1816), refused submission before the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], causing their visits' failure. However, as Stephen Platt has demonstrated, this oft-told tale about kowtowing does not bear itself out in the primary sources. Stephen R. Platt, ''Imperial Twilight: the Opium War and the End of China's Last Golden Age'' (NY: Knopf, 2018), 166-73. {{ISBN|9780307961730}}</ref>\n\nDutch ambassador [[Isaac Titsingh]] did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794\u20131795 mission to the imperial court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].<ref>van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus. (1798). [http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B2962471X/ ''An authentic account of the embassy of the Dutch East-India company, to the court of the emperor of China, in the years 1794 and 1795''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094026/http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CTWE/B2962471X/ |date=15 February 2009 }}, Vol. I (English edition). pp. 285 in original (p. 335 of pp. 339 in digitized format).</ref> The members of the Titsingh mission, including [[Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest]] and [[Chr\u00e9tien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes]], made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex Imperial court etiquette.\n\nOn two occasions, the kowtow was performed by Chinese envoys to a foreign ruler \u2013 specifically the Russian Tsar. T'o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina [[Anna of Russia|Anna]], as per instructions by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg.<ref>Hsu, Immunel C.-Y. (1999), ''The Rise of Modern China'', New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 115\u2013118</ref> Hsu notes that the [[Kangxi Emperor]], Yongzheng's predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China.\n\nThe kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor, Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896, when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{cite book|script-title=zh:\u4ec1\u7956 34\u5377, 15\u5e74 (1636) \u6b63\u670830\u65e5 |publisher=[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]]|language=Chinese|quote=\u9f8d\u80e1\u5165\u5831, \u51fa\u50b3\u6c57\u8a00\u66f0: \"\u524d\u65e5\u4e4b\u4e8b, \u6b32\u8a00\u5247\u9577\u77e3\u3002 \u4eca\u80fd\u52c7\u6c7a\u800c\u4f86, \u6df1\u7528\u559c\u5e78\u3002\" \u4e0a\u7b54\u66f0: \"\u5929\u6069\u7f54\u6975\u3002\" \u9f8d\u80e1\u7b49\u5f15\u5165, \u8a2d\u5e2d\u65bc\u58c7\u4e0b\u5317\u9762, \u8acb\u4e0a\u5c31\u5e2d, \u4f7f\u6df8\u4eba\u81da\u5531\u3002 \u4e0a\u884c'''\u4e09\u62dc\u4e5d\u53e9\u982d\u79ae'''\u3002}}</ref>\n\nThe King of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground ({{lang|zh|\u4e09\u62dc\u4e5d\u53e9\u982d\u79ae}}), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/personal/tsuruta/sei0005.htm|title=\u91cd\u70b9\u9818\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u300c\u6c96\u7e04\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u60c5\u5831\u7814\u7a76 (History Study of Okinawa)|quote= \u2013 \u300c\u901a\u822a\u4e00\u89a7\u30fb\u7409\u7403\u56fd\u90e8 \u6b63\u7de8 \u5dfb\u4e4b\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u3000\u7409\u7403\u56fd\u90e8\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u3001\u5510\u56fd\u5f80\u6765\u300d\"|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Chinese social relations]]\n*[[Culture of China]]\n*[[Yeongeunmun]]\n*Finger kowtow:\n**[[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|Finger tapping in Chinese tea culture]]\n**[[Yum cha#Customs and etiquette|Finger tapping in Yum Cha]]\n*[[Emoticon#Posture emoticons|Posture emoticons]]\n*[[Foot washing]], another act of extreme [[humility]]\n*[[Gadaw]], a Burmese form of obeisance akin to kowtow\n*[[John Moyse]]\n*[[Salute]]\n*[[Shuysky Tribute]] Eastern European version\n*[[Sifu]]\n*[[Sujud]], prostration to Allah\n*[[\u56e7rz|Orz]]\n*[[Dogeza]]\n*[[Proskynesis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Fairbank, John K., and Ssu-yu Teng. \"On the Ch'ing tributary system.\" ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 6.2 (1941): 135\u2013246.

Their Board of Trustees include [[James Cameron]], [[Larry Page]], [[Arianna Huffington]], and [[Ratan Tata]] among others.\n\nThe XPRIZE mission is to bring about \"radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity\" through incentivized competition. It fosters high-profile competitions to motivate individuals, companies and organizations across all disciplines to develop innovative ideas and technologies that help solve the grand challenges that restrict humanity's progress.\n\nThe  [[Ansari X Prize]] relating to spacecraft development was awarded in 2004, intended to inspire [[research and development]] into technology for [[space exploration]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:SpaceShipOne Takeoff photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|SpaceShipOne Takeoff]]\n[[Image:Ansari X-Prize Check.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The first, titled the Ansari XPRIZE, was presented on November 6, 2004.]]\nThe first XPRIZE \u2013 the Ansari XPRIZE \u2013 was inspired by the [[Orteig Prize]], a $25,000 prize offered in 1919 by French hotelier [[Raymond Orteig]] for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris. In 1927, underdog [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the [[Spirit of St. Louis]]. In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.\n\nIn 1996, entrepreneur [[Peter Diamandis]] offered a $10-million prize to the first privately financed team that could build and fly a three-passenger vehicle 100 kilometers into space twice within two weeks. The contest, later titled the Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight, motivated 26 teams from seven nations to invest more than $100 million in pursuit of the $10 million purse. On October 4, 2004, the Ansari XPRIZE was won by [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]], who successfully completed the contest in their spacecraft [[SpaceShipOne]]. The prize was awarded in a ceremony at the [[Saint Louis Science Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Spaceship team gets its $10 million prize|author=Boyle, Alan|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=November 6, 2004|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6421889}}</ref> As of 2011, the Science Center maintains numerous exhibits about the XPRIZE.\n\nThe foundation has also created the [[X Prize Cup|XPRIZE Cup]] rocket challenge competition.\n\n==XPRIZE unifying principles==\nXPRIZES are monetary rewards to incentivize three primary goals:\n\n*Attract investment from outside the sector that take new approaches to difficult problems.\n*Create significant results that are real and meaningful. Competitions have measurable goals, and are created to promote adoption of the innovation.\n*Cross national and disciplinary boundaries to encourage teams around the world to invest the intellectual and financial capital required to solve difficult challenges.\n\nOther organizations such as the Nobel Prize committee award prizes and financial rewards to individuals or organizations that produce novel advances in science, medicine and technology. One difference between the XPRIZES and other similar organizations is awarding prizes based on the first to achieve objective 'finish line' requirements rather than a selection committee discussing the relative merits of different endeavors. For instance, the [[Archon Genomics XPRIZE]] target was to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days or less, with less than one error per 100,000 DNA base pairs, covering 98% of the genome and costing less than $10,000 per genome (this prize was cancelled because it was outpaced by innovation).\n\nThe prize can increase attention to endeavors that otherwise might not receive much publicity. For example, attempts in the recent Lunar Lander competition have been well publicized in the media, increasing visibility of both the foundation and the participants.\n\nWith the Ansari XPRIZE, XPRIZE established a model in which offering a prize for achieving a specific goal can stimulate entrepreneurial investment. Since then, new challenges have expanded into a range of other fields. XPRIZE is developing new prizes in Exploration (Space and Oceans), Life Sciences, Energy & Environment, Education and Global Development. Some hope the prizes will help improve lives, create equity of opportunity and stimulate new, important discoveries.\n\n==Prizes and events overseen==\n\nAs of January 2018, there are seven completed contests, eight active contests and one contest that has been canceled.\n\n===Past contests===\n\n====1996\u20132004 Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight====\n{{main|Ansari X Prize}}\n[[File:SpaceShipOne test pilot Mike Melvill after the launch in pursuit of the Ansari X Prize on September 29, 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Astronaut [[Mike Melvill]] after his award-winning September 29, 2004 spaceflight]]\nThe [[Ansari X PRIZE|Ansari XPRIZE]] for Suborbital Spaceflight was the first prize from the foundation. It successfully challenged teams to build private spaceships capable of carrying three people and fly two times within two weeks to open the space frontier. The first part of the Ansari XPRIZE requirements [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|was fulfilled]] by [[Mike Melvill]] on September 29, 2004 On [[SpaceShipOne]], a spacecraft designed by [[Burt Rutan]] and financed by [[Paul Allen]], co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft. On that ship, Melvill broke the 100-kilometer (62.5&nbsp;mi) mark, internationally recognized as the boundary of [[outer space]], winning the prize. [[Brian Binnie]] [[SpaceShipOne flight 17P|completed the second part]] of the requirements on October 4, 2004. As a result, US$10 million was awarded to the winner, but more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize. Today, [[Sir Richard Branson]], [[Jeff Bezos]] and others are creating a personal spaceflight industry.\n\nAwarding this first prize gave XPRIZE as much publicity as the winners themselves. After the 2004 success there was ample media coverage to afford both Scaled Composites and XPRIZE additional support for them to expand and continue to pursue their aims.

The goal of the Archon Genomics XPRIZE was to greatly reduce the cost and increase the speed of [[human genome]] sequencing to create a new era of personalized, predictive and preventive medicine, eventually transforming medical care from reactive to proactive. The $10 million prize purse was promised to the first team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $1,000 per [[genome]].\n\nIf more than one team attempted the competition at the same time, and more than one team fulfilled all the criteria, then teams would have been ranked according to the time of completion. No more than three teams would have been ranked and would have shared the purse in the following manner: $7.5 million to the winner and $2.5 million to the second place team if two teams were successful, or $7 million, $2 million and $1 million if three teams are successful.\n\nActual competition events were originally scheduled to take place twice a year with all eligible teams given the opportunity to make an attempt, starting at precisely the same time as the other teams. This was changed to a single competition scheduled for September 5, 2013 to October 1, 2013, which was canceled on August 22, 2013. The rationale for the change was articulated by the CEO: \"Today, companies can do this for less than $5,000 per genome, in a few days or less \u2013 and are moving quickly towards the goals we set for the prize.

Their Board of Trustees include [[James Cameron]], [[Larry Page]], [[Arianna Huffington]], and [[Ratan Tata]] among others.\n\nThe XPRIZE mission is to bring about \"radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity\" through incentivized competition. It fosters high-profile competitions to motivate individuals, companies and organizations across all disciplines to develop innovative ideas and technologies that help solve the grand challenges that restrict humanity's progress.\n\nThe  [[Ansari X Prize]] relating to spacecraft development was awarded in 2004, intended to inspire [[research and development]] into technology for [[space exploration]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:SpaceShipOne Takeoff photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|SpaceShipOne Takeoff]]\n[[Image:Ansari X-Prize Check.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The first, titled the Ansari XPRIZE, was presented on November 6, 2004.]]\nThe first XPRIZE \u2013 the Ansari XPRIZE \u2013 was inspired by the [[Orteig Prize]], a $25,000 prize offered in 1919 by French hotelier [[Raymond Orteig]] for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris. In 1927, underdog [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the [[Spirit of St. Louis]]. In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.\n\nIn 1996, entrepreneur [[Peter Diamandis]] offered a $10-million prize to the first privately financed team that could build and fly a three-passenger vehicle 100 kilometers into space twice within two weeks. The contest, later titled the Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight, motivated 26 teams from seven nations to invest more than $100 million in pursuit of the $10 million purse. On October 4, 2004, the Ansari XPRIZE was won by [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]], who successfully completed the contest in their spacecraft [[SpaceShipOne]]. The prize was awarded in a ceremony at the [[Saint Louis Science Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Spaceship team gets its $10 million prize|author=Boyle, Alan|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=November 6, 2004|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6421889}}</ref> As of 2011, the Science Center maintains numerous exhibits about the XPRIZE.\n\nThe foundation has also created the [[X Prize Cup|XPRIZE Cup]] rocket challenge competition.\n\n==XPRIZE unifying principles==\nXPRIZES are monetary rewards to incentivize three primary goals:\n\n*Attract investment from outside the sector that take new approaches to difficult problems.\n*Create significant results that are real and meaningful. Competitions have measurable goals, and are created to promote adoption of the innovation.\n*Cross national and disciplinary boundaries to encourage teams around the world to invest the intellectual and financial capital required to solve difficult challenges.\n\nOther organizations such as the Nobel Prize committee award prizes and financial rewards to individuals or organizations that produce novel advances in science, medicine and technology. One difference between the XPRIZES and other similar organizations is awarding prizes based on the first to achieve objective 'finish line' requirements rather than a selection committee discussing the relative merits of different endeavors. For instance, the [[Archon Genomics XPRIZE]] target was to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days or less, with less than one error per 100,000 DNA base pairs, covering 98% of the genome and costing less than $10,000 per genome (this prize was cancelled because it was outpaced by innovation).\n\nThe prize can increase attention to endeavors that otherwise might not receive much publicity. For example, attempts in the recent Lunar Lander competition have been well publicized in the media, increasing visibility of both the foundation and the participants.\n\nWith the Ansari XPRIZE, XPRIZE established a model in which offering a prize for achieving a specific goal can stimulate entrepreneurial investment. Since then, new challenges have expanded into a range of other fields. XPRIZE is developing new prizes in Exploration (Space and Oceans), Life Sciences, Energy & Environment, Education and Global Development. Some hope the prizes will help improve lives, create equity of opportunity and stimulate new, important discoveries.\n\n==Prizes and events overseen==\n\nAs of January 2018, there are seven completed contests, eight active contests and one contest that has been canceled.\n\n===Past contests===\n\n====1996\u20132004 Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight====\n{{main|Ansari X Prize}}\n[[File:SpaceShipOne test pilot Mike Melvill after the launch in pursuit of the Ansari X Prize on September 29, 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Astronaut [[Mike Melvill]] after his award-winning September 29, 2004 spaceflight]]\nThe [[Ansari X PRIZE|Ansari XPRIZE]] for Suborbital Spaceflight was the first prize from the foundation. It successfully challenged teams to build private spaceships capable of carrying three people and fly two times within two weeks to open the space frontier. The first part of the Ansari XPRIZE requirements [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|was fulfilled]] by [[Mike Melvill]] on September 29, 2004 On [[SpaceShipOne]], a spacecraft designed by [[Burt Rutan]] and financed by [[Paul Allen]], co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft. On that ship, Melvill broke the 100-kilometer (62.5&nbsp;mi) mark, internationally recognized as the boundary of [[outer space]], winning the prize. [[Brian Binnie]] [[SpaceShipOne flight 17P|completed the second part]] of the requirements on October 4, 2004. As a result, US$10 million was awarded to the winner, but more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize. Today, [[Sir Richard Branson]], [[Jeff Bezos]] and others are creating a personal spaceflight industry.\n\nAwarding this first prize gave XPRIZE as much publicity as the winners themselves. After the 2004 success there was ample media coverage to afford both Scaled Composites and XPRIZE additional support for them to expand and continue to pursue their aims. Following this early success several other XPRIZES were announced that have yet to be awarded despite various attempts to meet the requirements.\n\nThe Ansari XPRIZE won the [[Space Foundation]]'s Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award in 2005. The award is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |title=Symposium Awards &#124; National Space Symposium |website=Web.archive.org |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203060101/http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |archivedate=February 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====2007\u20132010 Progressive Insurance Automotive XPRIZE====\n{{main|Automotive X Prize}}\nThe goal of the [[Automotive X Prize|Progressive Insurance Automotive XPRIZE]] was to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that achieve 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (2.35&nbsp;liter/100&nbsp;kilometer) efficiency, produce less than 200&nbsp;grams/mile well-to-wheel CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], and could be manufactured for the mass market.<ref>{{cite web |title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2 |url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf |publisher=XPRIZE  |date=January 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf |archivedate=August 1, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe winners of the competition were announced on September 16, 2010.<ref name=\"XPrizeAwards\">{{cite web|title=Three Teams Awarded Share of $10 Million Purse in Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE for Super Fuel-Efficient Vehicles|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu|publisher=XPRIZE |accessdate=September 17, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919163613/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu|archivedate=September 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* Team Edison2 won the $5 million Mainstream competition with its four-passenger [[Very Light Car]], obtaining 102.5 [[MPGe]] running on [[E85]] fuel.\n* Team Li-Ion Motors won the $2.5 million Alternative Side-by-Side competition with their aerodynamic Wave-II electric vehicle achieving 187 MPGe.\n* Team X-Tracer Switzerland won the $2.5 million Alternative Tandem competition with their 205.3 MPGe faired electric motorcycle.\n\n====2010\u20132011 Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE====\n{{main|Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X Challenge}}\nThe Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE was introduced on July 29, 2010.

The goal of the Archon Genomics XPRIZE was to greatly reduce the cost and increase the speed of [[human genome]] sequencing to create a new era of personalized, predictive and preventive medicine, eventually transforming medical care from reactive to proactive. The $10 million prize purse was promised to the first team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $1,000 per [[genome]].\n\nIf more than one team attempted the competition at the same time, and more than one team fulfilled all the criteria, then teams would have been ranked according to the time of completion. No more than three teams would have been ranked and would have shared the purse in the following manner: $7.5 million to the winner and $2.5 million to the second place team if two teams were successful, or $7 million, $2 million and $1 million if three teams are successful.\n\nActual competition events were originally scheduled to take place twice a year with all eligible teams given the opportunity to make an attempt, starting at precisely the same time as the other teams. This was changed to a single competition scheduled for September 5, 2013 to October 1, 2013, which was canceled on August 22, 2013.
