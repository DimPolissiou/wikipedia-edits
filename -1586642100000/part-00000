Climatic zones also differ based on the aspect of slopes, their varying exposure to wind, sun and evaporation, and the varying areas of glacial and volcanic terrain.<ref name=\"mjbs\"/>  The southern-facing steppe areas are about 70% covered with grasses - Alpine oatgrass ([[Helictotrichon]], Hawkweed ([[Hieracium]]), Tundra fescue ([[Festuca]]) and others, and sedges such as Wide-leaf low sedge ([[Carex|Carex pediformis]]).  The trees in the forested areas are mostly Larch ([[Larix sibirica]]) and Siberian pine ([[Pinus sibirica]]).  \n\n==See also==\n* [[List of national parks of Mongolia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.protectedplanet.net/tarvagatai-nuruu-national-conservation-parks Map of boundaries, Tarvagatai Nuruu National Park - OpenStreetMap]\n* [https://rallyforrangers.org/national-parks/tarvagatain-nuruu-national-park/ Tarvagatain-Nuruu NP at Rally For Rangers]\n{{National parks of Mongolia}}\n\n[[Category:National parks of Mongolia]]\n", "name_user": "Every-leaf-that-trembles", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated label", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarvagatai_Nuruu_National_Park"}

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and the [[U.S. Labor Party|Labor Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1978|New York state election, 1978]], was held on November 7. Governor [[Hugh Carey]] was re-elected, and Secretary of State [[Mario Cuomo]] was elected Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The elections to the other two statewide elective offices resulted in a Republican Comptroller and a Democratic Attorney General. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,306,000; Republicans 1,913,000; Conservatives 243,000; Right to Life 130,000; Liberals 123,000; Libertarians 19,000; Socialist Workers 13,000; Communists 11,000; and Labor 9,000.\n\nSeven of the ten women members of the previous legislature were elected again: State Senators [[Olga A. M\u00e9ndez]] (Dem.), of [[East Harlem]], and [[Linda Winikow]] (Dem.), of [[Spring Valley, New York|Spring Valley]]; and Assemblywomen [[Elizabeth Connelly]] (Dem.), of [[Staten Island]]; [[Pinny Cooke]] (Rep.), of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]; [[Estella B. Diggs]] (Dem.), of [[the Bronx]]; and [[Gerdi E. Lipschutz]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]], were re-elected; and Assemblywoman [[Mary B. Goodhue]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]], was elected to the State Senate. [[Carol Berman]] (Dem.), of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]], was also elected to the State Senate. [[Rhoda S. Jacobs]] (Dem.), of [[Brooklyn]]; [[Joan B. Hague]] (Rep.), of [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]]; [[May W. Newburger]] (Dem.), of [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]]; [[Toni Rettaliata]] (Rep.), of [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]]; and [[Florence M. Sullivan]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Brooklyn]], were also elected to the Assembly. Thus the 183rd Legislature had 13 women members, surpassing the previous record of 11 in the [[181st New York State Legislature]] (1976).\n\nThe New York state election, 1979, was held on November 6. No statewide elective offices were up for election, and there were no vacancies in the Legislature.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the first regular session (the 202nd) at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 3, 1979;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/04/archives/governor-proposes-additional-tax-cut-to-foster-economy-225-million.html ''GOVERNOR PROPOSES ADDITIONAL TAX CUT TO FOSTER ECONOMY''] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 4, 1979 (subscription required)</ref> and recessed indefinitely in the early morning of June 17.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/18/archives/albany-session-closes-in-flurry-of-late-voting-but-both-houses.html ''Albany Session Closes in Flurry Of Late Voting''] in ''The New York Times'' on June 18, 1979 (subscription required)</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Fink]] (Dem.) was elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]].\n\n[[Warren M.

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and the [[U.S. Labor Party|Labor Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1978|New York state election, 1978]], was held on November 7. Governor [[Hugh Carey]] was re-elected, and Secretary of State [[Mario Cuomo]] was elected Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The elections to the other two statewide elective offices resulted in a Republican Comptroller and a Democratic Attorney General. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,306,000; Republicans 1,913,000; Conservatives 243,000; Right to Life 130,000; Liberals 123,000; Libertarians 19,000; Socialist Workers 13,000; Communists 11,000; and Labor 9,000.\n\nSeven of the ten women members of the previous legislature were elected again: State Senators [[Olga A. M\u00e9ndez]] (Dem.), of [[East Harlem]], and [[Linda Winikow]] (Dem.), of [[Spring Valley, New York|Spring Valley]]; and Assemblywomen [[Elizabeth Connelly]] (Dem.), of [[Staten Island]]; [[Pinny Cooke]] (Rep.), of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]; [[Estella B. Diggs]] (Dem.), of [[the Bronx]]; and [[Gerdi E. Lipschutz]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]], were re-elected; and Assemblywoman [[Mary B. Goodhue]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]], was elected to the State Senate. [[Carol Berman]] (Dem.), of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]], was also elected to the State Senate. [[Rhoda S. Jacobs]] (Dem.), of [[Brooklyn]]; [[Joan B. Hague]] (Rep.), of [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]]; [[May W. Newburger]] (Dem.), of [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]]; [[Toni Rettaliata]] (Rep.), of [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]]; and [[Florence M. Sullivan]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Brooklyn]], were also elected to the Assembly.

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nIf nominated, Biden would become the oldest major party nominee in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if elected and inaugurated, he would also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination.

In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates.

presidential election''' is scheduled for Tuesday, November 3, 2020. It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nIf nominated, Biden would become the oldest major party nominee in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if elected and inaugurated, he would also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination.

In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22.

It seems, that in the year [[3rd millennium BC|3000&nbsp;BCE]], on the longest day, the first rays of the sun shone through the opening in the north-east gate, which is 20 by 29&nbsp;meters. However, they did not shine in a perfect angle. It is assumed this is because the builders did not have sufficiently accurate architectural tools. The residents probably used the site to worship [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Ishtar]], the gods of fertility,<ref name=\"Aveni2001\"/> to thank them for the good harvest during the year. After the erection of the tomb in the center, the rays' path was blocked.\n; Burial site: It appears that the place of worship later became a burial site<ref name=\"Ruggles2005\">{{cite book |first=Clive L.N. |last=Ruggles |title=Ancient Astronomy: An encyclopedia of cosmologies and myth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9YYqiXm-lkC&pg=PA366 |accessdate=29 March 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-477-6 |pages=366\u2013368}}</ref> for leaders or other important individuals. Supporting this theory was the tomb in the dolmen. However, no human remains were found, only objects pointing to its function as a tomb. Also, even if it were a tomb, that was not the site's original function, as the tomb is 1,000&nbsp;years newer than the site itself.\n; Dakhma: Archaeologist Rami Arav suggests the site was used like the [[Dakhma]]s of the Zoroastrians, in which dead persons were laid out for birds to remove the flesh from their bones.<ref name=\"Israel's answer\" />\n; Calendar: Some believe the site was used as an ancient [[calendar]]. At the times of the two [[equinox]]es, the sun's rays would pass between two rocks, 2&nbsp;m in height, 5&nbsp;m in width, at the eastern edge of the compound.  According to Anthony Aveni and Yonatan Mizrachi the entrance to the center opens on sunrise of the summer solstice. Other notches in the walls indicate the spring and fall equinoxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeoastronomy/a/rujmelhiri.htm |title=Ancient Archaeoastronomy in the Golan Heights}}</ref>\n; Astronomical observations: Perhaps the site was used for [[Astronomy|astronomical]] observations of the [[constellation]]s, probably for [[Religion|religious]] calculations. Researchers found the site was built with dimensions and scales common for other period structures, and partly based on the stars' positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeoastronomy/a/rujmelhiri.htm |title=Ancient astronomy at Rujm el-Hiri: Star watching in ancient Israel}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nIn 2007, the site was excavated by Yosef Garfinkel and Michael Freikman of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

However, they did not shine in a perfect angle. It is assumed this is because the builders did not have sufficiently accurate architectural tools. The residents probably used the site to worship [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Ishtar]], the gods of fertility,<ref name=\"Aveni2001\"/> to thank them for the good harvest during the year.

Supporting this theory was the tomb in the dolmen. However, no human remains were found, only objects pointing to its function as a tomb.

At the times of the two [[equinox]]es, the sun's rays would pass between two rocks, 2&nbsp;m in height, 5&nbsp;m in width, at the eastern edge of the compound.  According to Anthony Aveni and Yonatan Mizrachi the entrance to the center opens on sunrise of the summer solstice.

Candice tells Margie that the act needs even \"more perfection\" in preparation for a visit from three talent agents. The academy director Dick Gibson (Claudio Cassinelli) meets with TV producers Bob Steiner and John Morris, who watch a video of the dance, and Candice learns that the men will only select three dancers for an upcoming TV show. That evening after the dance class is over, one of the dancers, Susan, is murdered in the locker room by an unseen person who chloroforms then stabs her in the heart with a long hairpin needle. NYPD Lieutenant Borges (Cosimo Cinieri) arrives on the scene to investigate. Also with Lt. Borges is the police profiler and psychotherapy professor Dr. Davis (Giuseppe Mannajuolo). With Candice nowhere to be found, suspicion begins to focus not only on her but on the victim's boyfriend Willy Stark (Christian Borromeo), as well as Dick Gibson.\n\nCandice arrives back at her apartment, where she finds Dick waiting. He wants to talk about the potential relationships between the students, and tries to convince Candice that there is nothing going on between him and any of the other students. While he is there, the DJ from the studio, Bob, phones Candice and updates her on the murder at the academy.\n\nThe next day, the routine at the campus continues as normal, causing Dick a great deal of upset, since nobody seems to care about Susan's death. At a nearby coffee shop, Lt. Borges talks to Dick about a possible rivalry between the dancers. That evening at a local nightclub, another student from the academy, Janice, dances alone for an audience and then walks home to her apartment. She finds Willy waiting and wanting to talk. In her bedroom, Janice finds a photograph of Willy and Susan, but when she calls out to him, he is gone. Janice finds her pet canary dead with a hairpin needle through its body. Panicked, she runs to the front door, where she is attacked and killed by the unseen assailant who thrusts a hairpin needle into her heart.\n\nCandice begins having nightmares of being attacked by a handsome young man (Ray Lovelock) wielding a long, ornamental needle identical to the one used in the killings. Candice becomes more obsessed with the dream assailant when she sees an advertising billboard which features him prominently. Unable to shake the feeling that they are in some way predetermined to meet, Candice tracks down the man in the poster to the seedy Fulton Hotel, and bribes the desk clerk for the key to \"Mr. Robinson's\" room. She explores the room, but is shocked when the handsome model returns suddenly. The man introduces himself as George Webb who, to Candice's repulsion, is a drunken and disheveled wreck. With what seems like disappointment mingled with terror, Candice flees from the room, leaving her purse and ID behind.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt. Borges records a phone call to the police station from a person claiming be the killer. When a voice analyst identifies it as Bart, one of the dancers, Borges arrests him. Bart confesses to the phone calls as well as to killing Susan because she was crazy, and Janice because she was Hispanic. Borges, however, states his belief that Bart is not the killer, but a pathological liar.\n\nGeorge goes to the academy to return Candice's purse where another dancer, Gloria, recognizes him from a modeling show they appeared in years earlier. Dick sees George and Candice on a security monitor and calls Borges saying that George must be the killer. Over lunch at a local Chinese restaurant, the relationship between Candice and George becomes closer when she confides in him about an incident years earlier, when a man on a motorcycle ran her over in a hit-and-run putting an end to her dancing career and forcing her to teach. Back at Candice's apartment, she gets a phone call from Phil (Lucio Fulci), a local talent agent, who has made a background check for her on George and informs her that he once had an affair with a young girl who later died. At the studio, Candice is attacked by Margie, using the killer's M.O., but she is subdued by Dick, who turns Margie over to the police.\n\nA few days later, Jill, another dancer, baby-sits for the wheelchair-bound Molly, who takes pictures of her. When Jill answers a knock on the front door, the killer forces his way into the apartment and stabs her with the hairpin. Molly frantically snaps away, but does not get a clear view of the killer's face. The police arrest Dick when he's found running away, claiming that he only arrived after the attack to find Jill dead. The following night, the killer attacks and kills Gloria in the locker room in the same manner.\n\nAt George's hotel room, Candice lets herself in and finds a hairpin and bottle of chloroform in his drawer. Candice rushes out to her car and drives away. George arrives and seeing what Candice found, tries to call her at her apartment, but she is not home. At the police station, Candice tells Borges of her discovery and that George is the killer and names the hotel where he is staying. Candice then goes over to the academy which has been closed down for the night, and finds Gloria dead in the locker room. She calls Borges and tells him to meet her at the academy.\n\nCandice runs to the manager's room and finds George there. He turns on the music and a video showing all the dancers who have been killed. George walks in with the hairpin murder weapon and asks Candice why she planted this evidence in his hotel room, thus connecting him to the murders. Candice then reveals that she has known from the very start that it was he, George, who was the hit-and-run motorcycle rider who ran her over, ruining her career, her future and her life. She tells him that she killed the young dancers out of jealousy of their talent, their beauty and their rising careers, all the while planning to frame him for the killings as her final act of revenge against him. She grabs George's pin-holding hand and intentionally impales herself on it. Just as she falls to the floor, breathing her last, Lt. Borges and Dr. Davis arrive on the scene but, before George can begin to explain, they reveal that they already know he is not the killer. When they saw the photo slide Molly took of the killer's jacket, they noticed that the buttons on the jacket were on the left side, indicating that it belonged to and was being worn by a woman. In addition, Candice told them details about the lion's head hairpin needle used in the killings, information that, since it had never been made public, only the killer could know. George leaves with Lt. Borges as the police seal off and investigate the scene.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Olga Karlatos]] as Candice Norman\n* [[Ray Lovelock (actor)|Ray Lovelock]] as George Webb\n* [[Claudio Cassinelli]] as Dick Gibson\n* Cosimo Cinieri as Lt.

It differs from the [[vestment]]s worn by the celebrants of the Eucharist, being normally made of fabrics such as wool, cotton or silk, as opposed to the fine [[brocade]]s used in vestments. It may also be worn by lay assistants such as acolytes and choirs.  It was abandoned by most of the Churches which originated in the sixteenth-century [[Reformation]].<ref name=\"tsol1\">Grisebrooke, W. Jardine. '''Vestments''' in Jones, Cheslyn, Wainright, Geoffrey & Yarnold, Edward. ''The Study of Liturgy'' SPCK: 1979, p.489</ref>\n\nLike [[vestments|Eucharistic vestments]] it derived originally from the formal secular dress of the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian era which survived in church usage after fashion had changed.<ref name=\"tsol1\"/>\n\nChoir dress also differs from \"house dress\" which is worn outside of a liturgical context (whether in the house or on the street). House dress may be either formal or informal.\n\n==Roman Catholic choir dress==\nChoir dress in the [[Catholic Church]] is worn by deacons, priests, regular prelates, bishops and cardinals when presiding at or celebrating a [[liturgy]] that is not the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], especially the [[Liturgy of the Hours]].\nBefore the Second Vatican Council the dress was more elaborate, and had dozens of varieties and colours. After The Second Vatican Council, it was reduced, however exceptions are sometimes granted for cathedral chapters.\n\nThe current dress is worn when attending Mass without celebrating or observing the Eucharist. It is worn by seminarians, instituted lectors and acolytes, and altar servers and choir members at Mass or other liturgical events.\n\nThe basic components of choir dress are:\n* the [[cassock]], with or without [[fascia (vestment)|fascia]] (fringed sash worn around the waist),\n* if the person is a brother or priest in a [[religious order]] that has its own [[religious habit|habit]] ([[Benedictines]], [[Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], etc.), the habit is worn in place of the cassock,\n* the [[surplice]] (or [[rochet]] if the wearer is a [[bishop]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], or [[canon (priest)|canon]]), and\n* the [[biretta]] (optional for secular priests unless their bishop requires its use, in which case it is mandatory).\n\nFor [[seminarian]]s, [[deacon]]s, and [[priest]]s the cassock is exactly the same as their normal cassock: a black cassock with black buttons, girded with a black fascia.\n\nPriests who hold additional honors may wear a different cassock: [[Chaplain of His Holiness|Chaplains of His Holiness]] wear a black cassock with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while [[Honorary Prelate]]s and [[Protonotary apostolic|Protonotaries apostolic]] wear a [[purple]] cassock with [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] piping and buttons with a purple fascia. A black cassock with [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress (academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic. [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] may wear the [[rochet]] (if the chapter has been granted usus rochetti by papal indult) with a distinctive [[mozzetta]], the particular colors of which are determined by the [[chapter (religion)|chapter]].\n\nBishops wear the above-mentioned purple cassock with scarlet piping, and add a [[pectoral cross]] suspended from a [[green]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] cord, a [[mozzetta]] over the rochet, and a purple [[zucchetto]] under the biretta. A [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] wears a [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] cassock with scarlet trim, pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the rochet, with a red zucchetto. The [[Pope]]'s choir dress includes a white cassock, rochet, red silk mozetta, red brocade stole and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.\n\nThe [[cope]] and/or [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] may be worn over choir dress when a cleric presides over a [[sacrament]] (for instance, at [[matrimony]], if not celebrated during Mass), or by the cleric presiding over prayers (for instance, the priest presiding at a solemn celebration of [[Vespers]] in the Liturgy of the Hours might wear cope and stole over choir dress, while other clergy present would wear simple choir dress of cassock and surplice).\n\nMonks who are neither deacons nor priests also have a form of choir dress: the full monastic habit with the monastic cowl forms their formal wear for attending the Liturgy of the Hours or Mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[File:Pope - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Cardinal - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Bishop - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Pope\n|Cardinal\n|Bishop\n|-\n|[[File:Higher Prelates of the Roman Curia and Protonotary Apostolic de numero - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Honorary Prelate and Apostolic Protonotary Supernumerary - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Chaplain of His Holiness - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Higher Prelates of the Roman Curia and<br>Apostolic protonotary ''de numero''\n|Apostolic protonotary supernumerary and<br>Honorary Prelate\n|Chaplain of His Holiness\n|-\n|[[File:Priest - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[[File:Canons - choir dresses.svg|center|470px]]\n|-\n|Priest or Deacon or Seminarian\n|colspan=\"2\"|Canon ([[Mozetta]] should be black, but can vary)\n|-\n|}\n\nSince 2006, priests of the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] have had their own choir dress, given to them by the Cardinal [[Archbishop of Florence]]. Their choir dress includes a rochet, a mozzetta, the cross of St. [[Francis de Sales]] on a blue and white ribbon, and a biretta with a blue pom. According to the Institute, \"The blue stands for our complete dedication to the [[Virgin Mary|Blessed Mother]] and is traditionally the color shown on St. Francis de Sales in most paintings of him,\" and \"The choir dress expresses the strong unity, spiritually, and identity of the Institute and adds solemnity to the [[Tridentine Mass|liturgy]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.institute-christ-king.org/institute/questions/ |accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Choir Dress (Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest).svg|400px|Canons, superiors and the prior general]]\n|-\n|Canons, superiors, and the prior general\n|-\n|}\n\n==Eastern choir dress==\n[[Image:Stjohn shanghai.png|thumb|right|200px|[[John (Maximovitch) of Shanghai and San Francisco|Saint John (Maximovich)]] wearing choir dress of an Orthodox bishop: [[klobuk]], [[outer riassa]], [[Panagia]], and episcopal [[mandyas]]; holding his [[paterissa]] (crozier).]]\n[[Image:By Grace of God, Ignatius Zakka I Iwas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]] (in red cassock) and a priest (in black).]]\nThe choir dress of clergy in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches are relatively similar. Over the inner [[cassock]] (''rasson'' or ''podrasnik''), a deep-sleeved ''[[cassock#Eastern practice (Orthodox)|exorason]]'' (''riassa''), which is often black, is worn. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], married clergy often wear grey, while monastic clergy wear black.  During the [[Easter|paschal]] season both monastic and married clergy will often wear a white inner cassock. Some Russian [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitans]] wear a white inner cassock and a blue outer when formally arriving to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\n===Byzantine Rite===\n\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy and [[Byzantine Catholic]]ism, [[monk]]s wear a black cloak, the ''[[mandyas]]'' over the outer cassock. The mandyas completely covers the monastic below the chin and reaches to the floor. In the Greek usage, the mandyas is usually only worn when performing certain liturgical roles; in the Slavic usage, all monks and [[nun]]s of the rank of [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism|Stavrophore]] or above wear the mandyas at every service, so long as they are in their own [[monastery]]. The mandyas of an [[hegumen]] ([[abbot]]) is of black silk, that of an [[archimandrite]] or [[bishop]] is of colored silk (specific usages will differ by jurisdiction), and has four square \"tablets\" on it: two at the neck and two at the feet. A bishop's mandyas additionally has \"rivers\" on it: three horizontal stripes either of gold (Greek practice) or red and white (Slavic practice).\n\nMonastic clergy wear different headcoverings than married clergy. Married clergy wear either a colored ''[[kamilavka|kalimaukion]]'' or ''[[skufia]]''; monastic clergy wear a black kalimaukion and [[Epanokamelavkion|veil]] (together known as the ''[[klobuk]]''). For monastics, the skufia is reserved for house dress, and the klobuk is worn in church. Russian [[archbishop]]s have a jewelled cross attached to the front of their klobuks; Russian Metropolitans wear a white klobuk with jewelled cross. Several Orthodox [[Patriarch]]s wear a rounded headcovering called a [[koukoulion]].\n\n[[Priest]]s who have been awarded a [[pectoral cross]] wear it with their choir dress (these pectoral crosses are of several degrees: silver, gold, or jewelled). Bishops wear a ''[[panagia]]'' ([[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]]) in place of the pectoral cross. Archbishops may wear a pectoral cross and a panagia. All [[primate (bishop)|primates]] and some bishops below primatial rank have the dignity of wearing an ''[[enkolpion]]'' (icon of Christ), a pectoral cross, and a panagia.\n\nA ruling Igumen (so long as he is inside his own monastery) and a bishop may carry his ''[[paterissa]]'' (crozier) when he is in church. However, the paterissa is never to be carried inside the sanctuary; instead, when he goes into the [[altar]], the paterissa is either handed to an [[altar server]] or left leaning against the [[iconostasis]] outside the [[Holy Doors]].\n\nIn North America and Great Britain, some Orthodox clergy have begun to wear a [[Roman collar]] ([[clergy shirt]]), though this is discouraged among the more traditional Orthodox.\n\n====Examples====\n\nThere exist color and design variations in each [[autocephalous]] Church, but these diagrams give some examples of Eastern Orthodox choir dress vestments:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Patriarch - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Metropolitan - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Bishop - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Greek Orthodox Bishop - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Patriarch (Slavic)\n|Metropolitan (Slavic)\n|Bishop (Slavic)\n|Bishop (Greek)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Priest - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Hieromonk - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Schemamonk - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Monk - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Reader - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Priest\n|Hieromonk\n|Schemamonk\n|Monk\n|Reader/Subdeacon/Deacon\n|}\n\n===Oriental Orthodox===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Patriarch.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Bishop.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Coptic Orthodox Priest.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Priest.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Priest-Monk.png|center|150px]]\n|-\n|Syriac Patriarch\n|Syriac Bishop\n|Coptic Priest\n|Syriac Priest\n|Syriac Priest <br> (monk)\n|}\n\nIn the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], married priests wear a black [[Kippah|skullcap]], or ''phiro'', while monastic priests wear the [[Great Schema|schema]], ''eskimo''.

It differs from the [[vestment]]s worn by the celebrants of the Eucharist, being normally made of fabrics such as wool, cotton or silk, as opposed to the fine [[brocade]]s used in vestments. It may also be worn by lay assistants such as acolytes and choirs.  It was abandoned by most of the Churches which originated in the sixteenth-century [[Reformation]].<ref name=\"tsol1\">Grisebrooke, W. Jardine. '''Vestments''' in Jones, Cheslyn, Wainright, Geoffrey & Yarnold, Edward. ''The Study of Liturgy'' SPCK: 1979, p.489</ref>\n\nLike [[vestments|Eucharistic vestments]] it derived originally from the formal secular dress of the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian era which survived in church usage after fashion had changed.<ref name=\"tsol1\"/>\n\nChoir dress also differs from \"house dress\" which is worn outside of a liturgical context (whether in the house or on the street). House dress may be either formal or informal.\n\n==Roman Catholic choir dress==\nChoir dress in the [[Catholic Church]] is worn by deacons, priests, regular prelates, bishops and cardinals when presiding at or celebrating a [[liturgy]] that is not the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], especially the [[Liturgy of the Hours]].\nBefore the Second Vatican Council the dress was more elaborate, and had dozens of varieties and colours. After The Second Vatican Council, it was reduced, however exceptions are sometimes granted for cathedral chapters.\n\nThe current dress is worn when attending Mass without celebrating or observing the Eucharist. It is worn by seminarians, instituted lectors and acolytes, and altar servers and choir members at Mass or other liturgical events.\n\nThe basic components of choir dress are:\n* the [[cassock]], with or without [[fascia (vestment)|fascia]] (fringed sash worn around the waist),\n* if the person is a brother or priest in a [[religious order]] that has its own [[religious habit|habit]] ([[Benedictines]], [[Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], etc.), the habit is worn in place of the cassock,\n* the [[surplice]] (or [[rochet]] if the wearer is a [[bishop]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], or [[canon (priest)|canon]]), and\n* the [[biretta]] (optional for secular priests unless their bishop requires its use, in which case it is mandatory).\n\nFor [[seminarian]]s, [[deacon]]s, and [[priest]]s the cassock is exactly the same as their normal cassock: a black cassock with black buttons, girded with a black fascia.\n\nPriests who hold additional honors may wear a different cassock: [[Chaplain of His Holiness|Chaplains of His Holiness]] wear a black cassock with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while [[Honorary Prelate]]s and [[Protonotary apostolic|Protonotaries apostolic]] wear a [[purple]] cassock with [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] piping and buttons with a purple fascia. A black cassock with [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress (academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic. [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] may wear the [[rochet]] (if the chapter has been granted usus rochetti by papal indult) with a distinctive [[mozzetta]], the particular colors of which are determined by the [[chapter (religion)|chapter]].\n\nBishops wear the above-mentioned purple cassock with scarlet piping, and add a [[pectoral cross]] suspended from a [[green]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] cord, a [[mozzetta]] over the rochet, and a purple [[zucchetto]] under the biretta. A [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] wears a [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] cassock with scarlet trim, pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the rochet, with a red zucchetto. The [[Pope]]'s choir dress includes a white cassock, rochet, red silk mozetta, red brocade stole and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.\n\nThe [[cope]] and/or [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] may be worn over choir dress when a cleric presides over a [[sacrament]] (for instance, at [[matrimony]], if not celebrated during Mass), or by the cleric presiding over prayers (for instance, the priest presiding at a solemn celebration of [[Vespers]] in the Liturgy of the Hours might wear cope and stole over choir dress, while other clergy present would wear simple choir dress of cassock and surplice).\n\nMonks who are neither deacons nor priests also have a form of choir dress: the full monastic habit with the monastic cowl forms their formal wear for attending the Liturgy of the Hours or Mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[File:Pope - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Cardinal - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Bishop - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Pope\n|Cardinal\n|Bishop\n|-\n|[[File:Higher Prelates of the Roman Curia and Protonotary Apostolic de numero - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Honorary Prelate and Apostolic Protonotary Supernumerary - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Chaplain of His Holiness - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Higher Prelates of the Roman Curia and<br>Apostolic protonotary ''de numero''\n|Apostolic protonotary supernumerary and<br>Honorary Prelate\n|Chaplain of His Holiness\n|-\n|[[File:Priest - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[[File:Canons - choir dresses.svg|center|470px]]\n|-\n|Priest or Deacon or Seminarian\n|colspan=\"2\"|Canon ([[Mozetta]] should be black, but can vary)\n|-\n|}\n\nSince 2006, priests of the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] have had their own choir dress, given to them by the Cardinal [[Archbishop of Florence]]. Their choir dress includes a rochet, a mozzetta, the cross of St. [[Francis de Sales]] on a blue and white ribbon, and a biretta with a blue pom. According to the Institute, \"The blue stands for our complete dedication to the [[Virgin Mary|Blessed Mother]] and is traditionally the color shown on St. Francis de Sales in most paintings of him,\" and \"The choir dress expresses the strong unity, spiritually, and identity of the Institute and adds solemnity to the [[Tridentine Mass|liturgy]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.institute-christ-king.org/institute/questions/ |accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Choir Dress (Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest).svg|400px|Canons, superiors and the prior general]]\n|-\n|Canons, superiors, and the prior general\n|-\n|}\n\n==Eastern choir dress==\n[[Image:Stjohn shanghai.png|thumb|right|200px|[[John (Maximovitch) of Shanghai and San Francisco|Saint John (Maximovich)]] wearing choir dress of an Orthodox bishop: [[klobuk]], [[outer riassa]], [[Panagia]], and episcopal [[mandyas]]; holding his [[paterissa]] (crozier).]]\n[[Image:By Grace of God, Ignatius Zakka I Iwas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]] (in red cassock) and a priest (in black).]]\nThe choir dress of clergy in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches are relatively similar. Over the inner [[cassock]] (''rasson'' or ''podrasnik''), a deep-sleeved ''[[cassock#Eastern practice (Orthodox)|exorason]]'' (''riassa''), which is often black, is worn. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], married clergy often wear grey, while monastic clergy wear black.  During the [[Easter|paschal]] season both monastic and married clergy will often wear a white inner cassock. Some Russian [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitans]] wear a white inner cassock and a blue outer when formally arriving to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\n===Byzantine Rite===\n\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy and [[Byzantine Catholic]]ism, [[monk]]s wear a black cloak, the ''[[mandyas]]'' over the outer cassock. The mandyas completely covers the monastic below the chin and reaches to the floor. In the Greek usage, the mandyas is usually only worn when performing certain liturgical roles; in the Slavic usage, all monks and [[nun]]s of the rank of [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism|Stavrophore]] or above wear the mandyas at every service, so long as they are in their own [[monastery]]. The mandyas of an [[hegumen]] ([[abbot]]) is of black silk, that of an [[archimandrite]] or [[bishop]] is of colored silk (specific usages will differ by jurisdiction), and has four square \"tablets\" on it: two at the neck and two at the feet. A bishop's mandyas additionally has \"rivers\" on it: three horizontal stripes either of gold (Greek practice) or red and white (Slavic practice).\n\nMonastic clergy wear different headcoverings than married clergy. Married clergy wear either a colored ''[[kamilavka|kalimaukion]]'' or ''[[skufia]]''; monastic clergy wear a black kalimaukion and [[Epanokamelavkion|veil]] (together known as the ''[[klobuk]]''). For monastics, the skufia is reserved for house dress, and the klobuk is worn in church. Russian [[archbishop]]s have a jewelled cross attached to the front of their klobuks; Russian Metropolitans wear a white klobuk with jewelled cross. Several Orthodox [[Patriarch]]s wear a rounded headcovering called a [[koukoulion]].\n\n[[Priest]]s who have been awarded a [[pectoral cross]] wear it with their choir dress (these pectoral crosses are of several degrees: silver, gold, or jewelled). Bishops wear a ''[[panagia]]'' ([[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]]) in place of the pectoral cross. Archbishops may wear a pectoral cross and a panagia. All [[primate (bishop)|primates]] and some bishops below primatial rank have the dignity of wearing an ''[[enkolpion]]'' (icon of Christ), a pectoral cross, and a panagia.\n\nA ruling Igumen (so long as he is inside his own monastery) and a bishop may carry his ''[[paterissa]]'' (crozier) when he is in church. However, the paterissa is never to be carried inside the sanctuary; instead, when he goes into the [[altar]], the paterissa is either handed to an [[altar server]] or left leaning against the [[iconostasis]] outside the [[Holy Doors]].\n\nIn North America and Great Britain, some Orthodox clergy have begun to wear a [[Roman collar]] ([[clergy shirt]]), though this is discouraged among the more traditional Orthodox.\n\n====Examples====\n\nThere exist color and design variations in each [[autocephalous]] Church, but these diagrams give some examples of Eastern Orthodox choir dress vestments:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Patriarch - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Metropolitan - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Bishop - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Greek Orthodox Bishop - choir dress.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Patriarch (Slavic)\n|Metropolitan (Slavic)\n|Bishop (Slavic)\n|Bishop (Greek)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Priest - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Hieromonk - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Slavic Orthodox Schemamonk - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Monk - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|[[File:Eastern Orthodox Reader - vestments.svg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Priest\n|Hieromonk\n|Schemamonk\n|Monk\n|Reader/Subdeacon/Deacon\n|}\n\n===Oriental Orthodox===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Patriarch.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Bishop.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Coptic Orthodox Priest.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Priest.png|center|150px]]\n|[[File:Syriac Orthodox Priest-Monk.png|center|150px]]\n|-\n|Syriac Patriarch\n|Syriac Bishop\n|Coptic Priest\n|Syriac Priest\n|Syriac Priest <br> (monk)\n|}\n\nIn the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], married priests wear a black [[Kippah|skullcap]], or ''phiro'', while monastic priests wear the [[Great Schema|schema]], ''eskimo''.
