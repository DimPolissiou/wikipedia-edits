Most stories attribute its creation to Lord Lamington's chef, the French-born Armand Galland, who was called upon at short notice to feed unexpected guests. Using only the limited ingredients available, Galland cut up some left-over [[French cuisine|French]] [[vanilla]] [[sponge cake]] baked the day before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in coconut. Impressed by Galland's creation, Lamington's guests were said to have later asked for the recipe.

Using only the limited ingredients available, Galland cut up some left-over [[French cuisine|French]] [[vanilla]] [[sponge cake]] baked the day before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in coconut. Impressed by Galland's creation, Lamington's guests were said to have later asked for the recipe.

After winning the first 2 games against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], Town failed to win the next 7 games in the league and Town's league form never seemed to truly recover during the season.\n\nTheir [[Football League Cup]] campaign during the season is currently the best in Town's history. Following wins in the earlier rounds against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], Town played 1st Division [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the semi-finals of the competition. Following a narrow 3-2 defeat at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] in the first leg, some were thinking that a trip to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] wasn't out of the question. [[Tony Leighton]] gave Town an early lead in the second leg at [[Leeds Road]], but the Gunners scored 3 further goals to secure their final berth at Town's expense. Town finished their league campaign in 14th place with only 38 points.\n\n==Squad at the end of the season==\n{{Football squad start}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Ireland        | pos=GK | name= [[John Oldfield (footballer)|John Oldfield]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Trevor Cherry]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Roy Ellam]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Billy Legg]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Ireland        | pos=DF | name= [[Mick Meagan]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Wales          | pos=DF | name= [[Ray Mielczarek]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Alex Smith (footballer born 1947)|Alex Smith]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Colin Dobson]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Mike Hellawell]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Brian Hill (footballer born 1942)|Brian Hill]]}}\n{{football squad mid}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Scotland       | pos=MF | name= [[Jimmy McGill (footballer, born 1946)|Jimmy McGill]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Northern Ireland | pos=MF | name= [[Jimmy Nicholson]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Steve Smith (footballer born 1946)|Steve Smith]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[Paul Aimson]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[John Archer (footballer, born 1941)|John Archer]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Scotland       | pos=FW | name= [[Joe Harper (footballer)|Joe Harper]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[Bobby Hoy]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[David Shaw (footballer, born 1948)|David Shaw]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[Frank Worthington]]}}\n{{football squad end}}\n\n==Results==\n\n=== [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; font-size:smaller;\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f6ff;\"\n!'''Date'''\n!'''Opponents'''\n!'''Home/<br>Away'''\n!'''Result<br>F -

After winning the first 2 games against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], Town failed to win the next 7 games in the league and Town's league form never seemed to truly recover during the season.\n\nTheir [[Football League Cup]] campaign during the season is currently the best in Town's history. Following wins in the earlier rounds against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], Town played 1st Division [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the semi-finals of the competition. Following a narrow 3-2 defeat at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] in the first leg, some were thinking that a trip to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] wasn't out of the question. [[Tony Leighton]] gave Town an early lead in the second leg at [[Leeds Road]], but the Gunners scored 3 further goals to secure their final berth at Town's expense. Town finished their league campaign in 14th place with only 38 points.\n\n==Squad at the end of the season==\n{{Football squad start}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Ireland        | pos=GK | name= [[John Oldfield (footballer)|John Oldfield]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Trevor Cherry]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Roy Ellam]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Billy Legg]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Ireland        | pos=DF | name= [[Mick Meagan]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Wales          | pos=DF | name= [[Ray Mielczarek]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=DF | name= [[Alex Smith (footballer born 1947)|Alex Smith]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Colin Dobson]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Mike Hellawell]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Brian Hill (footballer born 1942)|Brian Hill]]}}\n{{football squad mid}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Scotland       | pos=MF | name= [[Jimmy McGill (footballer, born 1946)|Jimmy McGill]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Northern Ireland | pos=MF | name= [[Jimmy Nicholson]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=MF | name= [[Steve Smith (footballer born 1946)|Steve Smith]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[Paul Aimson]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[John Archer (footballer)|John Archer]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=Scotland       | pos=FW | name= [[Joe Harper (footballer)|Joe Harper]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[Bobby Hoy]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[David Shaw (footballer, born 1948)|David Shaw]]}}\n{{football squad player | no=-- | nat=England        | pos=FW | name= [[Frank Worthington]]}}\n{{football squad end}}\n\n==Results==\n\n=== [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; font-size:smaller;\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f6ff;\"\n!'''Date'''\n!'''Opponents'''\n!'''Home/<br>Away'''\n!'''Result<br>F -

Alongside competing in the Third Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]] and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].\n\n[[Neil Franklin]]'s first full season in charge saw an influx of new players, with 14 new arrivals at [[Layer Road]] replacing a host of experienced players, including former apprentice [[Peter Wright (footballer, born 1934)|Peter Wright]] and experienced [[wing half]] [[Roy McCrohan]]. As such, Colchester's form suffered and the club battled against relegation for much of the season. They were eventually relegated after finishing in 23rd-position.\n\nColchester's fortunes in the cup competitions were no better than the league. They experienced early exits in each cup, twice being eliminated by [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]].\n\n==Season overview==\nWith manager [[Neil Franklin]] looking to make his mark on the Colchester first-team, [[Roy McCrohan]], [[Keith Rutter]] and [[Peter Wright (footballer, born 1934)|Peter Wright]] all left the club, and 14 new players arrived across the season. The biggest surprise to United fans was when Wright was not named on the retained list for the season. The former apprentice who had spent his entire career as a part-time professional with Colchester had scored 99 goals in 453 league and cup matches.\n\nHaving already sold one half of the previously prolific strike force of [[Bobby Hunt (footballer, born 1942)|Bobby Hunt]] and [[Martyn King]] when Hunt left for [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] earlier in 1964, Franklin sold King to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in October of the same year, and without their goals, a season of struggle ensued. Colchester could only manage 50 league goals across the season.\n\nFranklin's first-ever signing, [[Derek Trevis]], was an ever-present during the season, as was [[Duncan Forbes (footballer)|Duncan Forbes]], while [[Billy Stark (footballer, born 1937)|Billy Stark]] ended the season as top scorer with 14 league and cup goals. It was an injury-plagued season for Colchester, with [[Barrie Aitchison]], [[Mike Grice]], Martyn King, [[Gareth Salisbury]] and Billy Stark all ruled out as early as September, meaning Franklin had to call upon [[Noel Kearney]], a former [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] player who had been released by the club three months earlier. Kearney signed on a month-long trial and played three games for Colchester, all of which ended in defeat.\n\nColchester were relegated back to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] with Franklin having already been handed a year's contract extension mid-season. Average attendance hit an all-time low figure of 3,634 and the Supporter's Club could only muster 997 members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cu-fc.com/news/article/history-1950s-and-1960s-230131.aspx

Alongside competing in the Third Division, the club also participated in the [[FA Cup]] and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].\n\n[[Neil Franklin]]'s first full season in charge saw an influx of new players, with 14 new arrivals at [[Layer Road]] replacing a host of experienced players, including former apprentice [[Peter Wright (footballer, born 1934)|Peter Wright]] and experienced [[wing half]] [[Roy McCrohan]]. As such, Colchester's form suffered and the club battled against relegation for much of the season. They were eventually relegated after finishing in 23rd-position.\n\nColchester's fortunes in the cup competitions were no better than the league. They experienced early exits in each cup, twice being eliminated by [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]].\n\n==Season overview==\nWith manager [[Neil Franklin]] looking to make his mark on the Colchester first-team, [[Roy McCrohan]], [[Keith Rutter]] and [[Peter Wright (footballer, born 1934)|Peter Wright]] all left the club, and 14 new players arrived across the season. The biggest surprise to United fans was when Wright was not named on the retained list for the season. The former apprentice who had spent his entire career as a part-time professional with Colchester had scored 99 goals in 453 league and cup matches.\n\nHaving already sold one half of the previously prolific strike force of [[Bobby Hunt (footballer, born 1942)|Bobby Hunt]] and [[Martyn King]] when Hunt left for [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] earlier in 1964, Franklin sold King to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in October of the same year, and without their goals, a season of struggle ensued. Colchester could only manage 50 league goals across the season.\n\nFranklin's first-ever signing, [[Derek Trevis]], was an ever-present during the season, as was [[Duncan Forbes (footballer)|Duncan Forbes]], while [[Billy Stark (footballer, born 1937)|Billy Stark]] ended the season as top scorer with 14 league and cup goals. It was an injury-plagued season for Colchester, with [[Barrie Aitchison]], [[Mike Grice]], Martyn King, [[Gareth Salisbury]] and Billy Stark all ruled out as early as September, meaning Franklin had to call upon [[Noel Kearney]], a former [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] player who had been released by the club three months earlier. Kearney signed on a month-long trial and played three games for Colchester, all of which ended in defeat.\n\nColchester were relegated back to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] with Franklin having already been handed a year's contract extension mid-season. Average attendance hit an all-time low figure of 3,634 and the Supporter's Club could only muster 997 members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cu-fc.com/news/article/history-1950s-and-1960s-230131.aspx

Specifically, the deaths of individuals such as [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], [[Death of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]], and [[Shooting of Tamir Rice|Tamir Rice]] sparked a need for the conference among the African-American community. During the three day conference (July 24\u201326), activists participated in discussions, viewed short films, and engaged in workshops designed to mobilize individuals seeking to find solutions to the problems that black communities face. The [[Cleveland State University]] convention is considered the first major gathering of the Movement for Black Lives as more than 1500 individuals attended the conference. Subsequently, activists from the convention embarked on a mission to establish the official Movement for Black Lives organization as well as establish a policy platform that could guide activists from around the country in their fight to end police brutality and discrimination against blacks within the United States.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standingonthesideoflove.org/ourstories/a-transformative-experience|title=The Movement For Black Lives Convening In Cleveland\u2014A Transformative Experience|work=Standing on the Side of Love|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe conference gained even more national media attention when, on the last day of the convention, a Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA) officer maced a crowd of primarily African-American activists just blocks away from [[Cleveland State University]]. The crowd had gathered in response to an RTA officer's detention of an African-American teen for intoxication. According to authorities, the teenager was unable to \"care for himself\" due to his level of intoxication, and thus the authorities thought it was necessary to take him into custody. During the teenager's detention a crowd gathered around the police cruiser to protest the detention of the teen; in order to clear the crowd from the path of the police cruiser, \"a Transit Police officer used a general burst of pepper spray\" directed toward the activists. The incident drew criticism as interest groups, such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU of Ohio]], believed \"the use of pepper spray by law enforcement as a means of crowd control is questionable.\"<ref>\"ACLU Questions RTA Police Pepper Spray Incident at Close of Movement for Black Lives Convening.\"'' Targeted News Service'', Jul 30, 2015'', ProQuest Newsstand; Research Library.''</ref><ref>Yang, Jessica. \"RTA Officer Pepper Sprays Movement for Black Lives Gathering at CSU.\"'' University Wire'', Jul 30, 2015'', ProQuest Newsstand.''</ref><ref>Larimer, Sarah.

In 2016, professional football player [[Colin Kaepernick]] elected to sit during the playing of the national anthem at an [[National Football League|NFL]] football game.

The four NBA stars saw it as an opportunity to bring individuals on both sides of the Movement for Black Lives together; former [[Miami Heat]] shooting guard, Dwyane Wade stated, \"Racial profiling has to stop... but also the retaliation has to stop. Enough is enough.\" The group further encouraged Americans to \"renounce all violence,\" and instead, focus their efforts on rebuilding the divided communities within America.<ref>Bieler, D. (2016).

Following the publishing of the Movement for Black Lives' platform, many interest groups issued a public response either condemning or supporting the movement's objectives.\n\nSome Jewish and \"pro-Israel\" organizations expressed strong objections to the platform's statements on Israel, particularly its use of the word \"genocide\" to describe Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/black-lives-matters-movement-palestine-platform-israel-critics \"Critics denounce Black Lives Matter platform accusing Israel of 'genocide'\"], The Guardian.</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.735412 \"Jewish Groups Condemn Black Lives Matter Platform for Accusing 'Apartheid' Israel of 'Genocide'\"] Ha'aretz, Aug 05, 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/mailbag/churches-reject-black-lives-matter-s-platform-on-israel/article_42a99819-8231-572f-83d1-82d7a753a8f8.html \"Churches reject Black Lives Matter's platform on Israel\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Black-Lives-Matter-author-defends-genocide-accusation-toward-Israel-463709 \"Black Lives Matter author defends platform accusing Israel of 'genocide'\"] Jerusalem Post 08/10/2016</ref><ref>[http://972mag.com/the-black-lives-matter-platform-how-the-jewish-community-got-distracted-by-one-word/121177/ \"The Black Lives Matter platform: How the Jewish community got distracted by one word\"], Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, August 5, 2016.</ref> Prominent Jewish  organizations, such as the Global Jewish Advocacy organization (AJC), further condemned the Movement for Black Lives' for what it deemed an inaccurate representation of the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the MBL platform labeled Israel as an \"apartheid state.\"<ref name=\":0\">AJC: Movement for black lives disparages jews, israel.

According to the Global Jewish Advocacy organization, \"MBL identifies itself with a cause that, beyond undermining the effort to advance peace between Israelis and Palestinians, is fundamentally grounded in denial of the very legitimacy of the Jewish state.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile the Movement for Black Lives has received extensive criticism for its platform and objectives, there has also been widespread support for the movement. Organizations such as the [[National Council of Asian Pacific Americans]], [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU of Northern California]], and even the [[National Council of Jewish Women]] showed support for the Movement for Black Lives by issuing public statements following the movement's controversial publication of its platform. The Movement for Black Lives' call for criminal justice reform and the end of police brutality resonated with many advocacy groups. In one statement, the National Council of Jewish Women stated, \"NCJW affirms that Black lives matter, including Jews of color, who are a vital part of both the Jewish and our NCJW community.

One of the primary goals of the Movement for Black Lives is to promote a democracy that is more representative of black communities in America. Various political organizations have stood in solidarity with MBL because, according to \"[[Democracy for America]],\" it is seen as \"an ideal catalyst for the substantive, results-oriented conversations the current and future leaders of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] must have with the communities they serve.\"<ref name=\":3\">\"Democracy for America Endorses Movement for Black Lives Policy Platform; For Editor Vail (speech).\" ''Targeted News Service'', 7 Dec. 2016.

He wrote that although the platform has \"thousands of words that address both comprehensively and in great detail what it would take to fully end the legacy of slavery and the constant resurgence of racism\", a single paragraph \"and especially one word in it\u2014'genocide'\" has grabbed the attention of the American Jewish community. Waskow wrote that the specific allegations in the paragraph concerning \"the Israeli government's behavior and its effects in the US are largely accurate BUT\u2014factually, it is not true that the State of Israel has committed, is committing, genocide upon the Palestinian people.\" He added, \"Oppression, yes.

During the three day conference (July 24\u201326), activists participated in discussions, viewed short films, and engaged in workshops designed to mobilize individuals seeking to find solutions to the problems that black communities face. The [[Cleveland State University]] convention is considered the first major gathering of the Movement for Black Lives as more than 1500 individuals attended the conference.

The Movement for Black Lives' call for criminal justice reform and the end of police brutality resonated with many advocacy groups.
