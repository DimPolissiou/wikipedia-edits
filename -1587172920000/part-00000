His parents are unknown and he has few known relatives.  He has a sister, and also claims (like many other kender) to have an Uncle Trapspringer.  He has three uncles, by the names of Remo Lockpick, Bertie, and Wilfre.  He also has a cousin, Latchlifter Furrfoot.\n\n==Publication history==\n''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine introduced some of the [[Heroes of the Lance]] in a series of short stories, as a preview to the Dragonlance story; \"A Stone's Throw Away\" in ''Dragon'' #85 (May 1984) was the second of these, and is a story about Tasslehoff.<ref name=\"Dragon85\"/>\n\nIn the novel ''[[Kendermore]]'', Tasslehoff is \"collared by a lady bounty hunter and charged with violating the kender laws of prearranged marriage. To ensure his return, Kendermore's council has his Uncle Trapspringer in prison. Tas meets the last woolly mammoth and an alchemist who wants to pickle one of everything, including one kender. What no one knows is that the Dark Queen is inciting the riots in Kendermore as part of her plan for the battle of good versus evil.\"<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Kirchoff| first = Mary| authorlink = Mary Kirchoff| title = The Game Wizards|magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #141| page = 68| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=January 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nTasslehoff developed a passion for maps early on. He collected them and posted them all over the walls of his room. However, when he drew maps, his short patience led him to draw them inaccurately and make up names for certain places on [[Ansalon]].  While he often stole things, he always claimed he wasn't a thief, often saying he was just borrowing the objects in question. This is a behaviour typical to kender, who as a species steadfastly, and with some indignation, maintain they do not steal, but \"find\" things that \"just happen\" to have been left out, or fallen into their pouches.\n\nHe traveled to Solace and found a ring dropped by a thief, which he dubbed \"Tas's Ring of Teleportation\". With this ring, he traveled all across Krynn, ending up at Magus's Tower where he aided [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]] in an attempt to stop Magus from using demons. When he departed, he left Magus in the care of the Prince of Demons.\n\nDuring Tas's travels outside of Solace, he encountered [[Tanis Half-Elven]] and [[Flint Fireforge]]. He asked to be their friends; they declined. Tas, upon leaving Solace, acquired a bracelet that Flint made for Selena Sonluanaau.  This bracelet saved Tas from a spider, and a merchant as well. When Tanis and Flint came to collect the bracelet Tas no longer had it. Selena arrived and charged them with finding the bracelet. They set off immediately, but were waylaid by [[Satyr (Dungeons & Dragons)|satyrs]], who made them stop, dance, and drink while the satyrs played music for a whole day. Upon arriving in Tantallon, Flint and Tanis were captured by the local Lord.  Selena and Tas took a [[Shapeshifting|polymorph]] potion that turned them into birds to get into the castle, then they became mice to retrieve the bracelet.  They freed Tanis and Flint, the bracelet was returned to Selena, and Tas left with Flint and Tanis.\n\nTasslehoff then joined the remaining [[Heroes of the Lance|Companions]] and they began adventuring. Flint nearly drowned at one point, and Tas helped to get him ashore. When Tas was on a quest for a special herb that [[Raistlin Majere|Raistlin]] needed, along with [[Sturm Brightblade|Sturm]] and [[Caramon Majere|Caramon]], he was captured by minotaurs.\n\nTasslehoff also appeared in the ''Legends Trilogy'' as a character to retrieve Caramon from his drunken stupor.\n\n==Back to Kendermore==\nWhen the companions separated, Tas had no intention of leaving his friends but a bounty hunter (who was a beautiful dwarven woman, and was later killed by the half-orc Denzil) came to arrest him and bring him back to Kendermore. She did this because he had to marry a kender named Damaris Metwinger (who was the mayor's daughter). His journey to Kendermore was forced upon him, by saying that his Uncle Trapspringer was arrested until Tas will come and marry. On the way Tas was kidnapped by two Gnomes, whose Life-Quest was to stuff one of every creature alive. He was rescued by a Woolly Mammoth he released (this later prompted endless stories he told to the other Heroes of the Lance, whether they wanted to hear them or not). He was then kidnapped by a half-orc named Denzil, who needed a map of Tas' to find a treasure located in The Ruins. The Ruins were the remnants of a city lost during the time of the Cataclysm, located just outside the kender city, Kendermore. When Tas reached The Ruins, he was captured by a friendly ogre. The ogre's lair was underneath one of the abandoned Towers of High Sorcery. In the Tower of High Sorcery he entered a dimension. The dimension where his Uncle Trapspringer and Damaris were on that anything and everything was edible. They escaped, along with the other kender caught there. Takhisis, finding an open portal, tried to enter the world, but they closed the portal before she could get in. In revenge, she asked her son, Nuitari, the god of dark magic, to cause natural disasters on Kendermore. When Tas and the rest of the kenders saved from the alternate dimension arrived in Kendermore, it was burning. However, thanks to Tas' leadership, they extinguished the fire. At the end Damaris decided to marry Trapspringer, thus freeing Tas from his obligation.\n\n==War of the Lance==\nTasslehoff helps his companions on many occasions during the war,<ref name=\"LZW\"/> mainly through his fearlessness and curiosity. While normally a nuisance, these qualities often help the Companions as well. Tasslehoff takes his part in the war by riding a dragon with Flint during one of the final battles. He is delighted at the chance of flying dragons and get excited easily, even in dangerous and deadly situations.  During the War of the Lance, Tasslehoff has numerous [[near-death experience]]s. In a draconian army encampment, he nearly dies in a burning wicker dragon. In the city of Tarsis the Beautiful, he nearly dies by a burning building falling on top of him. In the Temple of the Dark Queen in Neraka, Tasslehoff is poisoned by a trap sprung by a picked lock. He is later healed by Raistlin Majere.\n\nPaladine, leader of the white pantheon of gods in Dragonlance and brother to [[Takhisis]], becomes mortal and takes the form of a wizard named Fizban, who is very fond of kenders in general and Tasslehoff in particular, with the two developing a father and son relationship.{{sfn|Wolf|2010|p=14|ref=Wolf}}\n\n==After the war==\nAfter the war Tasslehoff splits up with the other Companions of the Lance, with the intention of going back to Kendermore. He went on to tell them the tale of how the kender killed a Dragon Highlord named Fewmaster Toede. Before leaving he told the companions that kenders would go down in Krynnish lore. The companions had to refrain from telling Tas that Fewmaster Toede was a hobgoblin with little more intelligence than a Gully Dwarf.\n\n==Legends==\nTasslehoff was sent by Tika Majere to help Caramon escort a cleric of Paladine, Crysania to the tower of High Sorcery. Anxious to keep his promise to protect Caramon and not miss out on any adventures, Tasslehoff, having been transformed into a mouse, manages to sneak into the laboratory of the great Par Salian, leader of the white robed magicians of Good, as he is casting the time traveling spell. Tasslehoff runs into the middle of the spell and gets transported back in time with Caramon. Since the creation of Kender was accidental, Kender possessed the ability to alter the flow of time. Through Tasslehoff's interference, Raistlin (as Fistandantilus) is able to change the past and successfully enter the Abyss to challenge [[Takhisis]] along with the Paladine cleric Crysania. Caramon and Tas, traveling back in time, end up in 358 instead of 356, discovering an alternate time line in which Raistlin has become a god, and the world is going to end. Armed with this knowledge, they go back in time again to 356, planning to stop Raistlin. Caramon orders Tas to save Tanis. Tas, knowing that Caramon will die if he tries to enters the Shoikan Grove, saves Tanis, and with his help, Tas saves Caramon. He then helps them when they capture the Flying Citadel, and controls it until the end of the war, when he gives it to Rounce. After hearing Crysania's eulogy for Elistan, he leaves to Tanis' castle with Tanis and Caramon.\n\n==Chaos War==\nIn order to force Chaos to part or remain on Krynn, the gods needed Chaos' blood, and so, at the end of the Chaos War Tasslehoff insulted Chaos, making the deity careless. Tasslehoff then ran up and stabbed Chaos in his big toe with a magical knife [[Caramon Majere]] had dubbed \"Rabbitslayer\". The resulting spurt of blood was enough of Chaos' essence to be used to force the deity into a choice\u2014stay in the world and be forced to continually control himself (which Chaos had little patience for), or leave. Chaos decided to leave, but while he was leaving, he stomped on Tasslehoff, seemingly killing him, but leaving his items.\n\n==War of Souls==\nBefore Tasslehoff was killed by Chaos, he used the magical time traveling device to go forward in time to speak at Caramon's funeral. The first time he attempted to attend the funeral, he arrived too late. On another attempt at arriving at the correct time, he managed to speak briefly. After this event, Tasslehoff went back, unintentionally, to a different time and participated in the War of Souls. There he met the knight Gerard, and the two embarked on a journey to [[Qualinesti]] to find the mage [[Palin Majere]] before separating. The third timeline he ever entered was the only one in which the Great Dragons reached Ansalon. By simply existing in this timeline that wasn't his own he was a danger to Takhisis. He was proof that her power wasn't absolute and inspired some individuals. Moreover, if he was slain in a time not his own, the result would be oblivion. Thus, he was unsuccessfully hunted by the Dark Knight, [[Mina (Dragonlance)|Mina]]. He was trapped for a time in the tower of high sorcery with the mages Palin and Dalamar, both of which wanted to send him back to die by using the Device of Time Journeying.<ref>Cannon, Peter (May 13, 2002). \"Dragons of a Vanished Moon: The War of Souls Volume Three\", ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' '''249''' (19): 56.</ref> However, the device had been broken earlier. Since he did not want to die, he fled with the device, which was later fixed by the gnome Conundrum. He traveled through several various times throughout history before he returned to the war of souls. Shortly after, he helped Gerard, Odila, and Mirror to free the metallic dragons from their prison. After this he agreed to go back in time and get stepped on by Chaos, as he was supposed to, thus returning to his normal time-stream. As he was leaving, he reminded Gerard that the lock on his tomb (which he had picklocked), was broken and needed repair.\n\nCoincidentally, many kender claim to have an ''Uncle Tas'' during the Fifth Age.\n\n==Personality==\nTas, like all kender of the Dragonlance series, could be compared to a 5-year-old child; he is utterly irresponsible in any task that is not of the utmost importance, and often takes things that do not belong to him, which to a kender is \"borrowing\" and not stealing. Kender do not consider themselves to be thieves, and can become quite indignant when accused of stealing. They believe in sharing all that they have, and a common custom between two kender is to dump the entire contents of their pouches and exchange things. To kender, a family heirloom is something that has been in their possession for more than three weeks.\n\nKender also have a trait called \"Taunting\", by insulting their opponents to the point of enraging them to killing intent, and thus lowering their accuracy in attacking but increasing their strength as a result. This is especially shown during Chronicles Book 2: ''[[Dragons of Winter Night]]'' when the companions were tied up and escorted to the mayor and while walking the street under the jeering of the crowd, Tas, as the master of taunting, managed to enrage the crowd into a riot and managed to be saved by the knights on covert mission in the chaos.\n\nLike all kender, Tas hated being bored, and on the occasion that he was, he was known to begin talking about meaningless things to anyone who would listen.\n\nLike all kender, Tas is completely without fear for himself. However, Tas is different from other kender in that he does know fear, not for himself, but for the people that he cares about. He is even immune to dragonfear, except that caused by the great dragons of the fourth age, but the Shoikan Grove's piercing aura of fear managed to break through and affect him, though he did not recognize the feeling. The Death Knight, Lord Soth, gave him the same feeling. He is also fiercely loyal to his friends, has enough sense (largely thanks to lecturing from [[Tanis Half-Elven]]) to avoid overly dangerous situations, and above all, has a conscience in the form of [[Flint Fireforge]]'s voice.\n\nDisplays of this fear can be found in the books:\n<BR>'''Chronicles Trilogy'''<BR>\n''Dragons of Autumn Twilight''<BR>\n''Dragons of Winter Night''<BR>\n''Dragons of Spring Dawning''<BR>\n''Dragons of Summer Flame''\n\n<BR>'''War of Souls Trilogy'''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Fallen Sun''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Lost Star''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Vanished Moon''\n\n==Appearance==\nTasslehoff is often described as resembling a twelve-year-old child; he is of that general height and build. His face has many wrinkles that appear whenever he smiles, which is often. His clothes are always described as colorful, comfortable, and utterly unmatching.  His most famous article of clothing was his fur-lined vest, worn through much of the War of Lance. Like all of his race, he carries a good number of pouches, which he never takes off, except just prior to his death at the hands of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], so that he could run faster. See [[Chaos War]]. Also like all of his race, he has a ludicrously large [[Man bun|topknot]], which is to a [[Kender (fantasy)|kender]] what a beard is to a dwarf. His hair is brown as are his eyes. He also embodies the statement in many of the novels, the two most dangerous things in all of Krynn is to hear a Kender say \"oops\" and \"I'm bored.\".\n\n==Other media==\n===Video games===\nTasslehoff appears as one of the player characters in ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine  | title =Fantasy Roleplaying: Heroes of the Lance  | format =review  |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]  | issue = 62  |page=71  | date =March 1989  | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue62/Pages/Crash6200071.jpg  | issn =0954-8661  | accessdate = March 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nTasslehoff also appears as a player character in ''[[Dragons of Flame (video game)|Dragons of Flame]]'', where one reviewer describes him as \"a rather fat mamma with ginormous ears\".<ref>{{cite journal  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Dragons of Flame  | format = review  | journal =[[Your Sinclair]]  | volume =  | issue = 58  |page=82  | publisher =  | date =October 1990  | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue58/Pages/YourSinclair5800082.jpg  | doi =  | issn =0269-6983  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Miniature figures===\nTasslehoff was included in [[Ral Partha]]'s ''Dragonlance Heroes'' boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine felt that Ral Partha did a good job of matching their figures to the characters' descriptions in the books, and described his figure: \"Tasslehoff stands at the ready, with a sling in his left hand and a rock in his right. He is clothed in simple pants and buckle boots, and is wearing a sleeveless fur coat. His face has a look of foreboding. His hair is pulled back into a topknot that flows down his back.

His parents are unknown and he has few known relatives.  He has a sister, and also claims (like many other kender) to have an Uncle Trapspringer.  He has three uncles, by the names of Remo Lockpick, Bertie, and Wilfre.  He also has a cousin, Latchlifter Furrfoot.\n\n==Publication history==\n''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine introduced some of the [[Heroes of the Lance]] in a series of short stories, as a preview to the Dragonlance story; \"A Stone's Throw Away\" in ''Dragon'' #85 (May 1984) was the second of these, and is a story about Tasslehoff.<ref name=\"Dragon85\"/>\n\nIn the novel ''[[Kendermore]]'', Tasslehoff is \"collared by a lady bounty hunter and charged with violating the kender laws of prearranged marriage. To ensure his return, Kendermore's council has his Uncle Trapspringer in prison. Tas meets the last woolly mammoth and an alchemist who wants to pickle one of everything, including one kender. What no one knows is that the Dark Queen is inciting the riots in Kendermore as part of her plan for the battle of good versus evil.\"<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Kirchoff| first = Mary| authorlink = Mary Kirchoff| title = The Game Wizards|magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #141| page = 68| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=January 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nTasslehoff developed a passion for maps early on. He collected them and posted them all over the walls of his room. However, when he drew maps, his short patience led him to draw them inaccurately and make up names for certain places on [[Ansalon]].  While he often stole things, he always claimed he wasn't a thief, often saying he was just borrowing the objects in question. This is a behaviour typical to kender, who as a species steadfastly, and with some indignation, maintain they do not steal, but \"find\" things that \"just happen\" to have been left out, or fallen into their pouches.\n\nHe traveled to Solace and found a ring dropped by a thief, which he dubbed \"Tas's Ring of Teleportation\". With this ring, he traveled all across Krynn, ending up at Magus's Tower where he aided [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]] in an attempt to stop Magus from using demons. When he departed, he left Magus in the care of the Prince of Demons.\n\nDuring Tas's travels outside of Solace, he encountered [[Tanis Half-Elven]] and [[Flint Fireforge]]. He asked to be their friends; they declined. Tas, upon leaving Solace, acquired a bracelet that Flint made for Selena Sonluanaau.  This bracelet saved Tas from a spider, and a merchant as well. When Tanis and Flint came to collect the bracelet Tas no longer had it. Selena arrived and charged them with finding the bracelet. They set off immediately, but were waylaid by [[Satyr (Dungeons & Dragons)|satyrs]], who made them stop, dance, and drink while the satyrs played music for a whole day. Upon arriving in Tantallon, Flint and Tanis were captured by the local Lord.  Selena and Tas took a [[Shapeshifting|polymorph]] potion that turned them into birds to get into the castle, then they became mice to retrieve the bracelet.  They freed Tanis and Flint, the bracelet was returned to Selena, and Tas left with Flint and Tanis.\n\nTasslehoff then joined the remaining [[Heroes of the Lance|Companions]] and they began adventuring. Flint nearly drowned at one point, and Tas helped to get him ashore. When Tas was on a quest for a special herb that [[Raistlin Majere|Raistlin]] needed, along with [[Sturm Brightblade|Sturm]] and [[Caramon Majere|Caramon]], he was captured by minotaurs.\n\nTasslehoff also appeared in the ''Legends Trilogy'' as a character to retrieve Caramon from his drunken stupor.\n\n==Back to Kendermore==\nWhen the companions separated, Tas had no intention of leaving his friends but a bounty hunter (who was a beautiful dwarven woman, and was later killed by the half-orc Denzil) came to arrest him and bring him back to Kendermore. She did this because he had to get married to a kender named Damaris Metwinger (who was the mayor's daughter). His journey to Kendermore was forced upon him, by saying that his Uncle Trapspringer was arrested until Tas will come and marry. On the way Tas was kidnapped by two Gnomes, whose Life-Quest was to stuff one of every creature alive. He was rescued by a Woolly Mammoth he released (this later prompted endless stories he told to the other Heroes of the Lance, whether they wanted to hear them or not). He was then kidnapped by a half-orc named Denzil, who needed a map of Tas' to find a treasure located in The Ruins. The Ruins were the remnants of a city lost during the time of the Cataclysm, located just outside the kender city, Kendermore. When Tas reached The Ruins, he was captured by a friendly ogre. The ogre's lair was underneath one of the abandoned Towers of High Sorcery. In the Tower of High Sorcery he entered a dimension. The dimension where his Uncle Trapspringer and Damaris were on that anything and everything was edible. They escaped, along with the other kender caught there. Takhisis, finding an open portal, tried to enter the world, but they closed the portal before she could get in. In revenge, she asked her son, Nuitari, the god of dark magic, to cause natural disasters on Kendermore. When Tas and the rest of the kenders saved from the alternate dimension arrived in Kendermore, it was burning. However, thanks to Tas' leadership, they extinguished the fire. At the end Damaris decided to marry Trapspringer, thus freeing Tas from his obligation.\n\n==War of the Lance==\nTasslehoff helps his companions on many occasions during the war,<ref name=\"LZW\"/> mainly through his fearlessness and curiosity. While normally a nuisance, these qualities often help the Companions as well. Tasslehoff takes his part in the war by riding a dragon with Flint during one of the final battles. He is delighted at the chance of flying dragons and get excited easily, even in dangerous and deadly situations.  During the War of the Lance, Tasslehoff has numerous [[near-death experience]]s. In a draconian army encampment, he nearly dies in a burning wicker dragon. In the city of Tarsis the Beautiful, he nearly dies by a burning building falling on top of him. In the Temple of the Dark Queen in Neraka, Tasslehoff is poisoned by a trap sprung by a picked lock. He is later healed by Raistlin Majere.\n\nPaladine, leader of the white pantheon of gods in Dragonlance and brother to [[Takhisis]], becomes mortal and takes the form of a wizard named Fizban, who is very fond of kenders in general and Tasslehoff in particular, with the two developing a father and son relationship.{{sfn|Wolf|2010|p=14|ref=Wolf}}\n\n==After the war==\nAfter the war Tasslehoff splits up with the other Companions of the Lance, with the intention of going back to Kendermore. He went on to tell them the tale of how the kender killed a Dragon Highlord named Fewmaster Toede. Before leaving he told the companions that kenders would go down in Krynnish lore. The companions had to refrain from telling Tas that Fewmaster Toede was a hobgoblin with little more intelligence than a Gully Dwarf.\n\n==Legends==\nTasslehoff was sent by Tika Majere to help Caramon escort a cleric of Paladine, Crysania to the tower of High Sorcery. Anxious to keep his promise to protect Caramon and not miss out on any adventures, Tasslehoff, having been transformed into a mouse, manages to sneak into the laboratory of the great Par Salian, leader of the white robed magicians of Good, as he is casting the time traveling spell. Tasslehoff runs into the middle of the spell and gets transported back in time with Caramon. Since the creation of Kender was accidental, Kender possessed the ability to alter the flow of time. Through Tasslehoff's interference, Raistlin (as Fistandantilus) is able to change the past and successfully enter the Abyss to challenge [[Takhisis]] along with the Paladine cleric Crysania. Caramon and Tas, traveling back in time, end up in 358 instead of 356, discovering an alternate time line in which Raistlin has become a god, and the world is going to end. Armed with this knowledge, they go back in time again to 356, planning to stop Raistlin. Caramon orders Tas to save Tanis. Tas, knowing that Caramon will die if he tries to enters the Shoikan Grove, saves Tanis, and with his help, Tas saves Caramon. He then helps them when they capture the Flying Citadel, and controls it until the end of the war, when he gives it to Rounce. After hearing Crysania's eulogy for Elistan, he leaves to Tanis' castle with Tanis and Caramon.\n\n==Chaos War==\nIn order to force Chaos to part or remain on Krynn, the gods needed Chaos' blood, and so, at the end of the Chaos War Tasslehoff insulted Chaos, making the deity careless. Tasslehoff then ran up and stabbed Chaos in his big toe with a magical knife [[Caramon Majere]] had dubbed \"Rabbitslayer\". The resulting spurt of blood was enough of Chaos' essence to be used to force the deity into a choice\u2014stay in the world and be forced to continually control himself (which Chaos had little patience for), or leave. Chaos decided to leave, but while he was leaving, he stomped on Tasslehoff, seemingly killing him, but leaving his items.\n\n==War of Souls==\nBefore Tasslehoff was killed by Chaos, he used the magical time traveling device to go forward in time to speak at Caramon's funeral. The first time he attempted to attend the funeral, he arrived too late. On another attempt at arriving at the correct time, he managed to speak briefly. After this event, Tasslehoff went back, unintentionally, to a different time and participated in the War of Souls. There he met the knight Gerard, and the two embarked on a journey to [[Qualinesti]] to find the mage [[Palin Majere]] before separating. The third timeline he ever entered was the only one in which the Great Dragons reached Ansalon. By simply existing in this timeline that wasn't his own he was a danger to Takhisis. He was proof that her power wasn't absolute and inspired some individuals. Moreover, if he was slain in a time not his own, the result would be oblivion. Thus, he was unsuccessfully hunted by the Dark Knight, [[Mina (Dragonlance)|Mina]]. He was trapped for a time in the tower of high sorcery with the mages Palin and Dalamar, both of which wanted to send him back to die by using the Device of Time Journeying.<ref>Cannon, Peter (May 13, 2002). \"Dragons of a Vanished Moon: The War of Souls Volume Three\", ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' '''249''' (19): 56.</ref> However, the device had been broken earlier. Since he did not want to die, he fled with the device, which was later fixed by the gnome Conundrum. He traveled through several various times throughout history before he returned to the war of souls. Shortly after, he helped Gerard, Odila, and Mirror to free the metallic dragons from their prison. After this he agreed to go back in time and get stepped on by Chaos, as he was supposed to, thus returning to his normal time-stream. As he was leaving, he reminded Gerard that the lock on his tomb (which he had picklocked), was broken and needed repair.\n\nCoincidentally, many kender claim to have an ''Uncle Tas'' during the Fifth Age.\n\n==Personality==\nTas, like all kender of the Dragonlance series, could be compared to a 5-year-old child; he is utterly irresponsible in any task that is not of the utmost importance, and often takes things that do not belong to him, which to a kender is \"borrowing\" and not stealing.

Roberts notes comments that had recently been made by the editors of the [[Egerton Gospel]] (P.Egerton 2); and says similarly it could be said of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> that it \"has a somewhat informal air about it and with no claims to fine writing is yet a careful piece of work\".<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 17\">Roberts(1935), p. 17.</ref>\n\nIn total, 114 legible letters are visible on the two sides of the fragment, representing 18 out of the 24 letters of the [[Greek Alphabet]];<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref> beta, zeta, xi, phi, chi, and psi being missing.  Roberts noted that the writing is painstaking and rather laboured, with instances of individual letters formed using several strokes \"with a rather clumsy effect\" (e.g. the sigma '''\u03a3''' at line three of the recto, and the eta '''H''' immediately following it).<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 13\">Roberts(1935), p. 13.</ref> Several letters are inclined to stray away from the notional upper and lower writing lines.<ref name=\"Hurtado, p. 11\">Hurtado, p. 11.</ref> Another peculiarity is that there are two distinct forms of the letter alpha '''\u0391''';<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 15\">Roberts(1935), p. 15.</ref> most are formed from a separate loop and diagonal stroke, where the top of the stroke has a distinctive decorative arch while the bottom is hooked; but on the fourth line of the verso there is a smaller alpha formed by a single spiralling loop with no arch or hooks. Also present in two forms is the letter upsilon '''\u03a5'''; the more common form is constructed from two strokes, each stroke terminating in a decorative hook or finial (see the second line of the recto); but on the fourth line of the verso is an upsilon formed from a single looped stroke with no decoration.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref> These observations support Roberts's supposition that the scribe was an educated person writing carefully in imitation of a calligraphic hand, rather than a professional scribe writing to order; such that, on occasion, the writer inadvertently reverted to the undecorated (and often smaller) letter forms of his everyday hand.\n\nRoberts noted that in addition to alpha and upsilon, other letters also tend to be given decorative hooks, especially iota '''\u0399''' and omega '''\u03a9''' (both seen in the seventh line of the recto).<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 13\">Roberts(1935), p. 13.</ref>  He also drew attention to the forms of epsilon '''\u0395''' (with an extended cross-stroke a little above the centre-line, as in the fourth line of the verso), delta '''\u0394''' (with a decorative arch, as in the first and second lines of the recto) and mu '''\u039c''' (with a central stroke dipping down to the baseline, as in the third line of the recto).<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 13\">Roberts(1935), p. 13.</ref>  Nongbri confirms Roberts observations, and also notes distinctive forms of rho '''\u03a1''' (with a small head and an undecorated downstroke extending well below the lower line, as in the second line of the verso),<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref> pi '''\u03a0''' (with an extended horizontal stroke, as in the third line of the recto)<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 33\">Nongbri, p. 33.</ref> and kappa '''\u039a''' (formed like the looped upsilon with an additional downwards stroke, as in the fourth line of the recto).<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref>  Aside from their sometimes clumsy construction, the sigma and eta are also distinctive in form; the sigma facing fully to the right, and the eta having a distinctive high cross stroke.\n\nIn 1977, Roberts surveyed fourteen papyri believed to be of Christian origin, twelve codices and two scrolls; comprising all the Christian manuscripts then commonly assessed as likely having a second century date including <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>. He considered that only three of these texts had a calligraphic bookhand, such as was then standard in formal manuscripts of Greek literature, or in most Graeco-Jewish biblical scrolls. Of the other eleven, including <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, he states that their scribes were:\n\n{{quote|..not trained in calligraphy and so not accustomed to writing books, though they were familiar with them; they employ what is basically a documentary hand but at the same time they are aware that it is a book and not a document on which they are engaged.  They are not personal or private hands; and in most a degree of regularity and of clarity is aimed at and achieved.  Such hands may be described as \"reformed documentary\".  (One advantage for the paleographer in such hands is that with their close links to the documents they are somewhat less difficult to date than purely calligraphic hands).<ref>Roberts, C. H. ''Manuscript, Society and Belief in Early Christian Egypt'', London: OUP for the British Academy, 1979 (based on the 1977 series of Schweich Lectures), pp. 12-14</ref>}}\n\nIt may be added that the codex of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, with its good quality papyrus, wide margins, large clear even upright letters, short lines in continuous script, decorative hooks and finials, and bilinear writing,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref> would have presented an overall appearance not far from that of professionally written Christian codices such as [[Papyrus 64|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>64</sup>]] or [[Papyrus 77|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>77</sup>]], even though its actual letter forms are not as fine, and are closer to documentary exemplars.\n\n== Date ==\nThe significance of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> rests both upon its proposed early dating and upon its geographic dispersal from the presumed site of authorship, traditionally thought to have been [[Ephesus]]. As the fragment is removed from the autograph by at least one step of transmission, the date of authorship for the Gospel of John must be at least a few years prior to the writing of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, whenever that may have been. The location of the fragment in Egypt extends that time even further, allowing for the dispersal of the documents from the point of authorship and transmission to the point of discovery. The Gospel of John is perhaps quoted by [[Justin Martyr]], and hence is highly likely to have been written before c. 160 CE;<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 25\">Roberts(1935), p. 25.</ref> but 20th century New Testament scholars, most influentially [[Kurt Aland]] and [[Bruce Metzger]], have argued from the proposed dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> prior to this, that the latest possible date for the composition of the Gospel should be pushed back into the early decades of the second century;<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 24\">Nongbri, p. 24.</ref> some scholars indeed arguing that the discovery of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> implies a date of composition for the Gospel no later than the traditionally accepted date of c. 90 CE, or even earlier.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 32\">Nongbri, p. 32.</ref>\n\nScepticism about the use of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to date the Gospel of John (not about the fragment's authenticity) is based on two issues. First, the papyrus has been dated based on the handwriting alone, without the support of dated textual references or associated archeology.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 25\">Nongbri, p. 25.</ref> Secondly, like all other surviving early Gospel manuscripts, this fragment is from a [[codex]], not a scroll. If it dates from the first half of the second century, this fragment would be amongst the earlier surviving examples of a literary codex.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref> (Around 90 CE, [[Martial]] circulated his poems in [[parchment]] codex form, presenting this as a novelty.) The year before Roberts published <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, the [[British Museum]] library had acquired papyrus fragments of the [[Egerton Gospel]] (P.Egerton 2) which are also from a codex, and these were published in 1935 by H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat.<ref>H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat. ''Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and Other Early Christian Papyri'', Oxford; OUP, 1935</ref> Since the text of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is that of a canonical gospel, the [[Gospel of John]], whereas that of the Egerton Gospel is not, there was considerable interest amongst biblical scholars as to whether <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> could be dated as the earlier of the two papyri.<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 34\">Roberts(1935), p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"Hurtado, p. 7\">Hurtado, p. 7.</ref>\n\n=== Colin Roberts ===\n\n<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is a literary text and, in common with almost all such papyri, has no explicit indicator of date. Proposing a date for it ultimately required comparison with dated texts, which tend to be in documentary hands (contracts, petitions, letters). Nevertheless, Roberts suggested two undated literary papyri as the closest comparators to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>: P. Berol. 6845<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 33\">Nongbri, p. 33.</ref> (a fragment of an [[Iliad]] scroll conserved in Berlin and dated paleographically to around the end of the first century) which he suggested (other than in the form of the letter alpha) is \"the closest parallel to our text that I have been able to find, a view that I was glad to find shared by so great an authority as Sir [[Frederic G. Kenyon|Frederic Kenyon]]\"; and P.Egerton 2 itself,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 34\">Nongbri, p. 34.</ref> which was then estimated to date around 150 CE. Roberts stated that in the Egerton Gospel, \"most of the characteristics of our hand are to be found, though in a less accentuated form\"; and he particularly noted similar forms of upsilon, mu and delta.<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 14\">Roberts(1935), p. 14.</ref>\n\nEstablishing the Berlin Iliad P. Berol 6845 as a comparator was key to Roberts proposing an early 2nd century date as plausible for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>; as the Berlin papyrus had been dated to the end of the first century by [[Wilhelm Schubart]], in a landmark papyrological study which demonstrated the close similarity of its hand to that of P. Fayum 110,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 35\">Nongbri, p. 35.</ref> a personal letter, but written by a professional scribe in a \"literary type\" hand<ref>Bernard P. Grenfell and Arthur S. Hunt, ''Fayum Towns and their Papyri'', London, Egypt Exploration Fund, 1900, p 263, \"written.. by a scribe in a well-formed uncial hand of a literary type, which being dated is important palaeographically\"</ref> and with an explicit date of 94 CE.<ref>Wilhelm Schubart ''Papyri Graecae Berolinenses XVII'', Bonn; Marcus and Weber, 1911</ref>  In proposing a date of around the middle of the second century for P. Egerton 2, Skeat and Bell had also relied on comparison with P.Fayum 110;<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 34\">Nongbri, p. 34.</ref> together with Abb 34 (now known as B.G.U. 1.22 and dated ca. 110-117 CE),<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 39\">Nongbri, p. 39.</ref> a letter in a documentary hand of the time of Trajan; and P.Lond. 1.130,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 48\">Nongbri, p. 48.</ref> a horoscope of late first or early second century date. The Berlin Iliad has since been re-edited in the light of more recent discoveries, but confirming Schubart's conclusions as to its dating around 100 CE, and its close relationship to the dated literary type hand of P.Fayum 110;<ref>William Lameere ''Apercus de palaeographie homerique a propos des papyrus de l'Illiade et de l'Odyssee des collections de Gand, de Bruxelles a de Louvain'', Paris; Editions Erasme, 1960, pp 81-83</ref> and it remains a primary exemplar of a particularly distinctive form of first/early second century CE calligraphic book hand.<ref>Guglielmo Cavallo ''Greek and Latin writing in the Papyi'' in \"The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology\" Roger S Bagnall ex., Oxford; OUP, 2009, p 114</ref>  Roberts in turn was also to advance P. Fayum 110 and Abb 34 (though not P.Lond. 1.130) as dated comparators to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, identifying P. Fayum 110 as the \"most important parallel\"  he could find among dated documents, and noting in particular that both of these showed the same two forms of alpha in simultaneous use.<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 15\">Roberts(1935), p. 15.</ref>  Nongbri  notes other instances where the letter forms in P. Fayum 110 are a closer match to those in <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> than are the counterpart forms in P. Berol 6845; specifically delta,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 36\">Nongbri, p. 36.</ref> pi, rho and epsilon. In his later career, Roberts reasserted the close resemblance of P. Fayum 110 to both <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and P. Egerton 2.<ref>Roberts C.H.''Greek Literary Hands 350BC - AD 400'', Oxford; Clarendon Press, 1955, p. 11</ref>\n\nRoberts also proposed two further dated papyri in documentary hands as comparators for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>:  P. London 2078, a private letter written in the reign of Domitian (81-96 CE),<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 37\">Nongbri, p. 37.</ref> and P. Oslo 22, a petition dated 127 CE;<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 38\">Nongbri, p. 38.</ref> noting that P. Oslo 22 was most similar in some of the more distinctive letter forms, e.g. eta, mu and iota. Roberts circulated his assessment to [[Frederic G. Kenyon]], [[Wilhelm Schubart]] and [[Idris Bell|H. I. Bell]]; all concurred with his dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> in the first half of the 2nd century.<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 15\">Roberts(1935), p. 15.</ref> Kenyon suggested another comparator in P. Flor 1. 1, a loan contract dated 153 CE;<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 40\">Nongbri, p. 40.</ref> but Roberts did not consider the similarity to be very close, other than for particular letters, as the overall style of that hand was [[cursive]].<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 16\">Roberts(1935), p. 16.</ref> In the same year 1935, Roberts's assessment of date was supported by the independent studies of [[Gustav Adolf Deissmann|A. Deissmann]], who, while producing no actual evidence, suggested a date in the reigns of Hadrian (117-138) or even Trajan (98-117).<ref name=\"Deissmann, Adolf 1935\">Deissmann, Adolf. \"Ein Evangelienblatt aus den Tagen Hadrians.\" ''[[Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]''; 564, 3 Dezemb. 1935 [English trans. in British Weekly December 12, 1935.]</ref> In 1936 the dating was supported by [[Ulrich Wilcken]] on the basis of a comparison between the hand of P52 and those of papyri in the extensive Apollonius archive which are dated 113-120.<ref>Wilcken Ulrich, ''Die Bremer Papyrus-Sammlung'', FF 12, 1936, p. 90</ref>\n\n=== Philip Comfort ===\n\nSubsequently, other comparator literary papyri have been suggested, notably P. Oxy. XXXI 2533,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 47\">Nongbri, p. 47.</ref> where a literary text of the second century in a hand proposed as very close to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is found written on the back of a re-used document in a late first century business hand;<ref>Philip W. Comfort and David P. Barrett, ''The Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts'', Wheaton Ill; Tyndale, 2001, p. 367</ref> and also three biblical papyrus codices; P. Oxy. LX 4009 (an apocryphal gospel fragment, dated paleographically to the early/mid second century);  and P. Oxy. L 3523 ([[Papyrus 90|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>90</sup>]]) and P. Oxy. LXIV 4404 ([[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]]) both dated paleographically to the later second century.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall, ''Early Christian Books in Egypt'', Princeton; Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 15-16</ref> In addition, the discovery of other papyrus codices with second century hands, such as the Yale Genesis Fragment (P. Yale 1),<ref>T. C. Skeat, \"Early Christian Book Production, Papyri and Mancuscripts\" in G. W. Lampe ed. ''The Cambridge History of the Bible'', Cambridge; CUP, 1969, pp71-75</ref> suggested that this form of book was more common for literary texts at this date than had previously been assumed. Consequently, until the 1990s, the tendency amongst New Testament commentators, supported by several paleographers such as Philip W. Comfort, had been to suggest a date for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> towards the earlier half of the range suggested by Roberts and his correspondents.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref> However, a cautionary note was raised by the discovery that a papyrus fragment in Cologne constitutes part of the Egerton Gospel.<ref>M. Gronewald et al, ''Kolner Papyri VI'', Opladen; Westdeutscher Verlag, 1987, p. 136-145</ref> In this fragment the letters gamma and kappa are separated by an hooked apostrophe, a feature infrequent in dated second century papyri; which accordingly has been taken as implying a date for the Egerton Gospel closer to 200 CE - and indicating the perils of ascribing a date for a papyrus text of which only a small part of two pages survives.\n\n=== Brent Nongbri ===\n\nThe early date for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> favoured by many [[New Testament]] scholars has been challenged by Andreas Schmidt, who favours a date around 170 CE, plus or minus twenty-five years; on the basis of a comparison with [[Chester Beatty Papyri|Chester Beatty Papyri X and III]], and with the redated Egerton Gospel.<ref>A. Schmidt, \"Zwei Anmerkungen zu P. Ryl. III 457,\" ''Archiv f\u00fcr Papyrusforschung'' '''35''' (1989:11\u201312).</ref>  Brent Nongbri<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 46\"/> has criticized both Comfort's early dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and Schmidt's late dating, dismissing as unsound all attempts to establish a date for such undated papyri within narrow ranges on purely paleographic grounds, along with any inference from the paleographic dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to a precise ''terminus ad quem'' for the composition of the Fourth Gospel. In particular Nongbri noted that both Comfort and Schmidt propose their respective revisions of Roberts's dating solely on the basis of paleographic comparisons with papyri that had themselves been paleographically dated. As a corrective to both tendencies, Nongbri collected and published images of all explicitly dated comparator manuscripts to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>; demonstrating that, although Roberts's assessment of similarities with a succession of dated late first to mid second century papyri could be confirmed,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 40\">Nongbri, p. 40.</ref> two later dated papyri, both petitions,  also showed strong similarities (P. Mich. inv. 5336,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 41\">Nongbri, p. 41.</ref> dated around 152 CE; and P.Amh. 2.78,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 42\">Nongbri, p. 42.</ref> an example first suggested by [[Eric Gardner Turner|Eric Turner]],<ref name=\"Eric Turner 1977, p. 100\">Eric Turner, ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania Press, 1977, p. 100</ref> that dates to 184 CE). Nongbri states \"The affinities in letter forms between (P. Mich. inv. 5336) and <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> are as close as any of Roberts's documentary parallels\",<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 41\">Nongbri, p. 41.</ref> and that P.Amh. 2.78 \"is as good a parallel to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> as any of these adduced by Roberts\".<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref>  Nongbri also produces dated documents of the later second and early third centuries,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 43-45\">Nongbri, p. 43-45.</ref> each of which display similarities to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> in some of their letter forms. Nongbri suggests that this implied that older styles of handwriting might persist much longer than some scholars had assumed,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 32\">Nongbri, p. 32.</ref> and that a prudent margin of error must allow a still wider range of possible dates for the papyrus:\n\n{{quote|What emerges from this survey is nothing surprising to papyrologists: paleography is not the most effective method for dating texts, particularly those written in a literary hand. Roberts himself noted this point in his edition of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>. The real problem is the way scholars of the New Testament have used and abused papyrological evidence.  I have not radically revised Roberts's work. I have not provided any third-century documentary papyri that are absolute \"dead ringers\" for the handwriting of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, and even had I done so, that would not force us to date P52 at some exact point in the third century. Paleographic evidence does not work that way. What I have done is to show that any serious consideration of the window of possible dates for P52 must include dates in the later second and early third centuries. Thus, P52 cannot be used as evidence to silence other debates about the existence (or non-existence) of the Gospel of John in the first half of the second century. Only a papyrus containing an explicit date or one found in a clear archaeological stratigraphic context could do the work scholars want P52 to do. As it stands now, the papyrological evidence should take a second place to other forms of evidence in addressing debates about the dating of the Fourth Gospel.}}\n\nNongbri resists offering his own opinion on the date of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, but apparently approves the relatively cautious terminology both of Roberts's dating, \"On the whole, we may accept with some confidence the first half of the second century as the period in which (<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>) was most probably written\";<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 16\">Roberts(1935), p. 16.</ref><ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 30\">Nongbri, p. 30.</ref> and also of Roberts's speculations on possible implications for the date of John's gospel, \"But all we can safely say is that this fragment tends to support those critics who favour an early date (late first to early second century) for the composition of the Gospel rather than those who would still regard it as a work of the middle decades of the second century\".<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 30\">Nongbri, p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 26\">Roberts(1935), p. 26.</ref> Nevertheless, and notwithstanding Nongbri's statement to the contrary, some commentators have interpreted his accumulation of later dated comparators as undermining Roberts's proposed dating;<ref>Roger S. Bagnall, ''Early Christian Books in Egypt'', Princeton; Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 12, \".. undermine confidence in an early date, even if they do not fully establish one in the late second or early third century\"</ref>  but such interpretations fail to take into account the essential similarity of Roberts's and Nongbri's main findings.  Roberts identified the closest parallels to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> as being P. Berol 6845 and P. Egerton 2,<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 14\">Roberts(1935), p. 14.</ref> then dated paleographically to 100 CE and 150 CE respectively; and proposed that the most probable date for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> would lie in between these two.  Nongbri rejects paleographically dated comparators on principle, and consequently proposes the closest dated parallels to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> as being P. Fayum 110 of 94 CE, P.Mich. inv. 5336 of ca. 152 CE and P.Amh. 2.78 of 184 CE; each, he suggests, as close to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> as the others,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 36\">Nongbri, p. 36.</ref><ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 41\">Nongbri, p. 41.</ref> and all three closer than any other dated comparator. The consequence is to extend the range of dated primary reference comparators both earlier and later than in Roberts work; and Nongbri stresses that, simply from paleographic evidence, the actual date of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> could conceivably be later (or earlier) still.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 46\">Nongbri, p. 46.</ref> Although Nongbri is concerned to demonstrate that the possibility of a late second (or early third) century date for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> cannot be discounted, his chief criticism is directed at those subsequent commentators and scholars who have tended to take the midpoint of Roberts's proposed range of dates, treat it as the latest limit for a possible date for this papyrus, and then infer from this that the Gospel of John cannot have been written later than around 100 CE.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref>\n.\n\n=== Stanley Porter ===\n\nThe relationship of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to P.Egerton 2 has been further re-examined in detail by Stanley E. Porter. Porter offers two further comparator early biblical papyri for both texts, P. Oxy IV 656 (a fragment of Genesis) and P.Vindob. G. 2325 (another apocryphal gospel, the [[Fayum Fragment]]); and provides a wide-ranging survey of the history and range of opinion amongst papyrologists for the dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and P.Egerton 2, presenting arguments to support Robert's judgement that the two are close parallels, that they are unlikely to be of widely separate dates, and that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is more likely the earlier. Specifically he notes that P.Egerton 2 is in \"a less heavy hand with more formal rounded characteristics, but with what the original editors called \"cursive affinities\".\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 82\">Porter, p. 82.</ref>  Porter adds that \"Both manuscripts were apparently written before the development of a more formal Biblical majuscule style, which began to develop in the late second and early third centuries.\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 83\">Porter, p. 83.</ref>  In this respect, Porter also notes that although the hooked apostrophe form found in the Cologne fragment of P.Egerton 2 is unusual in the second century, there is at least one known dated example in a papyrus of 101 CE and three others of mid or late second century date. \"The result is to bring the two manuscripts together, somewhere in the middle of the second century, perhaps tending towards the early part of it.\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 84\">Porter, p. 84.</ref>\n\nStanley Porter has also questioned Nongbri's assertion that valid comparisons can be made between <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and documentary papyri of the later second and early third centuries; noting the warning from Eric Turner that, \u201cComparison of book hands with dated documentary hands will be less reliable, the intention of the scribe is different in the two cases.\u201d<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"Porter, p. 79\">Porter, p. 79.</ref> and in respect of this Porter cautions against what he terms Nongbri's 'overly skeptical'<ref name=\"Porter, p. 78\">Porter, p. 78.</ref> insistence on disregarding comparators without an explicit date, forcing comparators for literary texts inappropriately to be confined to purely documentary hands.<ref name=\"Porter, p. 81\">Porter, p. 81.</ref> Porter suggests that Nongbri's proposed late second and third century comparators are in several cases quite different from <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> so that they force comparison to focus on detailed letter forms without consideration of the overall formation, trajectory and style of the script. If, rather than undertaking comparisons document by document, typological letter comparisons are instead applied using published series of dated representative script alphabets,<ref>Edward Maude Thompson, ''An Introduction to Greek and Latin Paleaography'', Oxford; Clarendon Press, 1912, pp. 144-147</ref><ref>Eric G. Turner, ''Greek Manuscripts of Antiquity'', Oxford, OUP, 1971, p. 2</ref> then, Porter asserts, both <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and P.Egerton 2 \"fit comfortably within the second century. There are of course some letters that are similar to those in the third century (as there are some in the first century) but the letters that tend to be given the most individualization, such as alpha, mu and even sigma, appear to be second century.\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 82\">Porter, p. 82.</ref> Both Porter and Nongbri note that Eric Turner, notwithstanding his proposal of P.Amh. 2.78 as a parallel for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, nevertheless continued to maintain that \"The Rylands papyrus may therefore be accepted as of the first half of the second century\".<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"Eric Turner 1977, p. 100\"/><ref name=\"Porter, p. 77\">Porter, p. 77.</ref>\n\n=== Don Barker ===\n\nAn altogether different approach to dating New Testament papyri has been proposed by a number of paleographers in recent years, drawing on the notion of \"graphic stream\" developed by [[Guglielmo Cavallo]]. Rather than comparing letter forms of undated papyri directly with dated comparators, it is proposed that the hand in question should first be identified to a graphic stream representing the overall development of a particular handwriting style. \"The way that individual letters are formed within these graphic streams is secondary to the overall style of the script\".<ref name=\"Barker, p. 572\">Barker, p. 572</ref>  Don Barker, reviewing the proposed comparators and range of datings that have been advanced over the years for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, maintains that this papyrus can be placed in a \"round block script\" graphic stream that is attested from the first century onwards; and notes eleven dated examples ranging from P.Oxy. 3466 (81-96 CE) to P.Oxy.3183 (292 CE) and including all the later parallels proposed by Nongbri and Turner as well as P.Fayum 110 (94 CE) from Roberts's original study. Otherwise, however, Barker rejects from this graphic stream all the other comparators proposed by Roberts and his correspondents, including P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE).  Barker maintains that the letter formation within this the graphic stream \"appears to have great holding power\", and proposes that it is consequently difficult to place <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> into a narrower time frame within it. \" When the general style and individual letter features are kept in close connection and keeping in mind how a scribe writing a documentary text may write a literary text differently, it would seem from the above dated manuscripts, that a date of the second or third century could be assigned to P.Ryl. 457\".\"<ref name=\"Barker, p. 575\">Barker, p. 575</ref>\n\n=== Pasquale Orsini and Willy Clarysse ===\n\n[[Pasquale Orsini]] and Willy Clarysse also adopt the \"graphic stream\" approach; and have applied it to reviewing the dating for all New Testament manuscripts proposed as having been written before the mid-fourth century, including <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>. Since none of these papyri and parchments carry explicit dates, all must be dated paleographically; so Orsini and Clarysse propose that manuscript comparisons for such paleographic dating should be made only between hands that are similar to one another.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 448\">Orsini, p. 448.</ref> However, and in contrast to Don Barker, their classification of hands conforms rigorously to the typology of Hellenistic Greek handwriting styles developed by [[Guglielmo Cavallo]];<ref>Guglielmo Cavallo, ''Il calamo e il papiro.  La scittura greca dall'eta ellenistica ai primi secoli di Bisanzio'', Florence; Papyrologica Florentina 36, 2005, p. 75</ref> applying his categorisation of hands into 'styles', 'stylistic classes' or 'graphic types' as appropriate.  Orsini and Clarysse propose dates for New Testament papyri that are often rather later than the consensus dates in the Nestle-Aland lists,<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 466\">Orsini, p. 466.</ref> and considerably later than the counterpart dates proposed by Comfort and Barrett.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 445\">Orsini, p. 445.</ref> They criticise Don Barker for assigning dates they regard as extending too early;<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 460\">Orsini, p. 460.</ref> the dating ranges they themselves propose for New Testament papyri are never wider than 100 years, more frequently 50 years, and for several early papyri ([[Papyrus 46|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>46</sup>]], [[Papyrus 95|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>95</sup>]], [[Papyrus 64|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>64+67</sup>]]) they propose purely paleographic dates within a 25-year range.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 470\">Orsini, p. 470.</ref> In their paper Orsini and Clarysse state that the early parallels proposed for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> by Comfort and Barrett are \"inappropriate\";<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 462\">Orsini, p. 462.</ref> and, although they cite with approval Nongbri's assessment of the respective papyrological dating approaches adopted by Grenfell, Hunt and Roberts, they do not cite his specific study of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, and none of his proposed later parallels feature in their list of stylistically similar comparators; nor do any of other papyri advanced by Barker as representatives of his proposed graphic stream.  Of the papyri discussed by Roberts and his correspondents, and in contradiction to Barker, Orsini and Clarysse maintain Kenyon's proposed dated parallel, P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE) as corresponding to the same \"Round Chancery Script\" graphic type as <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 458\">Orsini, p. 458.</ref> Two further comparators they propose are PSI V 446, the official proclamation of an edict of the prefect Petronius dated 132-137 CE; and P. Fayum 87, a municipal receipt dated 156 CE;<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 462\">Orsini, p. 462.</ref> while they also note, as other commentators have done, the close similarity of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] for which they propose a date of 100-200 CE.  Consequently, Orsini and Clarysse propose 125 to 175 CE as the range of dates for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>;<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 470\">Orsini, p. 470.</ref> which corresponds with the \"mid second century\" date proposed Stanley Porter, is much narrower than the ranges envisaged by Barker or Nongbri, and implies within their dating schema that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] stand as the earliest New Testament papyri so far identified (although, strangely, at the conclusion of their article, Orsini and Clarysse state that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, [[Papyrus 90|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>90</sup>]], and [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] \"probably all [date to] the second half of the second century).\"<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 466\">Orsini, p. 466.</ref>\n\n=== John Rylands Library ===\n\nThe John Rylands Library states \"The first editor dated the Fragment to the first half of the second century (between 100-150 AD). The date was estimated palaeographically, by comparing the handwriting with other manuscripts. However, palaeography is not an exact science - none of the comparable Biblical manuscripts are dated and most papyri bearing a secure date are administrative documents. Recent research points to a date nearer to 200 AD, but there is as yet no convincing evidence that any earlier fragments from the New Testament survive.\"<ref>http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/guide-to-special-collections/st-john-fragment/</ref>\n\n== Text-critical and historical significance ==\n\nFinds of early Christian papyri from Egypt represent the earliest surviving indisputable physical evidence for Christianity and the Christian Gospel.<ref>Larry W. Hurtado, ''The Earliest Christian Artefacts: Manuscripts and Christian Origins'', Grand Rapids; Eerdemans, 2006,</ref> There is a considerable degree of overlap in the proposed ranges of dates for these papyri and consequently it cannot be stated categorically that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is earlier than other New Testament fragments of apparent 2nd century date; [[Papyrus 90|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>90</sup>]], [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] or perhaps [[Papyrus 64|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>64+67</sup>]]; nor that it is earlier than some early apocryphal texts; [[Egerton Gospel|P. Egerton. 2]], P.Oxy. LX 4009. There are in addition a number of papyrus fragments of Old Testament books in Greek (chiefly Psalms) which have also been dated to the 2nd century, and whose characteristics have been advanced as indicating a Christian, rather than Jewish or pagan, origin.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall, ''Early Christian Books in Egypt'', Princeton; Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 11-12</ref> Nevertheless; since all of these papyri have been dated paleographically, and mostly with reference to the same dated documentary comparators, they may be considered as a manuscript cluster whose estimated dates will vary as a group; amongst which <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is commonly recognised as having earlier features.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall, ''Early Christian Books in Egypt'', Princeton; Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 12-15</ref> Moreover, and small though it is, the text that survives in <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is sufficient to provide early witness to a number of key historical claims about the [[Historical Jesus]], albeit that it does not include his actual name.  But in these verses we find a man tried before the Roman authorities at a specific date (the governorship of Pontius Pilate), at a specific place (the Praetorium in Jerusalem), sentenced to a specific death (crucifixion), and all at the instigation of the Jewish Temple authorities.\n\nIf the early 2nd century dating of the <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is in fact correct, then the fact that the fragment is from a [[codex]] rather than a [[scroll]] would testify to the very early adoption of this mode of writing amongst Christians, in stark contrast to the apparent practice of contemporary [[Judaism]]. Furthermore, an assessment of the length of 'missing' text between the recto and verso readings corresponds with that in the counterpart canonical Gospel of John; and hence confirms that there are unlikely to have been substantial additions or deletions in this whole portion. Other than two [[iotacism]]s (\u0397\u039c'''''\u0395'''''\u0399\u039d, '''''\u0399'''''\u03a3\u0397\u039b\u0398\u0395\u039d), and in the probable omission of the second \u0395\u0399\u03a3 \u03a4\u039f\u03a5\u03a4\u039f from line 2 of the verso, <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> agrees with the Alexandrian text base. In lines 4 and 5 of the recto the reconstructed text reads \u03a0\u0391\u039b\u0399\u039d \u0395\u0399\u03a3 \u03a4\u039f \u03a0\u03a1\u0391\u0399\u03a4\u03a9\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u039d \u039f \u03a0\u0399\u039b\u0391\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 in agreement with [[Papyrus 66|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup>]] and with the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] whereas the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus]] and the [[Majority Text]] all have the alternative word order; \u0395\u0399\u03a3 \u03a4\u039f \u03a0\u03a1\u0391\u0399\u03a4\u03a9\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u039d \u03a0\u0391\u039b\u0399\u039d \u039f \u03a0\u0399\u039b\u0391\u03a4\u039f\u03a3,<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 29\">Roberts(1935), p. 29.</ref> but this is hardly a significant variant. Since this fragment is small &ndash; about nine by six centimetres &ndash; it cannot be proven that it comes from a full copy of the ''John'' that we know; but it may be presumed that the original text was at least of near full gospel length to be worth the extra care and time required in writing in codex form.  On the other hand, the generous scale and format of the codex pages of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> are such that it is highly unlikely that it could originally have comprised the four canonical gospels; Roberts calculated that such a codex might have required 576 pages.<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 20\">Roberts(1935), p. 20.</ref>\n\n<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is small, and although a plausible reconstruction can be attempted for most of the fourteen lines represented, the proportion of the text of the Gospel of John for which it provides a direct witness is necessarily limited, so it is rarely cited in textual debate.<ref>Tuckett 2001:544</ref><ref>[http://www.skypoint.com/~waltzmn/ManuscriptsPapyri.html#P52 New Testament Manuscripts: Papyri]</ref><ref>[http://www.historian.net/P52.html \"The oldest New Testament: P52\"] Historian.net.</ref> There has, however, been some contention as to whether the name ''\u0399\u0397\u03a3\u039f\u03a5'' (Jesus) in the 'missing' portions of recto lines 2 and 5 was originally written as ''[[nomina sacra|nomen sacrum]]''; in other words, was it contracted to ''\u0399\u03a3'' or ''\u0399\u0397\u03a3'' in accordance with otherwise universal Christian practice in surviving early Gospel manuscripts.

Also present in two forms is the letter upsilon '''\u03a5'''; the more common form is constructed from two strokes, each stroke terminating in a decorative hook or finial (see the second line of the recto); but on the fourth line of the verso is an upsilon formed from a single looped stroke with no decoration.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref> These observations support Roberts's supposition that the scribe was an educated person writing carefully in imitation of a calligraphic hand, rather than a professional scribe writing to order; such that, on occasion, the writer inadvertently reverted to the undecorated (and often smaller) letter forms of his everyday hand.\n\nRoberts noted that in addition to alpha and upsilon, other letters also tend to be given decorative hooks, especially iota '''\u0399''' and omega '''\u03a9''' (both seen in the seventh line of the recto).<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 13\">Roberts(1935), p. 13.</ref>  He also drew attention to the forms of epsilon '''\u0395''' (with an extended cross-stroke a little above the centre-line, as in the fourth line of the verso), delta '''\u0394''' (with a decorative arch, as in the first and second lines of the recto) and mu '''\u039c''' (with a central stroke dipping down to the baseline, as in the third line of the recto).<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 13\">Roberts(1935), p. 13.</ref>  Nongbri confirms Roberts observations, and also notes distinctive forms of rho '''\u03a1''' (with a small head and an undecorated downstroke extending well below the lower line, as in the second line of the verso),<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref> pi '''\u03a0''' (with an extended horizontal stroke, as in the third line of the recto)<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 33\">Nongbri, p. 33.</ref> and kappa '''\u039a''' (formed like the looped upsilon with an additional downwards stroke, as in the fourth line of the recto).<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref>  Aside from their sometimes clumsy construction, the sigma and eta are also distinctive in form; the sigma facing fully to the right, and the eta having a distinctive high cross stroke.\n\nIn 1977, Roberts surveyed fourteen papyri believed to be of Christian origin, twelve codices and two scrolls; comprising all the Christian manuscripts then commonly assessed as likely having a second century date including <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>. He considered that only three of these texts had a calligraphic bookhand, such as was then standard in formal manuscripts of Greek literature, or in most Graeco-Jewish biblical scrolls. Of the other eleven, including <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, he states that their scribes were:\n\n{{quote|..not trained in calligraphy and so not accustomed to writing books, though they were familiar with them; they employ what is basically a documentary hand but at the same time they are aware that it is a book and not a document on which they are engaged.  They are not personal or private hands; and in most a degree of regularity and of clarity is aimed at and achieved.  Such hands may be described as \"reformed documentary\".  (One advantage for the paleographer in such hands is that with their close links to the documents they are somewhat less difficult to date than purely calligraphic hands).<ref>Roberts, C. H. ''Manuscript, Society and Belief in Early Christian Egypt'', London: OUP for the British Academy, 1979 (based on the 1977 series of Schweich Lectures), pp. 12-14</ref>}}\n\nIt may be added that the codex of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, with its good quality papyrus, wide margins, large clear even upright letters, short lines in continuous script, decorative hooks and finials, and bilinear writing,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 28\">Nongbri, p. 28.</ref> would have presented an overall appearance not far from that of professionally written Christian codices such as [[Papyrus 64|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>64</sup>]] or [[Papyrus 77|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>77</sup>]], even though its actual letter forms are not as fine, and are closer to documentary exemplars.\n\n== Date ==\nThe significance of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> rests both upon its proposed early dating and upon its geographic dispersal from the presumed site of authorship, traditionally thought to have been [[Ephesus]]. As the fragment is removed from the autograph by at least one step of transmission, the date of authorship for the Gospel of John must be at least a few years prior to the writing of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, whenever that may have been. The location of the fragment in Egypt extends that time even further, allowing for the dispersal of the documents from the point of authorship and transmission to the point of discovery. The Gospel of John is perhaps quoted by [[Justin Martyr]], and hence is highly likely to have been written before c. 160 CE;<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 25\">Roberts(1935), p. 25.</ref> but 20th century New Testament scholars, most influentially [[Kurt Aland]] and [[Bruce Metzger]], have argued from the proposed dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> prior to this, that the latest possible date for the composition of the Gospel should be pushed back into the early decades of the second century;<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 24\">Nongbri, p. 24.</ref> some scholars indeed arguing that the discovery of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> implies a date of composition for the Gospel no later than the traditionally accepted date of c. 90 CE, or even earlier.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 32\">Nongbri, p. 32.</ref>\n\nScepticism about the use of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to date the Gospel of John (not about the fragment's authenticity) is based on two issues. First, the papyrus has been dated based on the handwriting alone, without the support of dated textual references or associated archeology.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 25\">Nongbri, p. 25.</ref> Secondly, like all other surviving early Gospel manuscripts, this fragment is from a [[codex]], not a scroll. If it dates from the first half of the second century, this fragment would be amongst the earlier surviving examples of a literary codex.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref> (Around 90 CE, [[Martial]] circulated his poems in [[parchment]] codex form, presenting this as a novelty.) The year before Roberts published <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, the [[British Museum]] library had acquired papyrus fragments of the [[Egerton Gospel]] (P.Egerton 2) which are also from a codex, and these were published in 1935 by H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat.<ref>H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat. ''Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and Other Early Christian Papyri'', Oxford; OUP, 1935</ref> Since the text of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is that of a canonical gospel, the [[Gospel of John]], whereas that of the Egerton Gospel is not, there was considerable interest amongst biblical scholars as to whether <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> could be dated as the earlier of the two papyri.<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 34\">Roberts(1935), p. 34.</ref><ref name=\"Hurtado, p. 7\">Hurtado, p. 7.</ref>\n\n=== Colin Roberts ===\n\n<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is a literary text and, in common with almost all such papyri, has no explicit indicator of date. Proposing a date for it ultimately required comparison with dated texts, which tend to be in documentary hands (contracts, petitions, letters).

Berol. 6845<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 33\">Nongbri, p. 33.</ref> (a fragment of an [[Iliad]] scroll conserved in Berlin and dated paleographically to around the end of the first century) which he suggested (other than in the form of the letter alpha) is \"the closest parallel to our text that I have been able to find, a view that I was glad to find shared by so great an authority as Sir [[Frederic G. Kenyon|Frederic Kenyon]]\"; and P.Egerton 2 itself,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 34\">Nongbri, p. 34.</ref> which was then estimated to date around 150 CE.

''The Cambridge History of the Bible'', Cambridge; CUP, 1969, pp71-75</ref> suggested that this form of book was more common for literary texts at this date than had previously been assumed. Consequently, until the 1990s, the tendency amongst New Testament commentators, supported by several paleographers such as Philip W.

Schmidt, \"Zwei Anmerkungen zu P. Ryl. III 457,\" ''Archiv f\u00fcr Papyrusforschung'' '''35''' (1989:11\u201312).</ref>  Brent Nongbri<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 46\"/> has criticized both Comfort's early dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and Schmidt's late dating, dismissing as unsound all attempts to establish a date for such undated papyri within narrow ranges on purely paleographic grounds, along with any inference from the paleographic dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to a precise ''terminus ad quem'' for the composition of the Fourth Gospel. In particular Nongbri noted that both Comfort and Schmidt propose their respective revisions of Roberts's dating solely on the basis of paleographic comparisons with papyri that had themselves been paleographically dated. As a corrective to both tendencies, Nongbri collected and published images of all explicitly dated comparator manuscripts to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>; demonstrating that, although Roberts's assessment of similarities with a succession of dated late first to mid second century papyri could be confirmed,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 40\">Nongbri, p. 40.</ref> two later dated papyri, both petitions,  also showed strong similarities (P. Mich. inv. 5336,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 41\">Nongbri, p. 41.</ref> dated around 152 CE; and P.Amh. 2.78,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 42\">Nongbri, p. 42.</ref> an example first suggested by [[Eric Gardner Turner|Eric Turner]],<ref name=\"Eric Turner 1977, p. 100\">Eric Turner, ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania Press, 1977, p. 100</ref> that dates to 184 CE). Nongbri states \"The affinities in letter forms between (P.

Nongbri suggests that this implied that older styles of handwriting might persist much longer than some scholars had assumed,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 32\">Nongbri, p. 32.</ref> and that a prudent margin of error must allow a still wider range of possible dates for the papyrus:\n\n{{quote|What emerges from this survey is nothing surprising to papyrologists: paleography is not the most effective method for dating texts, particularly those written in a literary hand. Roberts himself noted this point in his edition of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>. The real problem is the way scholars of the New Testament have used and abused papyrological evidence.  I have not radically revised Roberts's work. I have not provided any third-century documentary papyri that are absolute \"dead ringers\" for the handwriting of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, and even had I done so, that would not force us to date P52 at some exact point in the third century. Paleographic evidence does not work that way. What I have done is to show that any serious consideration of the window of possible dates for P52 must include dates in the later second and early third centuries. Thus, P52 cannot be used as evidence to silence other debates about the existence (or non-existence) of the Gospel of John in the first half of the second century. Only a papyrus containing an explicit date or one found in a clear archaeological stratigraphic context could do the work scholars want P52 to do. As it stands now, the papyrological evidence should take a second place to other forms of evidence in addressing debates about the dating of the Fourth Gospel.}}\n\nNongbri resists offering his own opinion on the date of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, but apparently approves the relatively cautious terminology both of Roberts's dating, \"On the whole, we may accept with some confidence the first half of the second century as the period in which (<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>) was most probably written\";<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 16\">Roberts(1935), p. 16.</ref><ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 30\">Nongbri, p. 30.</ref> and also of Roberts's speculations on possible implications for the date of John's gospel, \"But all we can safely say is that this fragment tends to support those critics who favour an early date (late first to early second century) for the composition of the Gospel rather than those who would still regard it as a work of the middle decades of the second century\".<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 30\">Nongbri, p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 26\">Roberts(1935), p. 26.</ref> Nevertheless, and notwithstanding Nongbri's statement to the contrary, some commentators have interpreted his accumulation of later dated comparators as undermining Roberts's proposed dating;<ref>Roger S. Bagnall, ''Early Christian Books in Egypt'', Princeton; Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 12, \".. undermine confidence in an early date, even if they do not fully establish one in the late second or early third century\"</ref>  but such interpretations fail to take into account the essential similarity of Roberts's and Nongbri's main findings.  Roberts identified the closest parallels to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> as being P. Berol 6845 and P. Egerton 2,<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 14\">Roberts(1935), p. 14.</ref> then dated paleographically to 100 CE and 150 CE respectively; and proposed that the most probable date for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> would lie in between these two.  Nongbri rejects paleographically dated comparators on principle, and consequently proposes the closest dated parallels to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> as being P. Fayum 110 of 94 CE, P.Mich. inv. 5336 of ca. 152 CE and P.Amh. 2.78 of 184 CE; each, he suggests, as close to <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> as the others,<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 36\">Nongbri, p. 36.</ref><ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 41\">Nongbri, p. 41.</ref> and all three closer than any other dated comparator. The consequence is to extend the range of dated primary reference comparators both earlier and later than in Roberts work; and Nongbri stresses that, simply from paleographic evidence, the actual date of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> could conceivably be later (or earlier) still.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 46\">Nongbri, p. 46.</ref> Although Nongbri is concerned to demonstrate that the possibility of a late second (or early third) century date for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> cannot be discounted, his chief criticism is directed at those subsequent commentators and scholars who have tended to take the midpoint of Roberts's proposed range of dates, treat it as the latest limit for a possible date for this papyrus, and then infer from this that the Gospel of John cannot have been written later than around 100 CE.<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref>\n.\n\n=== Stanley Porter ===\n\nThe relationship of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to P.Egerton 2 has been further re-examined in detail by Stanley E. Porter. Porter offers two further comparator early biblical papyri for both texts, P. Oxy IV 656 (a fragment of Genesis) and P.Vindob. G. 2325 (another apocryphal gospel, the [[Fayum Fragment]]); and provides a wide-ranging survey of the history and range of opinion amongst papyrologists for the dating of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and P.Egerton 2, presenting arguments to support Robert's judgement that the two are close parallels, that they are unlikely to be of widely separate dates, and that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is more likely the earlier. Specifically he notes that P.Egerton 2 is in \"a less heavy hand with more formal rounded characteristics, but with what the original editors called \"cursive affinities\".\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 82\">Porter, p. 82.</ref>  Porter adds that \"Both manuscripts were apparently written before the development of a more formal Biblical majuscule style, which began to develop in the late second and early third centuries.\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 83\">Porter, p. 83.</ref>  In this respect, Porter also notes that although the hooked apostrophe form found in the Cologne fragment of P.Egerton 2 is unusual in the second century, there is at least one known dated example in a papyrus of 101 CE and three others of mid or late second century date. \"The result is to bring the two manuscripts together, somewhere in the middle of the second century, perhaps tending towards the early part of it.\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 84\">Porter, p. 84.</ref>\n\nStanley Porter has also questioned Nongbri's assertion that valid comparisons can be made between <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and documentary papyri of the later second and early third centuries; noting the warning from Eric Turner that, \u201cComparison of book hands with dated documentary hands will be less reliable, the intention of the scribe is different in the two cases.\u201d<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"Porter, p. 79\">Porter, p. 79.</ref> and in respect of this Porter cautions against what he terms Nongbri's 'overly skeptical'<ref name=\"Porter, p. 78\">Porter, p. 78.</ref> insistence on disregarding comparators without an explicit date, forcing comparators for literary texts inappropriately to be confined to purely documentary hands.<ref name=\"Porter, p. 81\">Porter, p. 81.</ref> Porter suggests that Nongbri's proposed late second and third century comparators are in several cases quite different from <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> so that they force comparison to focus on detailed letter forms without consideration of the overall formation, trajectory and style of the script. If, rather than undertaking comparisons document by document, typological letter comparisons are instead applied using published series of dated representative script alphabets,<ref>Edward Maude Thompson, ''An Introduction to Greek and Latin Paleaography'', Oxford; Clarendon Press, 1912, pp. 144-147</ref><ref>Eric G. Turner, ''Greek Manuscripts of Antiquity'', Oxford, OUP, 1971, p. 2</ref> then, Porter asserts, both <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and P.Egerton 2 \"fit comfortably within the second century. There are of course some letters that are similar to those in the third century (as there are some in the first century) but the letters that tend to be given the most individualization, such as alpha, mu and even sigma, appear to be second century.\"<ref name=\"Porter, p. 82\">Porter, p. 82.</ref> Both Porter and Nongbri note that Eric Turner, notwithstanding his proposal of P.Amh. 2.78 as a parallel for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, nevertheless continued to maintain that \"The Rylands papyrus may therefore be accepted as of the first half of the second century\".<ref name=\"Nongbri, p. 31\">Nongbri, p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"Eric Turner 1977, p. 100\"/><ref name=\"Porter, p. 77\">Porter, p. 77.</ref>\n\n=== Don Barker ===\n\nAn altogether different approach to dating New Testament papyri has been proposed by a number of paleographers in recent years, drawing on the notion of \"graphic stream\" developed by [[Guglielmo Cavallo]]. Rather than comparing letter forms of undated papyri directly with dated comparators, it is proposed that the hand in question should first be identified to a graphic stream representing the overall development of a particular handwriting style. \"The way that individual letters are formed within these graphic streams is secondary to the overall style of the script\".<ref name=\"Barker, p. 572\">Barker, p. 572</ref>  Don Barker, reviewing the proposed comparators and range of datings that have been advanced over the years for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, maintains that this papyrus can be placed in a \"round block script\" graphic stream that is attested from the first century onwards; and notes eleven dated examples ranging from P.Oxy. 3466 (81-96 CE) to P.Oxy.3183 (292 CE) and including all the later parallels proposed by Nongbri and Turner as well as P.Fayum 110 (94 CE) from Roberts's original study. Otherwise, however, Barker rejects from this graphic stream all the other comparators proposed by Roberts and his correspondents, including P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE).  Barker maintains that the letter formation within this the graphic stream \"appears to have great holding power\", and proposes that it is consequently difficult to place <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> into a narrower time frame within it. \" When the general style and individual letter features are kept in close connection and keeping in mind how a scribe writing a documentary text may write a literary text differently, it would seem from the above dated manuscripts, that a date of the second or third century could be assigned to P.Ryl. 457\".\"<ref name=\"Barker, p. 575\">Barker, p. 575</ref>\n\n=== Pasquale Orsini and Willy Clarysse ===\n\n[[Pasquale Orsini]] and Willy Clarysse also adopt the \"graphic stream\" approach; and have applied it to reviewing the dating for all New Testament manuscripts proposed as having been written before the mid-fourth century, including <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>. Since none of these papyri and parchments carry explicit dates, all must be dated paleographically; so Orsini and Clarysse propose that manuscript comparisons for such paleographic dating should be made only between hands that are similar to one another.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 448\">Orsini, p. 448.</ref> However, and in contrast to Don Barker, their classification of hands conforms rigorously to the typology of Hellenistic Greek handwriting styles developed by [[Guglielmo Cavallo]];<ref>Guglielmo Cavallo, ''Il calamo e il papiro.  La scittura greca dall'eta ellenistica ai primi secoli di Bisanzio'', Florence; Papyrologica Florentina 36, 2005, p. 75</ref> applying his categorisation of hands into 'styles', 'stylistic classes' or 'graphic types' as appropriate.  Orsini and Clarysse propose dates for New Testament papyri that are often rather later than the consensus dates in the Nestle-Aland lists,<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 466\">Orsini, p. 466.</ref> and considerably later than the counterpart dates proposed by Comfort and Barrett.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 445\">Orsini, p. 445.</ref> They criticise Don Barker for assigning dates they regard as extending too early;<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 460\">Orsini, p. 460.</ref> the dating ranges they themselves propose for New Testament papyri are never wider than 100 years, more frequently 50 years, and for several early papyri ([[Papyrus 46|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>46</sup>]], [[Papyrus 95|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>95</sup>]], [[Papyrus 64|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>64+67</sup>]]) they propose purely paleographic dates within a 25-year range.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 470\">Orsini, p. 470.</ref> In their paper Orsini and Clarysse state that the early parallels proposed for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> by Comfort and Barrett are \"inappropriate\";<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 462\">Orsini, p. 462.</ref> and, although they cite with approval Nongbri's assessment of the respective papyrological dating approaches adopted by Grenfell, Hunt and Roberts, they do not cite his specific study of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, and none of his proposed later parallels feature in their list of stylistically similar comparators; nor do any of other papyri advanced by Barker as representatives of his proposed graphic stream.  Of the papyri discussed by Roberts and his correspondents, and in contradiction to Barker, Orsini and Clarysse maintain Kenyon's proposed dated parallel, P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE) as corresponding to the same \"Round Chancery Script\" graphic type as <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>.<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 458\">Orsini, p. 458.</ref> Two further comparators they propose are PSI V 446, the official proclamation of an edict of the prefect Petronius dated 132-137 CE; and P. Fayum 87, a municipal receipt dated 156 CE;<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 462\">Orsini, p. 462.</ref> while they also note, as other commentators have done, the close similarity of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> to [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] for which they propose a date of 100-200 CE.  Consequently, Orsini and Clarysse propose 125 to 175 CE as the range of dates for <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>;<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 470\">Orsini, p. 470.</ref> which corresponds with the \"mid second century\" date proposed Stanley Porter, is much narrower than the ranges envisaged by Barker or Nongbri, and implies within their dating schema that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> and [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] stand as the earliest New Testament papyri so far identified (although, strangely, at the conclusion of their article, Orsini and Clarysse state that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup>, [[Papyrus 90|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>90</sup>]], and [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] \"probably all [date to] the second half of the second century).\"<ref name=\"Orsini, p. 466\">Orsini, p. 466.</ref>\n\n=== John Rylands Library ===\n\nThe John Rylands Library states \"The first editor dated the Fragment to the first half of the second century (between 100-150 AD). The date was estimated palaeographically, by comparing the handwriting with other manuscripts. However, palaeography is not an exact science - none of the comparable Biblical manuscripts are dated and most papyri bearing a secure date are administrative documents. Recent research points to a date nearer to 200 AD, but there is as yet no convincing evidence that any earlier fragments from the New Testament survive.\"<ref>http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/guide-to-special-collections/st-john-fragment/</ref>\n\n== Text-critical and historical significance ==\n\nFinds of early Christian papyri from Egypt represent the earliest surviving indisputable physical evidence for Christianity and the Christian Gospel.<ref>Larry W. Hurtado, ''The Earliest Christian Artefacts: Manuscripts and Christian Origins'', Grand Rapids; Eerdemans, 2006,</ref> There is a considerable degree of overlap in the proposed ranges of dates for these papyri and consequently it cannot be stated categorically that <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is earlier than other New Testament fragments of apparent 2nd century date; [[Papyrus 90|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>90</sup>]], [[Papyrus 104|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>104</sup>]] or perhaps [[Papyrus 64|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>64+67</sup>]]; nor that it is earlier than some early apocryphal texts; [[Egerton Gospel|P. Egerton. 2]], P.Oxy. LX 4009. There are in addition a number of papyrus fragments of Old Testament books in Greek (chiefly Psalms) which have also been dated to the 2nd century, and whose characteristics have been advanced as indicating a Christian, rather than Jewish or pagan, origin.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall, ''Early Christian Books in Egypt'', Princeton; Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 11-12</ref> Nevertheless; since all of these papyri have been dated paleographically, and mostly with reference to the same dated documentary comparators, they may be considered as a manuscript cluster whose estimated dates will vary as a group; amongst which <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is commonly recognised as having earlier features.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall, ''Early Christian Books in Egypt'', Princeton; Princeton University Press, 2009, pp. 12-15</ref> Moreover, and small though it is, the text that survives in <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is sufficient to provide early witness to a number of key historical claims about the [[Historical Jesus]], albeit that it does not include his actual name.  But in these verses we find a man tried before the Roman authorities at a specific date (the governorship of Pontius Pilate), at a specific place (the Praetorium in Jerusalem), sentenced to a specific death (crucifixion), and all at the instigation of the Jewish Temple authorities.\n\nIf the early 2nd century dating of the <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> is in fact correct, then the fact that the fragment is from a [[codex]] rather than a [[scroll]] would testify to the very early adoption of this mode of writing amongst Christians, in stark contrast to the apparent practice of contemporary [[Judaism]]. Furthermore, an assessment of the length of 'missing' text between the recto and verso readings corresponds with that in the counterpart canonical Gospel of John; and hence confirms that there are unlikely to have been substantial additions or deletions in this whole portion. Other than two [[iotacism]]s (\u0397\u039c'''''\u0395'''''\u0399\u039d, '''''\u0399'''''\u03a3\u0397\u039b\u0398\u0395\u039d), and in the probable omission of the second \u0395\u0399\u03a3 \u03a4\u039f\u03a5\u03a4\u039f from line 2 of the verso, <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>52</sup> agrees with the Alexandrian text base. In lines 4 and 5 of the recto the reconstructed text reads \u03a0\u0391\u039b\u0399\u039d \u0395\u0399\u03a3 \u03a4\u039f \u03a0\u03a1\u0391\u0399\u03a4\u03a9\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u039d \u039f \u03a0\u0399\u039b\u0391\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 in agreement with [[Papyrus 66|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>66</sup>]] and with the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] whereas the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus]] and the [[Majority Text]] all have the alternative word order; \u0395\u0399\u03a3 \u03a4\u039f \u03a0\u03a1\u0391\u0399\u03a4\u03a9\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u039d \u03a0\u0391\u039b\u0399\u039d \u039f \u03a0\u0399\u039b\u0391\u03a4\u039f\u03a3,<ref name=\"Roberts(1935), p. 29\">Roberts(1935), p. 29.</ref> but this is hardly a significant variant.

To set them apart, costume designer Ren\u00e9e April chose iridescent colors, pale shades, and a heavy usage of pearl and silver for the people of the sky, and chose an [[Italian Renaissance]] color palette (gold, ochre, Venetian blue, turquoise green) for the people of the earth.  Zed, who united this group, was clad in darted, all-white [[organza]], and his outfit was reminiscent of a [[Pierrot]]. Djinn, who was part of the earth group, wore an outfit made of a stretch silicone material. The neckline had a type of gold leaf [[appliqu\u00e9]] to resemble an [[Inca civilization|Inca]] or [[Aztec]] necklace.

This act represented the air.\n* [[High wire]]: A trio of performers walked a high wire precariously, the wire was in the border of the sky world and the earth world.\n* [[Juggling]]: A group of men representing the earth juggled clubs, discs and even fire clubs.\n* Banquine: A large group of acrobats were flung high in the air by porters, and created high human towers.\n* [[Aerial straps|Straps]]: Two women, each representing the different worlds performed tricks in perfect synchronisation.\n* Batons: A world champion baton twirler spun and threw up to three batons at a time,\n* Hand to hand: A woman of the sky and a man if the earth united in this touching balancing act.\n* [[Flying trapeze]]: Artists swung between four trapezes, performing flips throughout. Since 2012, this version of the act (along with its music) has been performed in [[Myst\u00e8re (Cirque du Soleil)|Mystere]], another resident Cirque show in [[Las Vegas]].\n* Charivari: The worlds united, and every act came together in this amazing finale.\n\n==Costumes==\nCentral to ''Zed'''s theme was the uniting of the people from the earth and sky.  To set them apart, costume designer Ren\u00e9e April chose iridescent colors, pale shades, and a heavy usage of pearl and silver for the people of the sky, and chose an [[Italian Renaissance]] color palette (gold, ochre, Venetian blue, turquoise green) for the people of the earth.  Zed, who united this group, was clad in darted, all-white [[organza]], and his outfit was reminiscent of a [[Pierrot]]. Djinn, who was part of the earth group, wore an outfit made of a stretch silicone material. The neckline had a type of gold leaf [[appliqu\u00e9]] to resemble an [[Inca civilization|Inca]] or [[Aztec]] necklace.  The torso, upper body, and arms had [[tattoo]] designs printed on the silicone material.<ref>{{cite book |title= Cirque du Soleil 25 Years of Costumes |last= Cl\u00e9ment |first= Ronald |year= 2009 |publisher= D\u00e9p\u00f4t l\u00e9gal, Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada |location= Canada |isbn= 978-2-9803493-4-8 |page= |pages= 126\u2013131 |language= zh, en, fr, ja}}</ref>\n\nAdditional highlights of the costumes included the following.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static01.cirquedusoleil.com/en/~/media/press/PDF/zed/zed-costume.pdf|title=ZED - About the Costumes|accessdate=2011-11-01|format=PDF|publisher=Cirque du Soleil|work=ZED - Press Material}}</ref>\n* Nouit was fitted with 14 wings.

There is an on-screen timer showing the day.  The following is a linear summary of the plot.}}\n\nOn January 8, Tom Hansen meets Summer Finn, his boss' new assistant. Tom is trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. After discovering they have a similar taste in music, they have a conversation about love at a [[karaoke]] night; Tom believes in it, but Summer does not. Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie drunkenly reveals that Tom likes Summer, which Tom asserts is only \"as friends\", something Summer agrees with. A few days later, Summer kisses Tom in the office. During the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer.\n\nTom shows Summer his favorite spot in the city, a park bench which overlooks a number of buildings he likes, though the view is somewhat spoiled by parking lots. After several months of dating, both Tom's friends and his preteen half-sister Rachel push him to question Summer where they are in their relationship, though Summer brushes this off, saying that it should not matter if they are both happy. One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick up Summer in a bar, which causes their first argument. They make up and Summer concedes Tom deserves some certainty, but that his demand that she promises to always feel the same way about him would be impossible for anyone to make.\n\nOn day 290, they are hanging out in a cafe. Tom wants to go back to Summer's place but she insists on seeing ''[[The Graduate]]'' and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he'd always thought it was a romantic fairy tale. They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost interest in Tom, and kisses him good night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Tom is horrified and begins to sink into depression.\n\nSummer quits her job at the greeting card company. Tom's boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is making him unsuitable for happier events. Tom goes on a blind date with a woman named Alison. The date does not go well as he spends it complaining about Summer until an exasperated Alison ends up taking Summer's side. Months later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. They have a good time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet. She invites Tom to a party at her apartment and falls asleep on Tom's shoulder on the train ride back. He attends the party hoping to rekindle their relationship but barely gets to talk to Summer and spends most of the night drinking alone, until he spots her engagement ring. Tom leaves, close to tears. He enters a deep depression, only leaving his apartment for alcohol and junk food. After a few days, he returns to work with a hangover and, after an emotional outburst, quits his job. Rachel tells Tom that she does not believe Summer was \"the one\" and that his depression is being worsened by the fact that he is [[Euphoric recall|only looking back on the positive aspects]] of their relationship.\n\nOne day he suddenly finds the energy to get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. He informs her that he left the office, and notes that she got married, which he admits he doesn't understand since she never even wanted to be someone's girlfriend. Summer says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom.  When Tom asserts that he was wrong about true love existing, she counters that he was actually right about it, he was just wrong about it being with her. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.\n\nTwelve days later, on Wednesday, May 23, Tom attends a job interview and meets a girl who is also applying for the same job. He finds that she shares his favorite spot and dislike for the parking lots. As he is entering the interview, he invites her for coffee afterwards. She politely declines, then changes her mind. Her name is Autumn. \n<!-- Do not add references to \"the counter\" -->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Tom Hansen, a trained architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Summer Finn, assistant to Tom's boss.\n* [[Geoffrey Arend]] as McKenzie, Tom's co-worker at the greeting card company.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Rachel Hansen, Tom's younger half-sister.\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Paul, one of Tom's friends.\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Vance, Tom's boss.\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Millie\n* [[Rachel Boston]] as Alison, Tom's blind date.\n* [[Minka Kelly]] as Autumn\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as Rhoda\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Vance's New Secretary\n* Olivia Bagg as Young Summer\n* [[Richard McGonagle]] as Narrator\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe film is presented as a non-linear narrative.

Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the [[London School of Economics]] in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell \"crazily, madly, hopelessly in love\" with the girl who \"returned his kisses but not his ardor.\" The ending of the relationship was \"painfully and unforgettably awful,\" which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Suck on it, Jenny Beckman \n| url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer \n| work = Salon \n| last = Williams \n| first = Mary Elizabeth \n| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5jxwVeJ5z?url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer/ \n| archive-date = September 22, 2009 \n| url-status = dead \n| accessdate = September 2, 2019\n| df = mdy \n}}</ref> Weber also stated that, \"we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way to tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place.

He stated, \"We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be something you could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title \u2013 it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you.

Summer's not a girl, she's a phase.\"<ref name=\"Eva\" /> Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. \"I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was.

There is an on-screen timer showing the day.  The following is a linear summary of the plot.}}\n\nOn January 8, Tom Hansen meets Summer Finn, his boss' new assistant. Tom is trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. After discovering they have a similar taste in music, they have a conversation about love at a [[karaoke]] night; Tom believes in it, but Summer does not. Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie drunkenly reveals that Tom likes Summer, which Tom asserts is only \"as friends\", something Summer agrees with. A few days later, Summer kisses Tom in the office. During the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer.\n\nTom shows Summer his favorite spot in the city, a park bench which overlooks a number of buildings he likes, though the view is somewhat spoiled by parking lots. After several months of dating, both Tom's friends and his preteen half-sister Rachel push him to question Summer where they are in their relationship, though Summer brushes this off, saying that it should not matter if they are both happy. One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick up Summer in a bar, which causes their first argument. They make up and Summer concedes Tom deserves some certainty, but that his demand that she promises to always feel the same way about him would be impossible for anyone to make.\n\nOn day 290, they are hanging out in a cafe. Tom wants to go back to Summer's place but she insists on seeing ''[[The Graduate]]'' and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he'd always thought it was a romantic fairy tale. They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost interest in Tom, and kisses him good night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Tom is horrified and begins to sink into depression.\n\nSummer quits her job at the greeting card company. Tom's boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is making him unsuitable for happier events. Tom goes on a blind date with a woman named Alison. The date does not go well as he spends it complaining about Summer until an exasperated Alison ends up taking Summer's side. Months later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. They have a good time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet. She invites Tom to a party at her apartment and falls asleep on Tom's shoulder on the train ride back. He attends the party hoping to rekindle their relationship but barely gets to talk to Summer and spends most of the night drinking alone, until he spots her engagement ring. Tom leaves, close to tears. He enters a deep depression, only leaving his apartment for alcohol and junk food. After a few days, he returns to work with a hangover and, after an emotional outburst, quits his job. Rachel tells Tom that she does not believe Summer was \"the one\" and that his depression is being worsened by the fact that he is [[Euphoric recall|only looking back on the positive aspects]] of their relationship.\n\nOne day he suddenly finds the energy to get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. He informs her that he left the office, and notes that she got married, which he admits he doesn't understand since she never even wanted to be someone's girlfriend. Summer says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom.  When Tom asserts that he was wrong about true love existing, she counters that he was actually right about it, he was just wrong about it being with her. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.\n\nTwelve days later, on Wednesday, May 23, Tom attends a job interview and meets a girl who is also applying for the same job. He finds that she shares his favorite spot and dislike for the parking lots. As he is entering the interview, he invites her for coffee afterwards. She politely declines, then changes her mind. Her name is Autumn. \n<!-- Do not add references to \"the counter\" -->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Tom Hansen, a trained architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Summer Finn, assistant to Tom's boss.\n* [[Geoffrey Arend]] as McKenzie, Tom's co-worker at the greeting card company.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Rachel Hansen, Tom's younger half-sister.\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Paul, one of Tom's friends.\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Vance, Tom's boss.\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Millie\n* [[Rachel Boston]] as Alison, Tom's blind date.\n* [[Minka Kelly]] as Autumn\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as Rhoda\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Vance's New Secretary\n* Olivia Bagg as Young Summer\n* [[Richard McGonagle]] as Narrator\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe film is presented as a non-linear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is.<ref>{{cite web|title=''500 Days of...''

Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the [[London School of Economics]] in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell \"crazily, madly, hopelessly in love\" with the girl who \"returned his kisses but not his ardor.\" The ending of the relationship was \"painfully and unforgettably awful,\" which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Suck on it, Jenny Beckman \n| url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer \n| work = Salon \n| last = Williams \n| first = Mary Elizabeth \n| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5jxwVeJ5z?url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/08/31/500_days_of_bummer/ \n| archive-date = September 22, 2009 \n| url-status = dead \n| accessdate = September 2, 2019\n| df = mdy \n}}</ref> Weber also stated that, \"we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way to tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy\".<ref name=\"Eva\" />\n\n=== Direction ===\nDirector Marc Webb has described the film as more of a \"[[coming of age]]\" story as opposed to a \"[[romantic comedy|rom-com]]\". He stated, \"We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be something you could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title \u2013 it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt\".<ref name=\"Eva\">{{cite news\n| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/500-days-of-summer\n| title='Is there such a thing as \"the one\" \u2013 and what happens if you lose her?\n| work=The Guardian\n| last=Wiseman\n| first=Eva\n| accessdate=August 16, 2009\n| location=London\n| date=August 16, 2009\n}}</ref>\nWebb also stated that Deschanel's character, Summer, is based on a [[stock character]] type; \"Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase.\"<ref name=\"Eva\" /> Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. \"I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about ''500 Days of Summer'' is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny\".<ref name=\"Eva\" />\n\n=== Filming locations ===\n[[File:Bradbury building Los Angeles c2005 01383u crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photograph of a building interior showing stairs climbing up five storeys to the final floor where we can see the glass roof.|The [[Bradbury Building]] in Los Angeles was a filming location.]]\nDavid Ng of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describes architecture as a star of the film.<ref name=\"DavidNg\" />\nTom is seen reading [[Alain de Botton]]'s ''[[The Architecture of Happiness]]''.\nThe film was originally set in San Francisco but was later moved to Los Angeles and the script rewritten to make better use of the location.<ref name=\"LACurbed\">{{cite web\n| url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2009/06/tk.php\n| title=Screenwriter explains ''500 Days'' Focus on Architecture, Downtown LA\n| work=Curbed LA\n| last=Gluck\n| first=Marissa\n| accessdate=June 8, 2009\n}}\n</ref> Buildings used include the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] (which includes the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]]) and the towers of [[One California Plaza|California Plaza]].<ref name=\"DavidNg\">{{cite news\n| author=David Ng\n| date=June 9, 2009\n| title=Downtown L.A. architecture stars in ''500 Days of Summer''\n| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/06/500-days-of-summer-frank-gehry-architecture-joseph-gordonlevitt-zooey-deschanel.html\n| work=Los Angeles Times\n| accessdate=January 8, 2010\n}}</ref>\nThe older [[Fine Arts Building (Los Angeles)|Fine Arts Building]] is featured in the film, in a scene where Tom shows it to Summer and mentions its designers, [[Walker & Eisen|Walker and Eisen]], two of his favorite architects, although he incorrectly gives the partners' names as \"Walker and Eisner.\"\n\nChristopher Hawthorne of the ''Los Angeles Times'' describes the film as having \"finely honed sense of taste\" to include the [[Bradbury Building]] where Tom goes for his job interview.<ref name=\"LATimes\">{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Christopher |title=L.A. as filtered by love in ''500 Days of Summer'' |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-500days-2009jul31,0,3332091.story |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |date=July 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=July 30, 2009 |first=Christopher |last=Hawthorne |title=500 Days of architecture |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/07/500-days-of-architecture.html |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=January 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTom\u2019s favourite spot in Los Angeles was shot at Angel's Knoll, which became a popular tourist attraction after the film\u2019s release.
