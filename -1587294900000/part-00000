He became 'portionist,' or postmaster, of [[Merton College, Oxford]], in 1589; proceeded B.A. on 20 June 1593; was admitted probationer fellow there in 1594, and took the degree of M.A. on 31 October 1598. He was [[proctor]] of the university in 1607, and admitted [[bachelor of law]] on 11 October 1623.<ref name = DNB>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Brent, Nathaniel|volume=6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1613 and 1614 he travelled abroad, securing the Italian text of the ''History of the Council of Trent'' which he was to translate. In 1616 he was in [[the Hague]] with [[Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester|Dudley Carleton]], ambassador there, who wrote about Brent's ambitions to [[Ralph Winwood]]. Soon after the close of his foreign tour Brent married Martha, the daughter and heiress of [[Robert Abbot, Bishop of Salisbury]], and niece of [[George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nThe influence of the Abbots secured Brent's election in 1622 to the wardenship of Merton College, in succession to [[Sir Henry Savile]]. He was afterwards appointed commissary of the [[diocese of Canterbury]], and vicar-general to the archbishop, and on [[Sir Henry Marten]]'s death became judge of the prerogative court. During the early years of [[William Laud]]'s primacy (1634\u20137), Brent made a tour through England south of the [[River Trent|Trent]], acting for the archbishop in his metropolitical visitation of the province of Canterbury, reporting upon and correcting ecclesiastical abuses.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nHe had a house of his own in [[Little Britain, London|Little Britain]], London and was often absent from Merton. On 23 August 1629 he was knighted at [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]] by [[Charles I of England]], who was preparing to pay a state visit to Oxford. In August 1636 Brent presented [[Charles II of England|Prince Charles]] and [[Prince Rupert]] for degrees, when Laud, who had become [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford]] in 1630, was entertaining the royal family.\n\nIn 1638 Laud held a visitation of Merton College, and insisted on many radical reforms. Laud stayed at the college for many weeks, and found Brent an obstinate opponent. Charges of maladministration were brought against Brent by some of those whom Laud examined, but he took no public proceedings against Brent on these grounds. His letters to the warden are, however, couched in very haughty and decisive language. The tenth charge in the indictment drawn up Laud in 1641 treats of the unlawful authority exercised by him at Merton in 1638. Brent came forward as a hostile witness at [[Laud's trial]]. His testimony as to Laud's intimacy with papists and the like was damaging to the archbishop, but it did not add to his own reputation. Laud replied in writing to Brent's accusations.<ref name = DNB/><ref>In his 'History of the Troubles and Trial' (''Anglo-Cath. Libr.'' iv. 194).</ref>\n\nOn the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]] Brent sided with Parliament. Before Charles I entered Oxford (29 October 1642), he had abandoned Oxford for London. On 27 January 1645 Charles I wrote to the remaining Fellows at Merton that Brent was deposed from his office on the grounds of his having absented himself for three years from the college, of having adhered to the rebels, and of having accepted the office of [[judge-marshal]] in their ranks. He had also signed the [[Solemn League and Covenant]]. The petition for the formal removal of Brent, to which the king's letter was an answer, was drawn up by [[John Greaves]], [[Savilian professor of geometry]]. On 9 April [[William Harvey]] was elected to fill Brent's place: but as soon as Oxford fell into the hands of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], the parliamentary general (24 June 1646), Brent returned to Merton, and apparently resumed his post there without any opposition being offered him.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nIn 1647 Brent was appointed president of the parliamentary commission, or visitation, ordered by Parliament \"for the correction of offences, abuses, and disorders\" in the [[University of Oxford]]. The proceedings began on 3 June, but it was not until 30 September that the colleges were directed to forward to Merton their statutes, registers, and accounts to enable Brent and his colleagues to set to work. On 12 April 1648 Brent presented four of the visitors for the degree of M.A. Early in May of the same year Brent spoke for [[Anthony \u00e0 Wood]]'s retention of his postmastership in spite of his avowed royalism. Wood wrote that he owed this favour to the intercession of his mother, whom Brent had known from a girl.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nOn 17 May 1649 Fairfax and [[Oliver Cromwell]] paid the university a threatening visit, and malcontents were thenceforth proceeded against by the commission with rigour. But Brent grew dissatisfied with its proceedings. The visitors claimed to rule Merton College as they pleased, and, without consulting the Warden, they admitted fellows, Masters, and Bachelors of Arts. On 13 February 1651 he sent a petition of protest against the conduct of the visitors to parliament. The commissioners were ordered to answer Brent's complaint, but there is no evidence that they did so, and in October 1651 Brent retired from the commission. On 27 November following he resigned his office of Warden, nominally in obedience to an order forbidding pluralities, but his refusal to sign 'the engagement,' a statement of loyalty, was a probable cause of his resignation.

These are usually retrospectively-gated and have intrinsically high contrast in cardiac imaging due to the relatively high T2:T1 ratio of blood compared to myocardium. Images are typically planned sequentially to achieve the standard cardiac planes used for assessment. Turbulent flow causes dephasing and signal loss allowing valvular disease to be qualitatively appreciated. The left ventricular short axis cines are acquired from base to apex and are used for quantifying [[End-diastolic volume|end-diastolic]] and [[End-systolic volume|end-systolic]] volumes, as well as myocardial mass.

Accurate diagnosis is essential for the development of appropriate treatment plans.  CMR can provide comprehensive information about the nature of congenital hearts defects in a safe fashion without using x-rays or entering the body.   It is rarely used as the first or sole diagnostic test for congenital heart disease.\n\nRather, it is typically used in concert with other diagnostic techniques.  In general, the clinical reasons for a CMR examination fall into one or more of the following categories: (1) when [[echocardiography]] (cardiac ultrasound) cannot provide sufficient diagnostic information, (2) as an alternative to diagnostic cardiac catheterization which involve risks including x-ray radiation exposure, (3) to obtain diagnostic information for which CMR offers unique advantages such as blood flow measurement or identification of cardiac masses, and (4) when clinical assessment and other diagnostic tests are inconsistent.  Examples of conditions in which CMR is often used include [[tetralogy of Fallot]], [[transposition of the great arteries]], [[coarctation of the aorta]], single ventricle heart disease, abnormalities of the pulmonary veins, [[atrial septal defect]], connective tissue diseases such as [[Marfan syndrome]], [[vascular rings]], abnormal origins of the coronary arteries, and cardiac tumors.\n\n[[Image:Secundum ASD cine.gif|x120px]]\n\n<small>Atrial septal defect with dilation of the right ventricle by CMR</small>\n\n[[Image:PAPVR.gif|x170px]]\n\n<small>Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Drainage by CMR</small>\n\nCMR examinations in children typically last 15 to 60 minutes.  In order to avoid blurry images the child must remain very still during the examination.  Different institutions have different protocols for pediatric CMR, but most children 7 years of age and older can cooperate sufficiently for a good quality examination.  Providing an age-appropriate explanation of the procedure to the child in advance will increase the likelihood of a successful study.  After proper safety screening, parents can be allowed into the MRI scanner room to help their child complete the examination.  Some centers allow children to listen to music or watch movies through a specialized MRI-compatible audiovisual system to reduce anxiety and improve cooperation.  However, the presence of a calm, encouraging, supportive parent generally produces better results in terms of pediatric cooperation than any distraction or entertainment strategy short of sedation.

Further investigation laid out the principles of relaxation times leading to nuclear [[spectroscopy]]. In 1971, there was the first report of the difference of the relaxation times for water in myocardium and pure water in spin-echo NMR by Hazlewood and [[Donald C.

In 1973, the first simple NMR image was published and the first medical imaging in 1977, entering the clinical arena in the early 1980s. In 1984, NMR medical imaging was renamed MRI. Initial attempts to image the heart were confounded by respiratory and cardiac motion, solved by using cardiac ECG gating, faster scan techniques and breath hold imaging. Increasingly sophisticated techniques were developed including cine imaging and techniques to characterise [[heart]] muscle as normal or abnormal (fat infiltration, oedematous, iron loaded, acutely infarcted or fibrosed).\n\nAs MRI became more complex and application to cardiovascular imaging became more sophisticated, the [[Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance|SCMR]] was set up (1996) with an academic journal, (JCMR) in 1999. In a move analogous to the development of \u2018[[echocardiography]]\u2019 from cardiac ultrasound, the term \u2018Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance\u2019 (CMR) was proposed and has gained acceptance as the name for the field.\n\n==Training==\nCertification of competency in CMR can be obtained at three levels, with different requirements for each.

Accurate diagnosis is essential for the development of appropriate treatment plans.  CMR can provide comprehensive information about the nature of congenital hearts defects in a safe fashion without using x-rays or entering the body.   It is rarely used as the first or sole diagnostic test for congenital heart disease.\n\nRather, it is typically used in concert with other diagnostic techniques.  In general, the clinical reasons for a CMR examination fall into one or more of the following categories: (1) when [[echocardiography]] (cardiac ultrasound) cannot provide sufficient diagnostic information, (2) as an alternative to diagnostic cardiac catheterization which involve risks including x-ray radiation exposure, (3) to obtain diagnostic information for which CMR offers unique advantages such as blood flow measurement or identification of cardiac masses, and (4) when clinical assessment and other diagnostic tests are inconsistent.  Examples of conditions in which CMR is often used include [[tetralogy of Fallot]], [[transposition of the great arteries]], [[coarctation of the aorta]], single ventricle heart disease, abnormalities of the pulmonary veins, [[atrial septal defect]], connective tissue diseases such as [[Marfan syndrome]], [[vascular rings]], abnormal origins of the coronary arteries, and cardiac tumors.\n\n[[Image:Secundum ASD cine.gif|x120px]]\n\n<small>Atrial septal defect with dilation of the right ventricle by CMR</small>\n\n[[Image:PAPVR.gif|x170px]]\n\n<small>Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Drainage by CMR</small>\n\nCMR examinations in children typically last 15 to 60 minutes.  In order to avoid blurry images the child must remain very still during the examination.  Different institutions have different protocols for pediatric CMR, but most children 7 years of age and older can cooperate sufficiently for a good quality examination.  Providing an age-appropriate explanation of the procedure to the child in advance will increase the likelihood of a successful study.  After proper safety screening, parents can be allowed into the MRI scanner room to help their child complete the examination.  Some centers allow children to listen to music or watch movies through a specialized MRI-compatible audiovisual system to reduce anxiety and improve cooperation.  However, the presence of a calm, encouraging, supportive parent generally produces better results in terms of pediatric cooperation than any distraction or entertainment strategy short of sedation.  If the child cannot cooperate sufficiently, sedation with intravenous medications or general anesthesia may be necessary.  In very young babies, it may be possible to perform the examination while they are in a natural sleep. New image capture techniques such as 4D flow require a shorter scan and can lead to reduced needs for sedation.\n\n[[Image:RVpoorfunctiondragcomp.gif|x120px]]\n\n<small>Enlarged right ventricle with poor function in a patient with repaired tetralogy of Fallot by CMR</small>\n\n==Different cardiac-capable magnet types==\nThe majority of CMR is performed on conventional superconducting MRI systems at either [[Tesla (unit)|1.5T]] or 3T.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/cib_mri_equipment_report.pdf|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Equipment, Operations and Planning in the NHS|last=|first=|date=2017-04-01|website=Royal College of Radiologists|access-date=2018-02-25}}</ref>   Imaging at 3T field strength offers greater [[Signal-to-noise ratio|signal to noise]] ratio which can be traded for improved temporal or spatial resolution - which is of greatest utility in first-pass perfusion studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ripley|first=David P.|last2=Brown|first2=Julia M.|last3=Everett|first3=Colin C.|last4=Bijsterveld|first4=Petra|last5=Walker|first5=Simon|last6=Sculpher|first6=Mark|last7=McCann|first7=Gerry P.|last8=Berry|first8=Colin|last9=Plein|first9=Sven|title=Rationale and design of the Clinical Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Coronary heart disease 2 trial (CE-MARC 2): A prospective, multicenter, randomized trial of diagnostic strategies in suspected coronary heart disease|journal=American Heart Journal|volume=169|issue=1|pages=17\u201324.e1|doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2014.10.008|pmid=25497243|pmc=4277294|year=2015}}</ref>   However, greater capital costs and effects of off-resonance artefact on image quality mean that many studies are routinely performed at 1.5T.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajiah|first=Prabhakar|last2=Bolen|first2=Michael A.|date=October 2014|title=Cardiovascular MR imaging at 3 T: opportunities, challenges, and solutions|journal=Radiographics|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1612\u20131635|doi=10.1148/rg.346140048|issn=1527-1323|pmid=25310420}}</ref> Imaging at 7T field strength is a growing area of research, but is not widely available.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niendorf|first=Thoralf|last2=Sodickson|first2=Daniel K.|last3=Krombach|first3=Gabriele A.|last4=Schulz-Menger|first4=Jeanette|date=2010-12-01|title=Toward cardiovascular MRI at 7 T: clinical needs, technical solutions and research promises|journal=European Radiology|volume=20|issue=12|pages=2806\u20132816|doi=10.1007/s00330-010-1902-8|pmid=20676653|issn=0938-7994|pmc=3044088}}</ref>\n\nCurrent manufacturers of cardiac-capable MRI scanners include Philips, Siemens, Hitachi, Toshiba, GE.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of magnetic resonance imaging}}\nThe phenomenon of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) was first described in molecular beams (1938) and bulk matter (1946), work later acknowledged by the award of a joint [[Nobel prize]] in 1952. Further investigation laid out the principles of relaxation times leading to nuclear [[spectroscopy]]. In 1971, there was the first report of the difference of the relaxation times for water in myocardium and pure water in spin-echo NMR by Hazlewood and [[Donald C. Chang|Chang]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hazlewood|first=C. F.|last2=Chang|first2=D. C.|last3=Nichols|first3=B. L.|last4=Rorschach|first4=H.

In 1973, the first simple NMR image was published and the first medical imaging in 1977, entering the clinical arena in the early 1980s. In 1984, NMR medical imaging was renamed MRI. Initial attempts to image the heart were confounded by respiratory and cardiac motion, solved by using cardiac ECG gating, faster scan techniques and breath hold imaging. Increasingly sophisticated techniques were developed including cine imaging and techniques to characterise [[heart]] muscle as normal or abnormal (fat infiltration, oedematous, iron loaded, acutely infarcted or fibrosed).\n\nAs MRI became more complex and application to cardiovascular imaging became more sophisticated, the [[Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance|SCMR]] was set up (1996) with an academic journal, (JCMR) in 1999. In a move analogous to the development of \u2018[[echocardiography]]\u2019 from cardiac ultrasound, the term \u2018Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance\u2019 (CMR) was proposed and has gained acceptance as the name for the field.\n\n==Training==\nCertification of competency in CMR can be obtained at three levels, with different requirements for each. Level 3 requires 50 hours of approved courses, at least 300 studies performed, sitting a written examination and recommendation by a supervisor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Steffen E.|last2=Almeida|first2=Ana G.|last3=Alpendurada|first3=Francisco|last4=Boubertakh|first4=Redha|last5=Bucciarelli-Ducci|first5=Chiara|last6=Cosyns|first6=Bernard|last7=Greil|first7=Gerald F.|last8=Karamitsos|first8=Theodoros D.|last9=Lancellotti|first9=Patrizio|date=July 2014|title=Update of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) Core Syllabus for the European Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Certification Exam|journal=European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging|volume=15|issue=7|pages=728\u2013729|doi=10.1093/ehjci/jeu076|issn=2047-2412|pmid=24855220|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.scmr.org The Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance]\n* [http://jcmr-online.com The Journal for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090428113914/http://atlas.scmr.org/cineplayer.html An Atlas of normal cardiac structure and function by CMR]\n* [http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=cardiacmr&bhcp=1 Having a CMR scan]\n* [http://www.emedicine.com/Radio/topic866.htm Cardiac MRI technical primer]\n* [http://Revisemri.com ReviseMRI.com]\n* [http://www.hull.ac.uk/mri/lectures/gpl_page.html Hull physics lecture series]\n* [http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/ the basics of MRI]\n* [http://www.mritutor.org/mritutor/ MRI tutor]\n\n{{Cardiac procedures}}\n{{Medical imaging}}\n\n[[Category:Cardiac imaging]]\n[[Category:Magnetic resonance imaging]]\n", "name_user": "TimEijgenraam", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLate gadolinium enhancement", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"}

This they did, but found themselves besieged in the hastily constructed base, at a deserted [[Norway|Norwegian]] mission station. A relief column was organised, and under the leadership of [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] it departed [[Fort Tenedos]] on 29 March to march to Pearson's relief. The column composed 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans, and a range of artillery, including two 9-pounders (4&nbsp;kg), four 24-pounder (11&nbsp;kg) rocket tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s.<ref name=\"Theal-334\">{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=History of South Africa from 1795 to 1846 |publisher=Sonnenschein|location=London|date=1919|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofsafrica01theauoft/page/334 334]|chapter=XIV \u2013 The Zulu War|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsafrica01theauoft}}</ref> The progress was slow, as Chelmsford took a roundabout route to avoid ambush in the close country Pearson had previously passed through. In addition, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains and fearing a repeat of [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]], Chelmsford ensured his men spent much time [[laager]]ing and entrenching their camp at the end of each day.\n\nDespite this slow progress, Pearson's observers at Eshowe could see the relief column laagering on the south bank of the Inyezane on the evening of 1 April. The laager was sited on a 300-foot (100 m) ridge running roughly west\u2013east. West of the ridge, the ground dipped, only to rise again to the 470-foot (140 m) Umisi Hill. The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire. A trench surrounded a waist high wall of earth, which itself encompassed 120 wagons formed a square with sides of 130 yards (120 m) in length.\nWhile these defences were being constructed, a scout returned in the evening bearing news of Zulus massing on the far side of Umisi Hill. A second scouting party reported no forces there, but that an impi was camped to the north west of the laager. While the scouts could not assess the Zulu strength because of the darkness, this impi was in fact composed of 12,000 warriors, all of whom had been at Isandlwana. The impi had been ordered to ambush the relief column, and thwarted by Chelmsford already; this was their final chance to stop the column before it reached Eshowe. The night passed with no attack.\n\n==The battle==\n[[File:Men of the 57th Regiment entrenching a laager.jpg|thumb|Men of the [[57th Regiment of Foot|57th Regiment]] entrenching a laager.]]\nAt daybreak on 2 April 1879, the morning sun revealed a muddy and sodden ground and a heavy mist. Chelmsford could not move his wagons until the ground dried out, and so sent out the Natal Native Contingent to provoke the Zulus into an attack while he held a strong position. Once the mist lifted, the left horn of the impi was seen advancing eastwards over the river towards the British laager before disappearing into tall grass. A long burst of fire from one of the Gatling guns saw the warriors disappear into the long grass. When the left horn re-emerged it had joined the rest of the impi and the left horn, chest and right horn were advancing over Umisi Hill. The whole charging buffalo formation came in at a run on the three sides of the laager. This was the scenario Chelmsford had planned for, at a range of {{cvt|300|\u2013|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} the British infantry opened fire, supported by the Gatling guns and rockets.\n\nZulu marksmen caused a few casualties within the laager, but the defenders kept the Zulus at bay and Chelmsford's defence was working. Though the Zulu regiments made persistent rushes to get within stabbing range, their charges lacked the drive and spirit that had pushed them forward at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] and [[Rorke's Drift]]. The only Zulu to reach the laager was a 10-year-old boy, who was taken prisoner by members of the naval brigade and later served as a kind of mascotte on their ship, HMS Boadicea. After 20 minutes, the Zulu impi began to crumble away. Seeing this, Chelmsford ordered pursuit by the mounted troops and the native contingent. Large numbers of Zulu warriors were killed in this chase. By 07:30, the Zulus had fled and the grim task of killing Zulu wounded was undertaken. Around the laager 700 Zulu bodies were counted and 300 more were killed in the mounted chase of the retreating warriors. The British suffered eleven dead, including a lieutenant-colonel and 48 wounded.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe battle restored Chelmsford's confidence in his army and their ability to defeat Zulu attacks. With the last resistance between Chelmsford and Pearson's columns removed, he was able to advance and relieve [[Siege of Eshowe#Eshowe relieved|Eshowe]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|last=Barthorp|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barthorp|title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi|year=2002|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Brookes|first=Edgar H|authorlink=|author2=Webb, Colin de B.|title=A History of Natal|publisher=[[University of Natal Press]]|year=1965|location=[[Brooklyn]]|isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Colenso|first=Frances E.|others=Assisted by Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* {{Cite news|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=The Forgotten Battles of the Zulu War|newspaper=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=26\u201333|date=February 2009|url = }}\n* {{Cite book|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=Zulu, The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2005|isbn=0-14-101569-1}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

A relief column was organised, and under the leadership of [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] it departed [[Fort Tenedos]] on 29 March to march to Pearson's relief. The column composed 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans, and a range of artillery, including two 9-pounders (4&nbsp;kg), four 24-pounder (11&nbsp;kg) rocket tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s.<ref name=\"Theal-334\">{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=History of South Africa from 1795 to 1846 |publisher=Sonnenschein|location=London|date=1919|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofsafrica01theauoft/page/334 334]|chapter=XIV \u2013 The Zulu War|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsafrica01theauoft}}</ref> The progress was slow, as Chelmsford took a roundabout route to avoid ambush in the close country Pearson had previously passed through. In addition, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains and fearing a repeat of [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]], Chelmsford ensured his men spent much time [[laager]]ing and entrenching their camp at the end of each day.\n\nDespite this slow progress, Pearson's observers at Eshowe could see the relief column laagering on the south bank of the Inyezane on the evening of 1 April. The laager was sited on a 300-foot (100 m) ridge running roughly west\u2013east. West of the ridge, the ground dipped, only to rise again to the 470-foot (140 m) Umisi Hill. The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire. A trench surrounded a waist high wall of earth, which itself encompassed 120 wagons formed a square with sides of 130 yards (120 m) in length.\nWhile these defences were being constructed, a scout returned in the evening bearing news of Zulus massing on the far side of Umisi Hill. A second scouting party reported no forces there, but that an impi was camped to the north west of the laager. While the scouts could not assess the Zulu strength because of the darkness, this impi was in fact composed of 12,000 warriors, all of whom had been at Isandlwana. The impi had been ordered to ambush the relief column, and thwarted by Chelmsford already; this was their final chance to stop the column before it reached Eshowe. The night passed with no attack.\n\n==The battle==\n[[File:Men of the 57th Regiment entrenching a laager.jpg|thumb|Men of the [[57th Regiment of Foot|57th Regiment]] entrenching a laager.]]\nAt daybreak on 2 April 1879, the morning sun revealed a muddy and sodden ground and a heavy mist. Chelmsford could not move his wagons until the ground dried out, and so sent out the Natal Native Contingent to provoke the Zulus into an attack while he held a strong position. Once the mist lifted, the left horn of the impi was seen advancing eastwards over the river towards the British laager before disappearing into tall grass. A long burst of fire from one of the Gatling guns saw the warriors disappear into the long grass. When the left horn re-emerged it had joined the rest of the impi and the left horn, chest and right horn were advancing over Umisi Hill. The whole charging buffalo formation came in at a run on the three sides of the laager. This was the scenario Chelmsford had planned for, at a range of {{cvt|300|\u2013|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} the British infantry opened fire, supported by the Gatling guns and rockets.\n\nZulu marksmen caused a few casualties within the laager, but the defenders kept the Zulus at bay and Chelmsford's defence was working. Though the Zulu regiments made persistent rushes to get within stabbing range, their charges lacked the drive and spirit that had pushed them forward at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] and [[Rorke's Drift]]. The only Zulu to reach the laager was a 10-year-old boy, who was taken prisoner by members of the naval brigade and later served as a kind of mascotte on their ship, HMS Boadicea. After 20 minutes, the Zulu impi began to crumble away. Seeing this, Chelmsford ordered pursuit by the mounted troops and the native contingent. Large numbers of Zulu warriors were killed in this chase. By 07:30, the Zulus had fled and the grim task of killing Zulu wounded was undertaken. Around the laager 700 Zulu bodies were counted and 300 more were killed in the mounted chase of the retreating warriors. The British suffered eleven dead, including a lieutenant-colonel and 48 wounded.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe battle restored Chelmsford's confidence in his army and their ability to defeat Zulu attacks. With the last resistance between Chelmsford and Pearson's columns removed, he was able to advance and relieve [[Siege of Eshowe#Eshowe relieved|Eshowe]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military history of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* {{Cite book|last=Barthorp|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barthorp|title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi|year=2002|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Brookes|first=Edgar H|authorlink=|author2=Webb, Colin de B.|title=A History of Natal|publisher=[[University of Natal Press]]|year=1965|location=[[Brooklyn]]|isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Colenso|first=Frances E.|others=Assisted by Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* {{Cite news|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=The Forgotten Battles of the Zulu War|newspaper=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=26\u201333|date=February 2009|url = }}\n* {{Cite book|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=Zulu, The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2005|isbn=0-14-101569-1}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

The other species, ''M. jansenii'', produces poisonous nuts resulting from toxic amounts of [[Glycoside#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glycosides]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe macadamia tree is usually propagated by [[grafting]], and does not begin to produce commercial quantities of seeds until it is 7\u201310 years old, but once established, may continue bearing for over 100 years. Macadamias prefer fertile, well-drained soils, a rainfall of {{convert|1000|-|2000|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, and temperatures not falling below {{convert|10|C|F|sigfig=1}} (although once established, they can withstand light frosts), with an optimum temperature of {{convert|25|C|F|sigfig=1}}. The roots are shallow and trees can be blown down in storms; they are also susceptible to ''[[Phytophthora]]'' root disease.\n\n[[Image:Macadamia Beaumont.JPG|right|thumb|Macadamia 'Beaumont' in new growth]]\n\n==Cultivars==\n\n===Beaumont===\nA ''Macadamia integrifolia'' / ''M. tetraphylla'' hybrid commercial variety is widely planted in Australia and New Zealand; it was discovered by Dr. J. H. Beaumont. It is high in oil, but is not sweet. New leaves are reddish, and flowers are bright pink, borne on long racemes. It is one of the quickest varieties to come into bearing once planted in the garden, usually carrying a useful crop by the fourth year, and improving from then on. It crops prodigiously when well pollinated. The impressive, grape-like clusters are sometimes so heavy, they break the branchlets to which they are attached. In commercial orchards, it has reached {{convert|18|kg|abbr=on}} per tree by eight years old. On the downside, the macadamias do not drop from the tree when ripe, and the leaves are a bit prickly when one reaches into the interior of the tree during harvest. Its shell is easier to open than that of most commercial varieties.\n[[Image:Macadamia Maroochy.JPG|right|thumb|Macadamia 'Maroochy' new growth]]\n\n===Maroochy===\nA pure ''M. tetraphylla'' variety from Australia, this strain is cultivated for its productive crop yield, flavor, and suitability for pollinating 'Beaumont'.\n\n===Nelmac II===\nA South African ''M. integrifolia'' / ''M. tetraphylla'' hybrid cultivar, it has a sweet seed, which means it has to be cooked carefully so that the sugars do not caramelise. The sweet seed is usually not fully processed, as it generally does not taste as good, but many people enjoy eating it uncooked. It has an open micropyle (hole in the shell) which may let in mould. The crack-out percentage (ratio of nut meat to whole nut, by weight) is high. Ten-year-old trees average  {{convert|22|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} per tree. It is a popular variety because of its pollination of 'Beaumont', and the yields are almost comparable.\n\n===Renown===\nA ''M. integrifolia'' / ''M. tetraphylla'' hybrid, this is a rather spreading tree. On the plus side, it is high yielding commercially, {{convert|17|kg|abbr=on}} from a 9-year-old tree has been recorded, and the nuts drop to the ground. However, they are thick-shelled, with not much flavor.\n\n{{nutritionalvalue \n| name=Macadamia nuts, raw \n| kJ=3080 \n| fat=75.8 g \n| satfat=12 g\n| monofat=59 g\n| polyfat=1.5 g\n| protein=7.9 g\n| carbs=13.8 g \n| fiber=8.6 g\n| sugars=4.57 g \n| iron_mg=3.69 \n| calcium_mg=85 \n| magnesium_mg=130 \n| phosphorus_mg=188 \n| potassium_mg=368\n| manganese_mg=4.1\n| zinc_mg=1.30 \n| vitC_mg=1.2  \n| vitE_mg=0.54  \n| thiamin_mg=1.195 \n| riboflavin_mg=0.162 \n| niacin_mg=2.473\n| pantothenic_mg=0.76 \n| vitB6_mg=0.275\n| folate_ug=11\n| right=0 \n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3673?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=35&sort=&qlookup=Nuts%2C+macadamia&offset=&format=Full&new=&measureby= Full Link to USDA Database entry] \n}}\n==Production==\n\nIn 2018, [[South Africa]] was estimated to remain the world's leading producer of macadamia nuts with 54,000 tonnes out of global production of 211,000 tonnes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.agriorbit.com/more-and-more-macadamia-produced-globally-world-nut-conference/|title=More and more macadamia produced globally|last=Motaung|first=Ntswaki|date=2018-05-30|website=Agriorbit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> In 2015, South Africa produced {{convert|48,000|t|ST}} compared to Australia's 40,000 tonnes and the total global production of {{convert|160,000|t|ST}}.<ref name=\"fp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/137977/South-Africa-becomes-king-of-macadamia-nuts-again | title=South Africa becomes king of macadamia nuts again | publisher=FreshPlaza | date=14 April 2015 | accessdate=9 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010043705/http://www.freshplaza.com/article/137977/South-Africa-becomes-king-of-macadamia-nuts-again | archive-date=10 October 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Macadamia is also commercially produced in [[Brazil]], [[United States]] ([[California]] and [[Hawaii]] states), [[Costa Rica]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], [[China]], [[Bolivia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Malawi]].\n\nThe first commercial orchard of macadamia trees was planted in the early 1880s by Rous Mill, {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Lismore, New South Wales]], consisting of ''M. tetraphylla''.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Macadamia Power Pty | year=1982 | title=Macadamia Power in a Nutshell | publisher=Macadamia Power Pty Limited | page=13 | isbn=978-0-9592892-0-6}}</ref> Besides the development of a small boutique industry in Australia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, macadamia was extensively planted as a commercial crop in [[Hawaii]] from the 1920s.

Macadamias prefer fertile, well-drained soils, a rainfall of {{convert|1000|-|2000|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, and temperatures not falling below {{convert|10|C|F|sigfig=1}} (although once established, they can withstand light frosts), with an optimum temperature of {{convert|25|C|F|sigfig=1}}. The roots are shallow and trees can be blown down in storms; they are also susceptible to ''[[Phytophthora]]'' root disease.\n\n[[Image:Macadamia Beaumont.JPG|right|thumb|Macadamia 'Beaumont' in new growth]]\n\n==Cultivars==\n\n===Beaumont===\nA ''Macadamia integrifolia'' / ''M. tetraphylla'' hybrid commercial variety is widely planted in Australia and New Zealand; it was discovered by Dr. J. H. Beaumont. It is high in oil, but is not sweet. New leaves are reddish, and flowers are bright pink, borne on long racemes. It is one of the quickest varieties to come into bearing once planted in the garden, usually carrying a useful crop by the fourth year, and improving from then on. It crops prodigiously when well pollinated. The impressive, grape-like clusters are sometimes so heavy, they break the branchlets to which they are attached. In commercial orchards, it has reached {{convert|18|kg|abbr=on}} per tree by eight years old. On the downside, the macadamias do not drop from the tree when ripe, and the leaves are a bit prickly when one reaches into the interior of the tree during harvest. Its shell is easier to open than that of most commercial varieties.\n[[Image:Macadamia Maroochy.JPG|right|thumb|Macadamia 'Maroochy' new growth]]\n\n===Maroochy===\nA pure ''M. tetraphylla'' variety from Australia, this strain is cultivated for its productive crop yield, flavor, and suitability for pollinating 'Beaumont'.\n\n===Nelmac II===\nA South African ''M. integrifolia'' / ''M. tetraphylla'' hybrid cultivar, it has a sweet seed, which means it has to be cooked carefully so that the sugars do not caramelise. The sweet seed is usually not fully processed, as it generally does not taste as good, but many people enjoy eating it uncooked. It has an open micropyle (hole in the shell) which may let in mould. The crack-out percentage (ratio of nut meat to whole nut, by weight) is high. Ten-year-old trees average  {{convert|22|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} per tree. It is a popular variety because of its pollination of 'Beaumont', and the yields are almost comparable.\n\n===Renown===\nA ''M. integrifolia'' / ''M. tetraphylla'' hybrid, this is a rather spreading tree. On the plus side, it is high yielding commercially, {{convert|17|kg|abbr=on}} from a 9-year-old tree has been recorded, and the nuts drop to the ground. However, they are thick-shelled, with not much flavor.\n\n{{nutritionalvalue \n| name=Macadamia nuts, raw \n| kJ=3080 \n| fat=75.8 g \n| satfat=12 g\n| monofat=59 g\n| polyfat=1.5 g\n| protein=7.9 g\n| carbs=13.8 g \n| fiber=8.6 g\n| sugars=4.57 g \n| iron_mg=3.69 \n| calcium_mg=85 \n| magnesium_mg=130 \n| phosphorus_mg=188 \n| potassium_mg=368\n| manganese_mg=4.1\n| zinc_mg=1.30 \n| vitC_mg=1.2  \n| vitE_mg=0.54  \n| thiamin_mg=1.195 \n| riboflavin_mg=0.162 \n| niacin_mg=2.473\n| pantothenic_mg=0.76 \n| vitB6_mg=0.275\n| folate_ug=11\n| right=0 \n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3673?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=35&sort=&qlookup=Nuts%2C+macadamia&offset=&format=Full&new=&measureby= Full Link to USDA Database entry] \n}}\n==Production==\n\nIn 2018, [[South Africa]] was estimated to remain the world's leading producer of macadamia nuts with 54,000 tonnes out of global production of 211,000 tonnes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.agriorbit.com/more-and-more-macadamia-produced-globally-world-nut-conference/|title=More and more macadamia produced globally|last=Motaung|first=Ntswaki|date=2018-05-30|website=Agriorbit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> In 2015, South Africa produced {{convert|48,000|t|ST}} compared to Australia's 40,000 tonnes and the total global production of {{convert|160,000|t|ST}}.<ref name=\"fp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/137977/South-Africa-becomes-king-of-macadamia-nuts-again | title=South Africa becomes king of macadamia nuts again | publisher=FreshPlaza | date=14 April 2015 | accessdate=9 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010043705/http://www.freshplaza.com/article/137977/South-Africa-becomes-king-of-macadamia-nuts-again | archive-date=10 October 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Macadamia is also commercially produced in [[Brazil]], [[United States]] ([[California]] and [[Hawaii]] states), [[Costa Rica]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], [[China]], [[Bolivia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Malawi]].\n\nThe first commercial orchard of macadamia trees was planted in the early 1880s by Rous Mill, {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Lismore, New South Wales]], consisting of ''M. tetraphylla''.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Macadamia Power Pty | year=1982 | title=Macadamia Power in a Nutshell | publisher=Macadamia Power Pty Limited | page=13 | isbn=978-0-9592892-0-6}}</ref> Besides the development of a small boutique industry in Australia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, macadamia was extensively planted as a commercial crop in [[Hawaii]] from the 1920s.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s Mann played duets at New York City's [[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]] and [[Village Gate]] clubs, with [[Sarod]] virtuoso [[Vasant Rai]].\n\nFollowing the 1969 hit album ''[[Memphis Underground]]'', a number of [[smooth jazz]] records influenced by [[Southern soul]], [[blues rock]], [[reggae]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] elicited criticism from jazz purists but allowed Mann to remain active during a period of declining interest in jazz. The musicians on these recordings are some of the best-known session players in soul and jazz, including singer [[Cissy Houston]] (mother of [[Whitney Houston]]), guitarists [[Duane Allman]] and [[Larry Coryell]], bassists [[Donald \"Duck\" Dunn]], [[Chuck Rainey]], and [[Miroslav Vitous]], and drummers [[Al Jackson, Jr.]] and [[Bernard Purdie]]. In this period Mann had a number of [[pop music|pop]] hits \u2014 rare for a jazz musician. According to a 1998 interview Mann had made at least 25 albums that were on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] pop charts, success denied most of his jazz peers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimnewsom.com/hm-articles.html |title=Herbie Mann Articles |publisher=Jimnewsom.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref>\n\nMann provided the music for the 1978 [[National Film Board of Canada]] [[animated short]]'' [[Afterlife]]'', by [[Ishu Patel]].\n\n[[File:Herbie Mann.jpg|thumb|Herbie Mann and [[Will Lee (bassist)|Will Lee]] (1975)]]\nIn the early 1970s he founded his own label, [[Embryo Records]], distributed by [[Cotillion Records]], a division of [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/embryo.html |title=Embryo Album Discography |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |date=2005-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}</ref> Embryo produced jazz albums, such as [[Ron Carter]]'s ''Uptown Conversation'' (1970); [[Miroslav Vitous]]' first solo album, ''Infinite Search'' (1969); [[Phil Woods]] and his European Rhythm Machine at the Frankfurt Jazz Festival (1971); and [[Dick Morrissey]] and [[Jim Mullen]]'s ''[[Up (Morrissey\u2013Mullen album)|Up]]'' (1976), which featured the [[Average White Band]] as a rhythm section; and the 730 Series, with a more rock-oriented style, including ''Zero Time'' (1971) by [[TONTO's Expanding Head Band]]. He later set up [[Kokopelli Records]] after difficulty with established labels. In 1996, Mann collaborated with [[Stereolab]] on the song \"One Note Samba/Surfboard\" for the AIDS-Benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

Mann championed Brazilian music even before [[Stan Getz]]. When Miles was fusing jazz with rock, Mann was fusing it with Memphis soul and [[Southern rock]].

Ownership of several villages on both sides of the [[de facto]] border were disputed and claimed by both countries. The dispute over the demarcation of the Indo-Bangladeshi border worsened due to the existence of over [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|190 enclaves]].\n\nOne of the disputed areas was a small sliver of land near the village of Padua/Pyrdiwah, on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]],<ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] was used by Indian security forces to train the Bangladeshi [[Mukti Bahini]], who were fighting the [[Pakistani Army]].

It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within. However both sides held their fire and began negotiations. The Bangladeshi soldiers claimed, the village had been illegally occupied by India since Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.<ref name=\"Analysis\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1285576.stm Analysis: Surprising outbreak of hostilities], ''BBC''</ref><ref name=\"Tension\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1283703.stm Tension along the border], ''BBC''</ref> The Bangladeshi soldiers stated that they were acting on orders from their government and insisted that the BSF personnel vacate the village. The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers.

in the third week of April 2001 between troops of the [[Bangladesh Rifles]] (BDR) and the Indian [[Border Security Force]] (BSF) on the <nowiki/>poorly marked [[international border]] between the two countries.\n\n== Cause ==\nThe [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal in 1947]] left a poorly demarcated international border between India and Bangladesh (then-[[East Pakistan]]). Ownership of several villages on both sides of the [[de facto]] border were disputed and claimed by both countries. The dispute over the demarcation of the Indo-Bangladeshi border worsened due to the existence of over [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves|190 enclaves]].\n\nOne of the disputed areas was a small sliver of land near the village of Padua/Pyrdiwah, on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]],<ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] was used by Indian security forces to train the Bangladeshi [[Mukti Bahini]], who were fighting the [[Pakistani Army]].

It took place around the village of Pyrdiwah (also known as Padua), in the Indian state of Meghalaya <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> which adjoins the Tamabil area of the Bangladesh border in the Sylhet district. In that area, 6.5 kilometres of the border had remained in dispute for the past 30 years, but a [[Status quo]] had been maintained for that period.<ref name=\"Analysis\" />\n\nOn April 15, 2001, <ref name=\"Analysis\" /> approximately 1000 Bangladeshi soldiers <ref name=\"withdrawls\" /> attacked and captured Pyrdiwah village, breaking the [[Status quo]] and forced Indian civilians there to flee.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"fline\" /> The Indian BSF post in Pyrdiwah village was surrounded, trapping 31 BSF personnel within. However both sides held their fire and began negotiations. The Bangladeshi soldiers claimed, the village had been illegally occupied by India since Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971.<ref name=\"Analysis\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1285576.stm Analysis: Surprising outbreak of hostilities], ''BBC''</ref><ref name=\"Tension\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1283703.stm Tension along the border], ''BBC''</ref> The Bangladeshi soldiers stated that they were acting on orders from their government and insisted that the BSF personnel vacate the village. The next day, on April 17, Director-General of the Bangladesh Rifles, Fazlur Rahman gave details of the Pyrdiwah thrust and stated \"We have just completed a mission to restore our territory and sovereignty.\" This incident was resolved later without any bloodshed.<ref name=\"itoday\" />\n\nImmediately after the incident at Pyrdiwah, BSF troops along the Bangladesh border were put on alert and intensified border patrolling.<ref name=\"itoday\" /> A few days later, a contingent of BSF troops entered Bangladeshi territory at the village of Boroibari, more than 200&nbsp;km to the west of Padua. Unlike Pyrdiwah, which was an adverse possession - a village inhabited by Indians but one that actually belonged to Bangladesh (pending ratification of the border agreement) - Boraibari bordering Assam lay across a fence. Also, unlike Pyrdiwah, which was neither fenced nor had any pillars to clearly demarcate it, Boraibari was a large village with a population of at least 1,000. Its population had also largely been hostile to India, according to Indian security officials, over incidents of cross border violations by the villagers.\n\nThe intrusion was intended to serve as retaliation for the incident of Padua.<ref name=\"frl\" /><ref name=\"itoday\" /> According to Bangladesh sources, Indian forces launched an early morning attack on their posts in the frontier district of Kurigram \u2013 which lies on the border with Indian state of Assam.<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> \n\nImmediately upon entering Bangladeshi territory the Indian paramilitary personnel were ambushed and disarmed by Bangladeshi soldiers assisted by hundreds of villagers.

Ultraviolet released a single and an [[Extended Play|EP]] on [[Sanctuary Records Group]] and disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\nDrew: ''\" When we did Ultraviolet it was basically Feline under a different name because we got dropped by the record company and we wanted to do another deal. Then we realised that ploy, that cynical ploy was not going to pay off and we thought, right we want to do the music that we want to do now and that meant kicking out the other guitar player who wasn't really into that sort of music, and making a deliberate decision not to sort of kiss up to anyone in the business anymore and to start doing everything for ourselves. \"'' <ref>http://www.festivalphoto.net/reviews&review=966</ref>\n\n===''Operation Hypocrite'' EP, ''Spawn Of Dysfunction'' (2000-2004)===\nDie So Fluid first surfaced in 2000, touring the [[United Kingdom]] after the release of their debut [[Operation Hypocrite EP]], on Raw Power, an imprint of\n[[Sanctuary Records Group|Sanctuary]]. Die So Fluid released one single on [[Sanctuary Records Group|Sanctuary]] following the EP before forming their own\nlabel, Cartesian. Once Cartesian was established, Die So Fluid released one single before releasing their debut album, ''[[Spawn of Dysfunction]]'', the following\nyear. The recording of the album was financed by Grog's session work as live bassist for [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Melanie C]] and [[Kelly Osbourne]]. Whilst Grog was away on tour 'fund-raising' Al Fletcher performed drums on various recording sessions including [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]]'s [[Jamaican E.T.]] which won the 2003 Grammy Award for 'Best Reggae Album'. Drew Richards spent this time writing and producing the original score for the documentary feature film [[The Mindscape of Alan Moore]]. ''[[Spawn of Dysfunction]]'' was universally well received and is still selling through the major chains of the UK and [[iTunes]] worldwide. After the album was released,\nthe band went on an intense touring schedule, supporting bands such as [[Drowning Pool]], [[Vex Red]], [[Clawfinger]], [[Boy Hits Car]], [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]],\n[[Girlschool]], AntiProduct, & [[The Wildhearts]].<ref>{{cite web|author=shelley hannan |url=http://www.diesofluid.net/biography.html |title=Official &#124; Biog |publisher=Die So Fluid |accessdate=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045733/http://www.diesofluid.net/biography.html |archivedate=7 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015, [[Strata Books]] published a memoir by Grog Rox and Drew Richards as part of its Debut Series about the making of [[Spawn of Dysfunction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratabooks.co.uk/debut/debut-spawn-of-dysfunction-die-so-fluid/ |title=Debut:\u2018Spawn of Dysfunction\u2019 \u2013 Die So Fluid |publisher=stratabooks.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref>\n\n===''Not Everybody Gets A Happy Ending'' (2005-2009)===\nThe recording sessions for their second album, ''[[Not Everybody Gets a Happy Ending]]'', started in 2005, but were not finished until 2007 due to financial restrictions. The title was taken from the notion that the album may never be completed. At the 13th hour investment from a private individual made finishing the record possible. The band decided to release the album on Parole Records, based in Finland, keeping the release independent. Two digital singles were released from 2007 - 2008 in support of the album ''Happy Halloween'' and ''Existential Baby''. When the album was released in February 2008, it immediately entered the retail sales charts. Known for their diligent touring, Die So Fluid engaged in another massive tour, appearing in nearly 20 different countries in 2009. Apart from headlining some festivals, Die So Fluid toured with bands like [[Eisbrecher]], [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], [[My Ruin]], [[Ill Ni\u00f1o]], [[Maj Karma]], & [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=87651 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - MY RUIN Parts Ways With Drummer, Announces Replacement |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |accessdate=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606100519/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=87651 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===''The World Is Too Big For One Lifetime'' (2010-2011)===\n''[[The World Is Too Big for One Lifetime]]'' was released in June 2010 on the Global Music DR2 label. As with previous releases it received very strong reviews from the alternative press whilst mostly slipping under the radar of the mainstream media. The album has kept a steady presence in specialist sales charts, such as Amazon's alternative metal chart, and in a diverse selection of territories thanks mainly to consistent touring, word of mouth and support from the alternative press and webzines. They have also proven themselves to be very adept at crossing over to quite different music audiences whether it be the goths of the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] or the classic rock fans of [[Hard Rock Hell]] or the indie pop fans when supporting [[Mindless Self Indulgence]]. Two singles were drawn from ''[[The World Is Too Big for One Lifetime]]'' - ''Mercury'' and ''What a heart is for''. The singles were available for download only and accompanied by videos shot by director David Kenny.\n\n===''The Opposites Of Light'' (2012-2016)===\n''The Opposites Of Light'' was released on 5 May 2014. The release of the album is staggered to coincide with tours in various territories.  Writing and pre-production was completed in early 2012 and recording started in earnest in December 2012. Drums, Bass and Strings were recorded at Unit 2, West London, Guitars recorded at Drew's studio in North London and Vocals were recorded by Grog at home in Los Angeles. Initially scheduled to be a double album 18 songs were recorded but this was reduced to 16 tracks for the final cut. Still described as an album of two halves tracks 1-8 are grouped under the name 'Shakura\u2019 and tracks 9-16 are\u2018Pah\u2019. These are the Solar and Lunar deities of the matriarchal Pawnee Native Americans. Shakura encompasses the hard rock sounds traditionally associated with Die So Fluid whilst Pah delves into more demure, slower tempo songs. This is the first album entirely produced by the band. Mixing was divided between Mark Williams and Drew Richards and also one track being mixed by [[Sylvia Massy]] and Ian Rickard. On 6 November a video for the first track to be released from this album, entitled '[http://wickergirl.com/2013/04/26/die-so-fluid-music-video-shoot/ Black Blizzard]' was released on YouTube. In April a second video off the album for 'Comets' was released. In August, the video for 'Landslides' was uploaded to YouTube. The video for the opening track to The Opposites of Light, 'Nightmares' was released in early November. In January 2015 the band embarked on a long overdue tour of the USA in support of [[Wednesday 13]] and followed it up with a shorter west coast tour in support of [[The Dreaming (US band)|The Dreaming]]. A more extensive June tour with The Dreaming had to be shelved due to budget constraints. The band returned home and began writing songs for their fifth album. In October 2015 an announcement was made via the band's website of the retirement of their long-time manager George Jackson and the appointment of their new manager Gordon Biggins at [[Strata Music]].\n\nOn 25 July 2016, drummer Al Fletcher died from \"[[double pneumonia]] followed by [[sepsis]] in a rare reaction to an infection\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DieSoFluid/photos/a.423079011380.189000.11472901380/10153772811411381/?type=3 |title=Die So Fluid official facebook page |publisher=facebook.com |date=2016-07-26 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moshville.co.uk/news/2016/07/r-i-p-al-fletcher-die-so-fluid/ |title=R.I.P.

Ultraviolet released a single and an [[Extended Play|EP]] on [[Sanctuary Records Group]] and disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\nDrew: ''\" When we did Ultraviolet it was basically Feline under a different name because we got dropped by the record company and we wanted to do another deal. Then we realised that ploy, that cynical ploy was not going to pay off and we thought, right we want to do the music that we want to do now and that meant kicking out the other guitar player who wasn't really into that sort of music, and making a deliberate decision not to sort of kiss up to anyone in the business anymore and to start doing everything for ourselves. \"'' <ref>http://www.festivalphoto.net/reviews&review=966</ref>\n\n===''Operation Hypocrite'' EP, ''Spawn Of Dysfunction'' (2000-2004)===\nDie So Fluid first surfaced in 2000, touring the [[United Kingdom]] after the release of their debut [[Operation Hypocrite EP]], on Raw Power, an imprint of\n[[Sanctuary Records Group|Sanctuary]]. Die So Fluid released one single on [[Sanctuary Records Group|Sanctuary]] following the EP before forming their own\nlabel, Cartesian. Once Cartesian was established, Die So Fluid released one single before releasing their debut album, ''[[Spawn of Dysfunction]]'', the following\nyear. The recording of the album was financed by Grog's session work as live bassist for [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Melanie C]] and [[Kelly Osbourne]]. Whilst Grog was away on tour 'fund-raising' Al Fletcher performed drums on various recording sessions including [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]]'s [[Jamaican E.T.]] which won the 2003 Grammy Award for 'Best Reggae Album'. Drew Richards spent this time writing and producing the original score for the documentary feature film [[The Mindscape of Alan Moore]]. ''[[Spawn of Dysfunction]]'' was universally well received and is still selling through the major chains of the UK and [[iTunes]] worldwide. After the album was released,\nthe band went on an intense touring schedule, supporting bands such as [[Drowning Pool]], [[Vex Red]], [[Clawfinger]], [[Boy Hits Car]], [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]],\n[[Girlschool]], AntiProduct, & [[The Wildhearts]].<ref>{{cite web|author=shelley hannan |url=http://www.diesofluid.net/biography.html |title=Official &#124; Biog |publisher=Die So Fluid |accessdate=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045733/http://www.diesofluid.net/biography.html |archivedate=7 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015, [[Strata Books]] published a memoir by Grog Rox and Drew Richards as part of its Debut Series about the making of [[Spawn of Dysfunction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratabooks.co.uk/debut/debut-spawn-of-dysfunction-die-so-fluid/ |title=Debut:\u2018Spawn of Dysfunction\u2019 \u2013 Die So Fluid |publisher=stratabooks.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref>\n\n===''Not Everybody Gets A Happy Ending'' (2005-2009)===\nThe recording sessions for their second album, ''[[Not Everybody Gets a Happy Ending]]'', started in 2005, but were not finished until 2007 due to financial restrictions. The title was taken from the notion that the album may never be completed. At the 13th hour investment from a private individual made finishing the record possible. The band decided to release the album on Parole Records, based in Finland, keeping the release independent. Two digital singles were released from 2007 - 2008 in support of the album ''Happy Halloween'' and ''Existential Baby''. When the album was released in February 2008, it immediately entered the retail sales charts. Known for their diligent touring, Die So Fluid engaged in another massive tour, appearing in nearly 20 different countries in 2009. Apart from headlining some festivals, Die So Fluid toured with bands like [[Eisbrecher]], [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], [[My Ruin]], [[Ill Ni\u00f1o]], [[Maj Karma]], & [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=87651 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - MY RUIN Parts Ways With Drummer, Announces Replacement |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |accessdate=2010-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606100519/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=87651 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===''The World Is Too Big For One Lifetime'' (2010-2011)===\n''[[The World Is Too Big for One Lifetime]]'' was released in June 2010 on the Global Music DR2 label. As with previous releases it received very strong reviews from the alternative press whilst mostly slipping under the radar of the mainstream media. The album has kept a steady presence in specialist sales charts, such as Amazon's alternative metal chart, and in a diverse selection of territories thanks mainly to consistent touring, word of mouth and support from the alternative press and webzines. They have also proven themselves to be very adept at crossing over to quite different music audiences whether it be the goths of the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] or the classic rock fans of [[Hard Rock Hell]] or the indie pop fans when supporting [[Mindless Self Indulgence]]. Two singles were drawn from ''[[The World Is Too Big for One Lifetime]]'' - ''Mercury'' and ''What a heart is for''. The singles were available for download only and accompanied by videos shot by director David Kenny.\n\n===''The Opposites Of Light'' (2012-2016)===\n''The Opposites Of Light'' was released on 5 May 2014. The release of the album is staggered to coincide with tours in various territories.  Writing and pre-production was completed in early 2012 and recording started in earnest in December 2012. Drums, Bass and Strings were recorded at Unit 2, West London, Guitars recorded at Drew's studio in North London and Vocals were recorded by Grog at home in Los Angeles. Initially scheduled to be a double album 18 songs were recorded but this was reduced to 16 tracks for the final cut. Still described as an album of two halves tracks 1-8 are grouped under the name 'Shakura\u2019 and tracks 9-16 are\u2018Pah\u2019. These are the Solar and Lunar deities of the matriarchal Pawnee Native Americans. Shakura encompasses the hard rock sounds traditionally associated with Die So Fluid whilst Pah delves into more demure, slower tempo songs. This is the first album entirely produced by the band. Mixing was divided between Mark Williams and Drew Richards and also one track being mixed by [[Sylvia Massy]] and Ian Rickard. On 6 November a video for the first track to be released from this album, entitled '[http://wickergirl.com/2013/04/26/die-so-fluid-music-video-shoot/ Black Blizzard]' was released on YouTube. In April a second video off the album for 'Comets' was released. In August, the video for 'Landslides' was uploaded to YouTube. The video for the opening track to The Opposites of Light, 'Nightmares' was released in early November. In January 2015 the band embarked on a long overdue tour of the USA in support of [[Wednesday 13]] and followed it up with a shorter west coast tour in support of [[The Dreaming (US band)|The Dreaming]]. A more extensive June tour with The Dreaming had to be shelved due to budget constraints. The band returned home and began writing songs for their fifth album. In October 2015 an announcement was made via the band's website of the retirement of their long-time manager George Jackson and the appointment of their new manager Gordon Biggins at [[Strata Music]].\n\nOn 25 July 2016, drummer Al Fletcher died from \"[[double pneumonia]] followed by [[sepsis]] in a rare reaction to an infection\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DieSoFluid/photos/a.423079011380.189000.11472901380/10153772811411381/?type=3 |title=Die So Fluid official facebook page |publisher=facebook.com |date=2016-07-26 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moshville.co.uk/news/2016/07/r-i-p-al-fletcher-die-so-fluid/ |title=R.I.P.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|Lowell Green]]\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], USA\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show'' (also known as ''The Island of Sanity'')\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].
