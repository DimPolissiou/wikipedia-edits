Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} network of high-tech fencing, concrete walls and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. 'The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,' said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces.

Eventually, it will encircle the town, but already, there is only one gate in and out of Qalquilya. Moving to and from the town is a draining process of waiting in the sunshine while papers are taken away and thought about. You can't take a car from one side to the other. When you finally get through, you have to trudge through a no-man's-land to pick up a bus or taxi. ... Until the start of the current round of violence (the second intifada, in September 2000), 85,000 Israelis and Palestinians used to pour into Qalquilya every week to visit the shops and markets. Goods were cheaper than in Israel. No one comes any more, partly out of fear, partly because it's so hard to get in or out. And now the barrier threatens to cut the town off from 80 per cent of its agricultural land and 19 of its wells.\u2026Before the construction started, half of Qalquilya's income came from agriculture. Now, 4,000 people \u2013 10 per cent of the population \u2013 have left. An additional 2,200 heads of household have gone to find work elsewhere, leaving their families behind. ... Unemployment is now 69 per cent. With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes about 3.5 m shekels (\u00a3490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply. ... The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: 'In 10 years, there will be no room to expand. Forced off the land, Palestinians will be clustered into already heavily populated urban areas; with no alternative sources of income, they will be a source of cheap labour for Israeli factories.'}}</ref> The [[International Court of Justice]] issued an advisory opinion stating that the barrier is a violation of international law.<ref>\"[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=11292 International Court of Justice finds Israeli barrier in Palestinian territory is illegal]\".

One 8 meter-high concrete section of this wall follows the Green Line between the city and the nearby Trans-Israel Highway.

In the same ruling, the court rejected the arguments that the fence must be built only on the Green Line. The ruling cited the topography of the terrain, security considerations, and sections 43 and 52 of The Hague Regulations 1907 and Article 53 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] as reasons for this rejection.<ref name = \"HCF\"/>\n\n[[File:Palestinian children and Israeli wall.jpg|thumb|Palestinian children running towards the barrier, August 2004]]\nIn early October 2003, the IDF OC [[Israeli Central Command|Central Command]] declared the area between the separation barrier in the northern section of the West Bank (Stage 1) and the Green Line a closed military area for an indefinite period.

''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' reports that, for some Palestinians who are Israeli citizens living in the [[Israeli Arab]] town of [[Umm el-Fahm]] (population 42,000) near Jenin, the barrier has \"significantly improved their lives\" because, on one hand, it prevents would-be thieves or terrorists from coming to their town and, on the other hand, has increased the flow of customers from other parts of Israel who would normally have patronised Palestinian business in the West Bank, resulting in an economic boom.

The ICJ said that an occupying power cannot claim that the lawful inhabitants of the occupied territory constitute a \"foreign\" threat for the purposes of Article 51 of the UN Charter. It also explained that necessity may constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under certain very limited circumstances, but that Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) bars a defense of necessity if the State has contributed to the situation of necessity. The Court cited illegal interference by the government of Israel with the Palestinian's national right to self-determination; and land confiscations, house demolitions, the creation of enclaves, and restrictions on movement and access to water, food, education, health care, work, and an adequate standard of living in violation of Israel's obligations under international law.

A street artist from New York, Swoon, put two works on the Sentry towers in Bethlehem. She did not anticipate that some Palestinians would be opposed to her efforts. Swoon states that there was much enthusiasm from the kids of the Aida refugee camp, who were excited about the new artwork going on the wall. While the kids were excited, many elders believed that the children would grow up with the wrong, positive idea of the wall. One elder from the refugee camp claimed that \"they don't necessarily want the kids to start viewing that area positively, and so they see the work as a thing of beauty, but in a place where beauty shouldn't be\" (Parry, 10). Most international artists felt that they were creating \"something for the people trapped behind wall, as well as creating an international symbol that would be broadcast around the world. [The elder man] wasn't speaking about international symbols, but about what it means to live in the shadow of an 80 foot guard tower\" (Parry, 10). Although the graffiti artists felt that they were making a statement with their pieces that would help bring attention and help to the Palestinians, many Palestinians feel that it turns the wall into something beautiful. By painting on the wall, some Palestinians feel that the wall turns into a work of art instead \"of an aggressive prison Wall\" (Parry, 10). Of course, transforming the wall into something positive was not the intention of the artists. They thought that their work would bring out the oppressiveness and the emotion responses of the people affected by the wall.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parry|first=William|title=Against the Wall the Art of Resistance in Palestine|publisher=Lawrence Hill|location=Chicago|page=192}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fnyulibrary-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D716232|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 2006, when he visited Israel to give a concert, [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Roger Waters]] wrote \"Tear down the wall\" on the wall, a phrase from the Pink Floyd album ''[[The Wall]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/pink-floyd-s-roger-waters-urges-israel-to-tear-down-the-wall-1.190942|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters urges Israel to 'tear down the wall'.

Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} network of high-tech fencing, concrete walls and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank.

Eventually, it will encircle the town, but already, there is only one gate in and out of Qalquilya. Moving to and from the town is a draining process of waiting in the sunshine while papers are taken away and thought about. You can't take a car from one side to the other. When you finally get through, you have to trudge through a no-man's-land to pick up a bus or taxi. ... Until the start of the current round of violence (the second intifada, in September 2000), 85,000 Israelis and Palestinians used to pour into Qalquilya every week to visit the shops and markets. Goods were cheaper than in Israel. No one comes any more, partly out of fear, partly because it's so hard to get in or out. And now the barrier threatens to cut the town off from 80 per cent of its agricultural land and 19 of its wells.\u2026Before the construction started, half of Qalquilya's income came from agriculture. Now, 4,000 people \u2013 10 per cent of the population \u2013 have left. An additional 2,200 heads of household have gone to find work elsewhere, leaving their families behind. ... Unemployment is now 69 per cent. With its bottleneck entrance so often corked, the town is coming close to economic strangulation. More than 600 businesses have closed and many residents have been unable to pay their municipal taxes, with the result that the Qalquilya municipality owes about 3.5 m shekels (\u00a3490,000) to the Israeli Electric Company, which is threatening to cut off the city's supply. ... The story of overcrowding and economic peril will be repeated in other Palestinian cities, according to Jamal Juma, co-ordinator of the Palestinian Environmental Network: 'In 10 years, there will be no room to expand. Forced off the land, Palestinians will be clustered into already heavily populated urban areas; with no alternative sources of income, they will be a source of cheap labour for Israeli factories.'}}</ref> The [[International Court of Justice]] issued an advisory opinion stating that the barrier is a violation of international law.<ref>\"[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=11292 International Court of Justice finds Israeli barrier in Palestinian territory is illegal]\".

A street artist from New York, Swoon, put two works on the Sentry towers in Bethlehem. She did not anticipate that some Palestinians would be opposed to her efforts. Swoon states that there was much enthusiasm from the kids of the Aida refugee camp, who were excited about the new artwork going on the wall. While the kids were excited, many elders believed that the children would grow up with the wrong, positive idea of the wall. One elder from the refugee camp claimed that \"they don't necessarily want the kids to start viewing that area positively, and so they see the work as a thing of beauty, but in a place where beauty shouldn't be\" (Parry, 10). Most international artists felt that they were creating \"something for the people trapped behind wall, as well as creating an international symbol that would be broadcast around the world. [The elder man] wasn't speaking about international symbols, but about what it means to live in the shadow of an 80 foot guard tower\" (Parry, 10). Although the graffiti artists felt that they were making a statement with their pieces that would help bring attention and help to the Palestinians, many Palestinians feel that it turns the wall into something beautiful. By painting on the wall, some Palestinians feel that the wall turns into a work of art instead \"of an aggressive prison Wall\" (Parry, 10). Of course, transforming the wall into something positive was not the intention of the artists. They thought that their work would bring out the oppressiveness and the emotion responses of the people affected by the wall.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parry|first=William|title=Against the Wall the Art of Resistance in Palestine|publisher=Lawrence Hill|location=Chicago|page=192}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fnyulibrary-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D716232|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 2006, when he visited Israel to give a concert, [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Roger Waters]] wrote \"Tear down the wall\" on the wall, a phrase from the Pink Floyd album ''[[The Wall]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/pink-floyd-s-roger-waters-urges-israel-to-tear-down-the-wall-1.190942|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters urges Israel to 'tear down the wall'.

Like the Qizilbash, the latter were an early Shi'i ''ghulat'' group<ref name=\"S-G\" /> and dressed in red, for which they were termed \"the red ones\" ({{lang-fa|\u0633\u0631\u062e\u200c\u062c\u0627\u0645\u06af\u0627\u0646}},{{lang-ar|\u0645\u062d\u0645\u0631\u0629}} ''[[mu\u1e25ammirah]]'') by medieval sources.<ref>H.

As a consequence, any act of disobedience of the Qizilbash Sufis against the order of the spiritual grandmaster (Persian: ''n\u0101sufigari'' \"conduct unbecoming of a Sufi\") became \"an act of treason against the king and a crime against the state\", as was the case in 1614 when Padishah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas the Great]] put some followers to death.<ref>Roger M. Savory, \"The office of ''khalifat al-khulafa'' under the Safawids\", in JOAS, lxxxv, 1965, p. 501</ref>\n\n==Beliefs==\n{{Shia Islam|Branches}}\nThe Qizilbash adhered to [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] Shi\u2019i doctrines encouraged by the early Safavi sheikhs Haydar and his son [[Ismail I]]. They regarded their rulers as divine figures, and so were classified as ''[[ghulat]]'' \"extremists\" by orthodox [[Twelver]]s.<ref>Momen, 1985</ref>\n\nWhen [[Tabriz]] was taken, there was not a single book on Twelverism among the Qizilbash leaders. The book of the well known Iraqi scholar [[al-Hilli]] (1250\u20131325) was procured in the town library to provide religious guidance to the state.<ref>Moojan Momen, \"An Introduction to Shi'i Islam\", Yale Univ. Press, 1985, ''{{ISBN|0-300-03499-7}}'', p. 397</ref> The imported Shi'i ''[[ulama]]'' did not participate in the formation of Safavid religious policies during the early formation of the state. However, ''ghulat'' doctrines were later forsaken and Arab Twelver ''ulama'' from [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], and [[Bahrain]] were imported in increasing numbers to bolster orthodox Twelver practice and belief.\n\n=== Qizilbash aqidah in Anatolia ===\n{{main|Qalandariyya|Imadaddin Nasimi|Hurufism|Bektashism and folk religion}}\n{{further|Mansur Al-Hallaj|Sevener|Qarmatians|Baba Ishak|Babai revolt|Hassan II of Alamut |Muhammad II of Alamut}}\nIn Turkey, orthoprax Twelvers following [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] are called Ja'faris. Although the Qizilbash are also Twelvers, their practices do not adhere to Ja'fari jurisprudence.\n* The Qizilbash have a unique and complex conviction tracing back to the [[Kaysanites]] and Khurramites, who are considered [[ghulat]] Shia. According to Turkish scholar Abd\u00fclbaki G\u00f6lpinarli, the Qizilbash of the 16th century \u2013 a religious and political movement in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] that helped to establish the Safavid dynasty \u2013 were \"spiritual descendants of the Khurramites\".<ref>Roger M.

The ''khal\u012bfa'', in turn, had subordinates termed ''pira''. The Safavi presence in eastern Anatolia posed a serious threat to the [[Ottoman Empire]] because they encouraged the Shi'i population of Asia Minor to revolt against the sultan.\n\nIn 1499, Ismail, the young leader of the Safavi order, left Lahijan for Ardabil to make a bid for power. By the summer of 1500, about 7,000 supporters from the local Turcoman tribes of [[Asia Minor]] (Anatolia), [[Syria]], and the [[Caucasus]] \u2013 collectively called \"Qizilbash\" by their enemies \u2013 rallied to his support in [[Erzincan]].<ref>Faruk S\u00fcmer, ''Safevi Devletinin Kurulu\u015fu ve Geli\u015fmesinde Anadolu T\u00fcrklerinin Rol\u00fc'', T\u00fcrk Tarih Kurumu Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, Ankara, 1992, p. 15. {{in lang|tr}}</ref> Leading his troops on a punitive campaign against the Sh\u012brvansh\u0101h (ruler of [[Shirvan]]), he sought revenge for the death of his father and his grandfather in Sh\u012brvan.

In order to stop the Safavid propaganda, [[Bayezid II|Sultan Bayezid II]] deported large numbers of the Shi'i population of [[Asia Minor]] to [[Morea]]. However, in 1507, Shah Ismail and the Qizilbash overran large areas of Kurdistan, defeating regional Ottoman forces.

Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and several other specific posts of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society with these Caucasian elements and who would question the power and hegemony of the tribal Qizilbash. This included the formation of a military slave system,<ref name=\"Streusand, p. 148\">Streusand, p. 148.</ref> similar to that of the neighboring [[Ottoman Empire]] \u2013 the [[janissaries]].<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barda-v|title=Barda and Barda-D\u0101ri v.

This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the [[Qajar Dynasty]].\n\nInter-tribal rivalry of the Turcomans, the attempt of Persian nobles to end the Turcoman dominance, and constant succession conflicts went on for another 10 years after Tahmasp's death. This heavily weakened the Safavid state and made the kingdom vulnerable to external enemies: the Ottomans [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|attacked]] in the west, whereas the Uzbeks attacked the east.\n[[Image:Daud Khan Undiladze.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daud Khan Undiladze]], Safavid ''ghulam'', military commander, and the governor of [[Karabakh]] and [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] between 1627 and 1633.]]\nIn 1588, [[Shah Abbas I]] came to power.

Later on, events of the past, including the role of the Turcomans in the succession struggles after the death of his father, and the counterbalancing influence of traditional [[Shia|Ithn\u0101\u02bbashari Shia]] [[Sayed]]s, made him determined to end the dominance of the untrustworthy Turcoman chiefs in Persia which Tahmasp had already started decades before him. In order to weaken the Turcomans \u2013 the important militant elite of the Safavid kingdom \u2013 Shah Abbas further raised a standing army, personal guard, Queen-Mothers, [[Harems]] and full civil administration from the ranks of these ''ghilman'' who were usually ethnic [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], and [[Armenians]], both men and women, whom he and his predeseccors had taken captive en masse during their wars in the Caucasus, and would systematically replace the Qizilbash from their functions with converted [[Circassians]] and [[Georgians]]. The new army and civil administration would be fully loyal to the king personally and not to the clan-chiefs anymore.<ref name=\"EoI\" />\n\nThe reorganisation of the army also ended the independent rule of Turcoman chiefs in the Safavid provinces, and instead centralized the administration of those provinces.\n\n''Ghulams'' were appointed to high positions within the royal household, and by the end of Shah Abbas' reign, one-fifth of the high-ranking [[amir]]s were ghulams.<ref name=\"Minorsky\" /> By 1598 already an ethnic [[Georgians|Georgian]] from Safavid-ruled Georgia, well known by his adopted Muslim name after conversion, [[Allahverdi Khan]], had risen to the position of commander-in-chief of all Safavid armed forces.<ref>C.

Like the Qizilbash, the latter were an early Shi'i ''ghulat'' group<ref name=\"S-G\" /> and dressed in red, for which they were termed \"the red ones\" ({{lang-fa|\u0633\u0631\u062e\u200c\u062c\u0627\u0645\u06af\u0627\u0646}},{{lang-ar|\u0645\u062d\u0645\u0631\u0629}} ''[[mu\u1e25ammirah]]'') by medieval sources.<ref>H.

As a consequence, any act of disobedience of the Qizilbash Sufis against the order of the spiritual grandmaster (Persian: ''n\u0101sufigari'' \"conduct unbecoming of a Sufi\") became \"an act of treason against the king and a crime against the state\", as was the case in 1614 when Padishah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas the Great]] put some followers to death.<ref>Roger M.

They regarded their rulers as divine figures, and so were classified as ''[[ghulat]]'' \"extremists\" by orthodox [[Twelver]]s.<ref>Momen, 1985</ref>\n\nWhen [[Tabriz]] was taken, there was not a single book on Twelverism among the Qizilbash leaders. The book of the well known Iraqi scholar [[al-Hilli]] (1250\u20131325) was procured in the town library to provide religious guidance to the state.<ref>Moojan Momen, \"An Introduction to Shi'i Islam\", Yale Univ. Press, 1985, ''{{ISBN|0-300-03499-7}}'', p. 397</ref> The imported Shi'i ''[[ulama]]'' did not participate in the formation of Safavid religious policies during the early formation of the state. However, ''ghulat'' doctrines were later forsaken and Arab Twelver ''ulama'' from [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], and [[Bahrain]] were imported in increasing numbers to bolster orthodox Twelver practice and belief.\n\n=== Qizilbash aqidah in Anatolia ===\n{{main|Qalandariyya|Imadaddin Nasimi|Hurufism|Bektashism and folk religion}}\n{{further|Mansur Al-Hallaj|Sevener|Qarmatians|Baba Ishak|Babai revolt|Hassan II of Alamut |Muhammad II of Alamut}}\nIn Turkey, orthoprax Twelvers following [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] are called Ja'faris.

The organization was controlled through the office of ''khal\u012bf\u0101t al-khulaf\u0101'\u012b'' who appointed representatives (''khal\u012bfa'') in regions where Safavi propaganda was active. The ''khal\u012bfa'', in turn, had subordinates termed ''pira''. The Safavi presence in eastern Anatolia posed a serious threat to the [[Ottoman Empire]] because they encouraged the Shi'i population of Asia Minor to revolt against the sultan.\n\nIn 1499, Ismail, the young leader of the Safavi order, left Lahijan for Ardabil to make a bid for power. By the summer of 1500, about 7,000 supporters from the local Turcoman tribes of [[Asia Minor]] (Anatolia), [[Syria]], and the [[Caucasus]] \u2013 collectively called \"Qizilbash\" by their enemies \u2013 rallied to his support in [[Erzincan]].<ref>Faruk S\u00fcmer, ''Safevi Devletinin Kurulu\u015fu ve Geli\u015fmesinde Anadolu T\u00fcrklerinin Rol\u00fc'', T\u00fcrk Tarih Kurumu Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, Ankara, 1992, p. 15. {{in lang|tr}}</ref> Leading his troops on a punitive campaign against the Sh\u012brvansh\u0101h (ruler of [[Shirvan]]), he sought revenge for the death of his father and his grandfather in Sh\u012brvan.

The Qizilbash defeated a large Ottoman army under [[Sinan Pasha]].

Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and several other specific posts of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society with these Caucasian elements and who would question the power and hegemony of the tribal Qizilbash. This included the formation of a military slave system,<ref name=\"Streusand, p. 148\">Streusand, p. 148.</ref> similar to that of the neighboring [[Ottoman Empire]] \u2013 the [[janissaries]].<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barda-v|title=Barda and Barda-D\u0101ri v.

These new Caucasian elements (the so-called ''[[ghilman]]'' / \u063a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646 / ''\"servants\"''), almost always after conversion to Shi'ism depending on given function would be, unlike the Qizilbash, fully loyal only to the Shah. This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the [[Qajar Dynasty]].\n\nInter-tribal rivalry of the Turcomans, the attempt of Persian nobles to end the Turcoman dominance, and constant succession conflicts went on for another 10 years after Tahmasp's death. This heavily weakened the Safavid state and made the kingdom vulnerable to external enemies: the Ottomans [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|attacked]] in the west, whereas the Uzbeks attacked the east.\n[[Image:Daud Khan Undiladze.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daud Khan Undiladze]], Safavid ''ghulam'', military commander, and the governor of [[Karabakh]] and [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] between 1627 and 1633.]]\nIn 1588, [[Shah Abbas I]] came to power.

Later on, events of the past, including the role of the Turcomans in the succession struggles after the death of his father, and the counterbalancing influence of traditional [[Shia|Ithn\u0101\u02bbashari Shia]] [[Sayed]]s, made him determined to end the dominance of the untrustworthy Turcoman chiefs in Persia which Tahmasp had already started decades before him. In order to weaken the Turcomans \u2013 the important militant elite of the Safavid kingdom \u2013 Shah Abbas further raised a standing army, personal guard, Queen-Mothers, [[Harems]] and full civil administration from the ranks of these ''ghilman'' who were usually ethnic [[Circassians]], [[Georgians]], and [[Armenians]], both men and women, whom he and his predeseccors had taken captive en masse during their wars in the Caucasus, and would systematically replace the Qizilbash from their functions with converted [[Circassians]] and [[Georgians]]. The new army and civil administration would be fully loyal to the king personally and not to the clan-chiefs anymore.<ref name=\"EoI\" />\n\nThe reorganisation of the army also ended the independent rule of Turcoman chiefs in the Safavid provinces, and instead centralized the administration of those provinces.\n\n''Ghulams'' were appointed to high positions within the royal household, and by the end of Shah Abbas' reign, one-fifth of the high-ranking [[amir]]s were ghulams.<ref name=\"Minorsky\" /> By 1598 already an ethnic [[Georgians|Georgian]] from Safavid-ruled Georgia, well known by his adopted Muslim name after conversion, [[Allahverdi Khan]], had risen to the position of commander-in-chief of all Safavid armed forces.<ref>C.
