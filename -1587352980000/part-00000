This song was written for Grace Ella Modica of Long Island New York. Known as @gracemodica on Instagram. This is because of her big beautiful brown eyes. Written by Morrison and recorded in March 1967 for [[Bang Records]] owner and producer [[Bert Berns]], it was released as a single in June of the same year on the Bang label, peaking at number 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song spent a total of sixteen weeks on the chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/van-morrison|title=Van Morrison Brown Eyed Girl Chart History|website=Billboard}}</ref> It featured [[the Sweet Inspirations]] singing [[Backing vocalist|back-up vocals]] and is considered to be Van Morrison's [[signature song]].<ref>Yorke, Into the Music, p. 42</ref> \"Brown Eyed Girl\" has remained a staple on [[classic rock]] radio, and has been covered by hundreds of bands over the decades.\n\n==Recording and title==\nAfter finishing his contract with [[Decca Records]] and the mid-1966 break-up of his band, [[Them (band)|Them]], Morrison returned to Belfast seeking a new recording company. When he received a phone call from [[Bert Berns]], owner of [[Bang Records]], who had produced a number of recordings with Them, he flew to New York City and hastily signed a contract (which biographer [[Clinton Heylin]] says probably still gives him sleepless nights).<ref>Heylin, ''Can You Feel the Silence''. p.144-147</ref> During a two-day recording session starting 28 March 1967, he recorded eight songs intended to be used as four singles.<ref>Turner, Too Late to Stop Now. p.76</ref> The recording session took place at A & R Studios and \"Brown Eyed Girl\" was captured on the 22nd take on the first day.<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p. 152</ref> Of the musicians Berns had assembled, there were three guitarists \u2013 [[Eric Gale]], [[Hugh McCracken]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-illuminati.com/interview-jeff-barry/|title=Interview: Jeff Barry|publisher=music-illuminati.com|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref><ref>Rogan, ''No Surrender''. p.199</ref> and [[Al Gorgoni]] \u2013 plus bassist [[Russ Savakus]], pianist [[Paul Griffin (musician)|Paul Griffin]] and drummer [[Gary Chester]].<ref>Heylin, ''Can You Feel the Silence?''. p. 150</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gary-chester.com/biography.html |title=Meet Gary |publisher=gary-chester.com |accessdate=21 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116225941/http://www.gary-chester.com/biography.html |archivedate=16 January 2012 }}</ref> It was released as a single in mid-June 1967.<ref>Rogan, ''No Surrender''. p.201</ref>\n\nOriginally titled \"Brown-Skinned Girl\",<ref name = \"SpenceCut103\">{{cite web|url=http://www.folkways.si.edu/joseph-spence/the-complete-folkways-recordings-1958/caribbean-world/music/album/smithsonian|title=Smithsonian Folkways - Joseph Spence: The Complete Folkways Recordings, 1958|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2016}}</ref> Morrison changed it to \"Brown Eyed Girl\" when he recorded it.

A radio-edit of the song was released which removed the lyrics \"making love in the green grass\", replacing them with \"laughin' and a-runnin', hey hey\" from a previous verse. This edited version appears on some copies of the compilation album ''[[The Best of Van Morrison]]''. However, the remastered album seems{{clarify|date=October 2013}} to have the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]] lyrics in the packaging but the original \"racy\" lyrics on the disc. Lyrically, it \"shows early hints of the idealized pastoral landscapes that would flow through his songs through the decades, a tendency that links him to the Romantic poets, whom Morrison has cited as an influence\" according to music journalist Erik Hage.<ref>Hage, ''The Words and Music of Van Morrison'', pp. 33-34</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBecause of a contract he signed with Bang Records without legal advice, Morrison states that he has never received any [[royalties]] for writing or recording this song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martaypix.com/VAN_at_Rancho_Nicasio/VAN_Rancho.html|title=Van Morrison at Rancho Nicasio|publisher=martaypix.com|accessdate= 27 August 2008}}</ref> The contract made him liable for virtually all recording expenses incurred for all of his Bang Records recordings before royalties would be paid, and after those expenses were recouped, the revenue would become the \"subject of some highly creative accounting\".{{attribution needed|date=March 2018}}<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence. p.148</ref> Morrison vented frustration about this unjust contract in his sarcastic nonsense song \"The Big Royalty Check\". Morrison has stated that \"Brown Eyed Girl\" is not among his favourite songs, remarking \"it's not one of my best. I mean I've got about 300 songs that I think are better\".<ref>{{Cite video |title = TIME Magazine Interviews: Van Morrison | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date =26 February 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVHbUPNcTiU |minutes=4:14 |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nTo capitalise on the success of the single, producer Berns assembled the album ''[[Blowin' Your Mind!]]'' without Morrison's input or knowledge. Released in September 1967, the album contained the single as its lead-off track as well as songs recorded by Morrison at the March recording sessions for Berns. The album peaked at No. 182 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Legacy==\nMorrison's original recording of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains widely familiar today, as the uncensored version is regularly played by many \"[[oldies]]\" and \"[[classic rock]]\" radio stations. In 2005, Morrison received a Million-Air certificate by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as a \"Top European Writer\" for reaching 7 million US radio and television airplays for \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and again in 2007, Morrison was awarded another Million-Air certificate by BMI for 8 million air plays of \"Brown Eyed Girl\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|title=BMI Honors Top European Writers|date=28 November 2005|accessdate=23 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065908/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|archive-date=14 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/535578|title=Peter Gabriel Receives Top Honor at BMI Awards|publisher=BMI|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> In 2009, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" was at the top of the list for most played songs at the BMI London awards winning a Million-Air certificate for 9 million air plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/539750|title=BMI London Awards|date=9 October 2009|publisher=BMI|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> In 2011, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" joined an elite group of songs as it was honoured for having 10 million US radio air plays and therefore becoming one of the ten songs that have been registered with BMI that have received that number of radio plays.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/my-10-million-radio-plays-brown-eyed-girl-2896314.html|title=My 10 million radio plays Brown Eyed Girl|journal=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 October 2011|accessdate=21 January 2011}}</ref> As of 2015, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains the most downloaded and most played song of the entire 1960s decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6472929/revisionist-history-valentines-day-edition-captain-tennille |title=Revisionist History, Valentine's Day Edition: Captain & Tennille Crunches Aerosmith, Van Morrison Boots Lulu |last=Appel |first=Rich |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=14 February 2015 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] included \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in his book ''Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles'',<ref>Williams, Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles. p. 122</ref> writing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"I was going to say this is a song about sex, and it is, and a song about youth and growing up, and memory, and it's also\u2014very much and very wonderfully\u2014a song about singing.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis song proved to be the impetus for Morrison's career. It was his first single after leaving his position as lead singer for the [[Belfast]]-formed [[Them (band)|Them]] and led to his relocation to the United States and an eventual [[recording contract|contract]] with [[Warner Bros.

A radio-edit of the song was released which removed the lyrics \"making love in the green grass\", replacing them with \"laughin' and a-runnin', hey hey\" from a previous verse. This edited version appears on some copies of the compilation album ''[[The Best of Van Morrison]]''. However, the remastered album seems{{clarify|date=October 2013}} to have the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]] lyrics in the packaging but the original \"racy\" lyrics on the disc. Lyrically, it \"shows early hints of the idealized pastoral landscapes that would flow through his songs through the decades, a tendency that links him to the Romantic poets, whom Morrison has cited as an influence\" according to music journalist Erik Hage.<ref>Hage, ''The Words and Music of Van Morrison'', pp. 33-34</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBecause of a contract he signed with Bang Records without legal advice, Morrison states that he has never received any [[royalties]] for writing or recording this song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martaypix.com/VAN_at_Rancho_Nicasio/VAN_Rancho.html|title=Van Morrison at Rancho Nicasio|publisher=martaypix.com|accessdate= 27 August 2008}}</ref> The contract made him liable for virtually all recording expenses incurred for all of his Bang Records recordings before royalties would be paid, and after those expenses were recouped, the revenue would become the \"subject of some highly creative accounting\".{{attribution needed|date=March 2018}}<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence. p.148</ref> Morrison vented frustration about this unjust contract in his sarcastic nonsense song \"The Big Royalty Check\". Morrison has stated that \"Brown Eyed Girl\" is not among his favourite songs, remarking \"it's not one of my best. I mean I've got about 300 songs that I think are better\".<ref>{{Cite video |title = TIME Magazine Interviews: Van Morrison | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date =26 February 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVHbUPNcTiU |minutes=4:14 |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nTo capitalise on the success of the single, producer Berns assembled the album ''[[Blowin' Your Mind!]]'' without Morrison's input or knowledge. Released in September 1967, the album contained the single as its lead-off track as well as songs recorded by Morrison at the March recording sessions for Berns. The album peaked at No. 182 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Legacy==\nMorrison's original recording of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains widely familiar today, as the uncensored version is regularly played by many \"[[oldies]]\" and \"[[classic rock]]\" radio stations. In 2005, Morrison received a Million-Air certificate by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as a \"Top European Writer\" for reaching 7 million US radio and television airplays for \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and again in 2007, Morrison was awarded another Million-Air certificate by BMI for 8 million air plays of \"Brown Eyed Girl\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|title=BMI Honors Top European Writers|date=28 November 2005|accessdate=23 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065908/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|archive-date=14 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/535578|title=Peter Gabriel Receives Top Honor at BMI Awards|publisher=BMI|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> In 2009, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" was at the top of the list for most played songs at the BMI London awards winning a Million-Air certificate for 9 million air plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/539750|title=BMI London Awards|date=9 October 2009|publisher=BMI|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> In 2011, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" joined an elite group of songs as it was honoured for having 10 million US radio air plays and therefore becoming one of the ten songs that have been registered with BMI that have received that number of radio plays.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/my-10-million-radio-plays-brown-eyed-girl-2896314.html|title=My 10 million radio plays Brown Eyed Girl|journal=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 October 2011|accessdate=21 January 2011}}</ref> As of 2015, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains the most downloaded and most played song of the entire 1960s decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6472929/revisionist-history-valentines-day-edition-captain-tennille |title=Revisionist History, Valentine's Day Edition: Captain & Tennille Crunches Aerosmith, Van Morrison Boots Lulu |last=Appel |first=Rich |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=14 February 2015 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] included \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in his book ''Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles'',<ref>Williams, Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles. p. 122</ref> writing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"I was going to say this is a song about sex, and it is, and a song about youth and growing up, and memory, and it's also\u2014very much and very wonderfully\u2014a song about singing.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis song proved to be the impetus for Morrison's career. It was his first single after leaving his position as lead singer for the [[Belfast]]-formed [[Them (band)|Them]] and led to his relocation to the United States and an eventual [[recording contract|contract]] with [[Warner Bros.

On his death, the sponsorship is continued by his son Roy ([[Mammootty]]), who is a rich businessman. But Sherly does not know about him. She comes to College in the city where Roy's niece Mercy([[Sabitha Anand]]) is her classmate and she meets Roy still not knowing he is her sponsor. On the other hand, Alex ([[Lalu Alex]]) introduces his brother ''Baby'' ([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]) to Roy, and on Roy's advice Baby starts working in his firm.\n\nAt Mercy's birthday party, Baby meets Sherly and falls in love with her, but her mind has already gone for Roy, still without knowing that he is her sponsor, and she rejects Baby. Later Sherly finds that Roy has no feelings for her, although he is secretly in love with her but does not wish to reveal it because of the age gap between them and also because Baby confuses her by lying to her that Roy and Elsie ([[Seema (actress)|Seema]]) were in love for a long time and couldn't marry because of Roy's father. Sherly is extremely frustrated at this and in a fit of rage goes to Elsie and lies to her that she is pregnant with Roy's baby. Elsie is shocked at this and goes to his office and scolds him for his irresponsibility but Roy tells her that it was not him.\n\nHe calls Sherly to his office and shouts at her thinking that she is pregnant with Baby's baby and lied to the doctor that she was pregnant with his baby but she tells him that she was lying to break them up and also to prove her love for him and tells him that she cannot live without him. However, Mother Superior tells Roy that she was going to be sent to Italy to learn music and also that she was allowed to become a nun now and on Mother Superior's ([[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]]) advice she decides to become a nun although she doesn't want to and plans to leave to Italy due to her gratitude towards Mother and her sponsor.\n\nSo as a final meeting she sees Roy and tells him about this and that she cannot see him anymore. She also meets Baby and tells him everything including that she is an orphan and that she is going to be a nun. He, however, still was willing to marry her but she tells him that she is in love with someone else and he did not accept her so she decided to become a nun. He insists her on telling him who she is and she tells him that it is Roy. At this news he goes to Roy's office and shouts at him for what he did.\n\nBut as a last wish she wants to see her unknown sponsor who has blessed her all her life with what she would have never had. Mother Superior meets Roy and discloses Sherly's wish to meet her sponsor before she leaves for Italy, however he refuses. Mother Superior handles over a letter from Sherly, for the very first time without their censoring and leaves. But just before leaving, Sherly is told that her sponsor will meet her. She rushes down the orphanage corridor to find.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Mammootty]] as Roy Varghese\n* [[Shobhana]] as Sherly  - (Voice dubbed by [[Latha Raju]]) \n* [[Lalu Alex]] as Alex\n* [[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]] as Baby  - (Voice dubbed by [[Krishnachandran]]) \n* [[Seema (actress)|Seema]] as Dr. Elsie George  - (Voice dubbed by [[Kottayam Santha]]) \n* [[Sabitha Anand]] as Mercy  - (Voice dubbed by [[Bhagyalakshmi]]) \n* [[Unni Mary]] as Anne, Alex's wife  - (Voice dubbed by [[Leela Panicker]]) \n* [[Sukumari]] as Roy's mother\n* [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Bahadoor]] as Mathappan\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n[[S.

On his death, the sponsorship is continued by his son Roy ([[Mammootty]]), who is a rich businessman. But Sherly does not know about him. She comes to College in the city where Roy's niece Mercy([[Sabitha Anand]]) is her classmate and she meets Roy still not knowing he is her sponsor. On the other hand, Alex ([[Lalu Alex]]) introduces his brother ''Baby'' ([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]) to Roy, and on Roy's advice Baby starts working in his firm.\n\nAt Mercy's birthday party, Baby meets Sherly and falls in love with her, but her mind has already gone for Roy, still without knowing that he is her sponsor, and she rejects Baby. Later Sherly finds that Roy has no feelings for her, although he is secretly in love with her but does not wish to reveal it because of the age gap between them and also because Baby confuses her by lying to her that Roy and Elsie ([[Seema (actress)|Seema]]) were in love for a long time and couldn't marry because of Roy's father. Sherly is extremely frustrated at this and in a fit of rage goes to Elsie and lies to her that she is pregnant with Roy's baby. Elsie is shocked at this and goes to his office and scolds him for his irresponsibility but Roy tells her that it was not him.\n\nHe calls Sherly to his office and shouts at her thinking that she is pregnant with Baby's baby and lied to the doctor that she was pregnant with his baby but she tells him that she was lying to break them up and also to prove her love for him and tells him that she cannot live without him. However, Mother Superior tells Roy that she was going to be sent to Italy to learn music and also that she was allowed to become a nun now and on Mother Superior's ([[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]]) advice she decides to become a nun although she doesn't want to and plans to leave to Italy due to her gratitude towards Mother and her sponsor.\n\nSo as a final meeting she sees Roy and tells him about this and that she cannot see him anymore. She also meets Baby and tells him everything including that she is an orphan and that she is going to be a nun. He, however, still was willing to marry her but she tells him that she is in love with someone else and he did not accept her so she decided to become a nun. He insists her on telling him who she is and she tells him that it is Roy. At this news he goes to Roy's office and shouts at him for what he did.\n\nBut as a last wish she wants to see her unknown sponsor who has blessed her all her life with what she would have never had. Mother Superior meets Roy and discloses Sherly's wish to meet her sponsor before she leaves for Italy, however he refuses. Mother Superior handles over a letter from Sherly, for the very first time without their censoring and leaves. But just before leaving, Sherly is told that her sponsor will meet her. She rushes down the orphanage corridor to find.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Mammootty]] as Roy Varghese\n* [[Shobhana]] as Sherly  - (Voice dubbed by [[Latha Raju]]) \n* [[Lalu Alex]] as Alex\n* [[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]] as Baby  - (Voice dubbed by [[Krishnachandran]]) \n* [[Seema (actress)|Seema]] as Dr. Elsie George  - (Voice dubbed by [[Kottayam Santha]]) \n* [[Sabitha Anand]] as Mercy  - (Voice dubbed by [[Bhagyalakshmi]]) \n* [[Unni Mary]] as Anne, Alex's wife  - (Voice dubbed by [[Leela Panicker]]) \n* [[Sukumari]] as Roy's mother\n* [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Bahadoor]] as Mathappan\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n[[S.
