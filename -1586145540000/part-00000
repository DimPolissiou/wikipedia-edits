Director of the first Geological Commission of Portugal (1857), he led production of the first edition of the Geological Chart of Portugal to the scale of 1/500,000, work which was awarded a silver medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Universal Exhibition of Paris (1878)]]. He also served as an officer of the [[Portuguese army]] and as a Member of Parliament.\n\n==Biography==\nFrom relatively humble beginnings Carlos Ribeiro began work at an early age after only a basic education, continuing to study while working. During this time he met Filipe Folque (1800-1874), an aristocratic military officer and mathematician who supported him with his studies, enabling him to obtain the necessary qualifications to enrol at the tertiary level. After fighting in the [[Liberal wars|Portuguese Civil War (1828-34)]] in 1833-34, Ribeiro returned to studies by entering the Royal Academy of the Navy and, later, the Royal Academy of Fortification, Artillery and Drawing. His training earned him the rank of officer in 1837. In 1840 First-Lieutenant Ribeiro was transferred to [[Porto]] and there he entered the [[University of Porto|Polytechnic Academy]] to begin studies in [[geology]]. He carried out fieldwork in the area of Porto and began to develop his collections.<ref name=\"Instituto\">{{cite web |last1=Leit\u00e3o |first1=Vanda |title=Carlos Ribeiro (1813-1882) |url=http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/ciencia/p38.html |website=Instituto Cam\u00f5es |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"LNEG\">{{cite web |title=Biografia de Carlos Ribeiro (1814-1882) |url=http://www.lneg.pt/CienciaParaTodos/edicoes_online/biografias/carlos_ribeiro |website=LNEG |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he worked for the Lisbon Public Works Company, supervising works such as the construction of roads in the Lisbon area. He married Ursula Damasio, the sister of one of his teachers, in February 1846 and they had three children, Jos\u00e9 Victorino, Z\u00e9lia and Sofia. In June of the same year he was dismissed from employment and removed from military service as a result of his support for the popular uprising known as the [[Revolution of Maria da Fonte|Maria da Fonte revolution]], being imprisoned for a time during the [[Patuleia]], or Little Civil War, until an amnesty was granted in June 1847 following the [[Convention of Gramido]].<ref name=Instituto/><ref name=\"LNEG\"/>\n\nIn 1849 he joined the staff of a private company that had coal-mining concessions near [[Bu\u00e7aco]] and [[Cabo Mondego]]. His duties obliged him to cover a large part of the country, inspecting mines, quarries, etc., which allowed him to undertake fieldwork to gather rock and [[Paleontology|paleontological]] samples that would later be incorporated into the government\u2019s collection. He began to publish papers on his findings and also on topics such as cartography, general geology, prehistoric anthropology and archaeology. In 1850 in Bu\u00e7aco Ribeiro met the English geologist [[Daniel Sharpe]] (1806\u201356), who had studied the geology of Portugal, and helped him with the translation and scientific revision of his publications. This brought Ribeiro to international attention and gave him the reputation of being the founder of Portuguese [[stratigraphy]].<ref name=Instituto/><ref name=\"LNEG\"/>\n\nIn 1852, with support from [[Fontes Pereira de Melo]] (1819-1887), a politician who had studied with him in the Royal Academy of Fortification, Ribeiro was appointed Head of the 4th section of the Technical Department of the General Directorate of Public Works, in charge of superintending mines, quarries and geological works. Together with F. A. Pereira da Costa (1809-1888), he developed the law on mines that was decreed on December 31, 1852. In 1859 he was appointed Head of the 2nd Division of the General Directorate of Public Works and Mines. He also doubled as Chief of the Geological Service. Within the framework of the Ministry of Public Works, the Geological Commission of Portugal was created in 1857 and Ribeiro was appointed Director-member of that Commission, a position shared jointly with Pereira da Costa. The purpose of the Geological Commission was to prepare the geological map of mainland Portugal, a difficult task given the limited human resources available. Due to disagreements within the Commission, it was dissolved in February 1868, to be converted about one year later in one of the sections of the General Directorate of Geodetic Works under the supervision of Ribeiro.<ref name=Instituto/><ref name=\"LNEG\"/>\n\nIn 1863, Ribeiro undertook research in the field of [[prehistory]]. He was responsible for finding the Muge [[Mesolithic]] Shell [[Middens]] (''Concheiros de Muge'') while studying the [[Tagus]] valley. His enthusiasm for the Mesolithic and [[Neolithic]] periods was one factor in taking the 9th International Congress of PreHistorical Anthropology and Archaeology to Lisbon in 1880, two years before his death. Among other sites identified and/or excavated by Ribeiro were [[megalithic]] tombs such as the [[Anta da Pedra dos Mouros]], [[Anta das Pedras Grandes]], [[Anta de Agualva]], [[Anta da Estria]], [[Anta do Alto da Toupeira]], and the [[Anta do Monte Abra\u00e3o]].<ref name=\"Porto\">{{cite web |title=University of Porto Famous Alumni: Carlos Ribeiro |url=https://sigarra.up.pt/up/en/web_base.gera_pagina?P_pagina=1006705 |website=University of Porto: Sigarra |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, he published a groundbreaking work on the forests of Portugal.

COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.
