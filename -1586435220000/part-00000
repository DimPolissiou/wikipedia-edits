Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on''\n\n''the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary of his character Sherlock Holmes.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \u201cher plots are possible, logical, and always new.\u201d<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \u201cAt the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering \u2018How can this be happening?\u2019 Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe \u201cQueen of Fictional Crime\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fane|first=Vernon|url=|title=The World of Books|date=23 March 1946|work=The Sphere|access-date=|url-status=live|page=3}}</ref> developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of detective fiction.

Christie\u2019s British literary agent later wrote to her U.S. representative, authorizing American publishers to \u201comit the word \u2018Jew\u2019 when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\u201d<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on''\n\n''the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary of his character Sherlock Holmes. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \u201cher plots are possible, logical, and always new.\u201d<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \u201cAt the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering \u2018How can this be happening?\u2019 Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe \u201cQueen of Fictional Crime\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fane|first=Vernon|url=|title=The World of Books|date=23 March 1946|work=The Sphere|access-date=|url-status=live|page=3}}</ref> developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of detective fiction.

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the U.S. sent an official letter of complaint to Christie\u2019s American publishers, ''Dodd, Mead and Company'', regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie\u2019s British literary agent later wrote to her U.S. representative, authorizing American publishers to \u201comit the word \u2018Jew\u2019 when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\u201d<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''Three Act Tragedy''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Plays ====\nIn 1928, ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' was adapted for the stage by Michael Morton under the title ''[[Alibi (play)|Alibi]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|177}} While the play enjoyed a respectable run, Christie disliked the changes made to her original work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself.

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes.

The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

George died just three years later, in 1730, and the village was then under the control of his son Robert Rochfort (soon to become [[Earl of Belvedere|1st Earl of Belvedere]]). On the death of the 1st Earl, the village passed to his son and heir [[George Augustus Rochfort]], the 2nd Earl of Belvedere.\n\nIn 1797 Lt. Col.

The other great Rochfort estate at [[Gaulstown, County Westmeath|Gaulstown]] passed to [[John Browne, 1st Baron Kilmaine|Lord Kilmaine]]. In 1847 Josias Cooper and Lord Kilmaine rebuilt the village as part of a famine relief programme.

In many cases diplomatically inimical Arab nations became more cooperative with Iran, while some formerly supportive nations decreased their support.\n\n[[Ruhollah Khomeini]], leader of the revolution, founder of the [[Islamic Republic]] of Iran, and its first [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], declared that, \"The concept of monarchy totally contradicts [[Islam]].\" Therefore, [[Arab leaders]] developed a hostile attitude towards the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khomeini's idea of supporting the ''mustazafeen'' (those who are wronged or oppressed) \u2013 as opposed to the ''mustakbareen'' (those who are arrogant) \u2013 led to many problems with neighboring countries due to some Arab regimes being judged by Iranian jurists to be among the ''mustakbareen''. [[Ayatollah]] Khomeini was open about his intention to export the revolution to other parts of the Muslim world. Thus, during the early 1980s, Iran was isolated regionally and internationally. This diplomatic and economic isolation intensified during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] in which almost all neighboring Arab states, except [[Syria]], supported Iraq logistically and economically. According to some observers, [[Saddam Hussein]] fought on behalf of other Arab states that viewed Iran as a potential threat to their stability.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the revolutionary zeal cooled and a degree of pragmatism was adopted by Iranian policy makers. During the presidency of [[Akbar Hashemi]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]], Iranian foreign policy switched to reducing international tensions and Iran tried to normalize its relations with its Arab neighbors. When the United States attacked Iraq in the [[Gulf War]] of the early 1990s, it unintentionally promoted Iran's political influence in the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nSince 2000 the situation has changed completely. The most significant factor was the United States administration's decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq in 2003]], which led to the fall of Saddam, a Ba'athist leader with pan-Arab sympathies who was determined to balance [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] Iran's regional influence. With the deposition of Saddam, Iran found a major obstacle to its expansion removed. This gave Iran a good chance to emerge as a major player in the Middle East.\nAs [[Richard Haass]] stated in 2006, \"Iran will be one of the two most powerful states in the region. ... The influence of Iran and groups associated with it has been reinforced.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Haass | first=Richard N. | authorlink=Richard N.

During the early days of the Iranian Revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini endeavored to bridge the gap between Shias and Sunnis by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali. He also declared it permissible for Shiites to pray behind Sunni [[imams]]. However, the influence of Iran on Shiite communities outside its borders and the territorial disputes with Arab neighbors among other issues remain sources of tension in Arab-Iranian relations.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Cablegate|Diplomatic cables leaked]] in 2010 revealed Arab leaders singled out Iran as the greatest threat to regional stability, yet refuse to speak publicly, telling US diplomats in private, they would face domestic troubles if they were seen as siding with the West against a Muslim country.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/behind_the_arabs_iran_double_talk_9mE4WZdSHMXvGzg1we1ZDI Behind the Arabs' Iran double talk], by Eric Trager, New York Post, 12 December 2010</ref> The cables showed that Saudi Arabia and Bahrain supported a military attack against Iran aimed to stop the [[Iranian nuclear program]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/wikileaks-exposed-iran-s-weak-foreign-policies-says-opposition-1.330191 Wikileaks exposed Iran's weak foreign policies, says opposition], Ha'aretz, 12.12.10</ref>\n\nOn 4 January 2016, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Iran.

Fearful of a recurrence, the episode caused Bahrain to crack down on its Shia population putting thousands into jail and further souring relations with Shia Iran.

In the same year, [[Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt|Princess Fawzia]] of Egypt, the sister of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk I]], married [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran. The relationship between Iran and Egypt had fallen into open hostility under [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] presidency. Following his death in 1970, President Sadat turned this around quickly into an open and cordial friendship. In 1971, Sadat addressed the Iranian parliament in Tehran in fluent [[Persian language|Persian]], describing the 2500-year-old historic connectivity between the two nations. Overnight, Egypt and Iran were turned from bitter enemies into fast friends. The relationship between [[Cairo]] and [[Tehran]] became so friendly that the [[Shah]] of Iran (Persia), [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], called Sadat his \"dear brother.\" After the 1973 war with Israel, Iran assumed a leading role in cleaning up and reactivating the blocked [[Suez Canal]] with heavy investment. Iran also facilitated the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied [[Sinai Peninsula]] by promising to substitute with free Iranian oil the loss of the oil to the Israelis if they withdrew from the Egyptian oil wells in Western Sinai. All these added more to the personal friendship between Sadat and the Shah of Iran.\n\nOnce again, relations between the two countries collapsed with the sudden eruption of the [[Iranian Revolution]] in Iran in 1978\u201379. When the Shah fell, Egypt was bound to disapprove of his replacement, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], who returned the sentiment in full measure. Furthermore, in 1979, [[Anwar Sadat]] infuriated the new Iranian government by welcoming [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the exiled [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], for a short, but indefinite, stay.<ref name=\"BBC1117379\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1117379.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Sadat's assassin honoured again in Teheran |date=14 January 2001 |accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> In 1979, Iran officially cut all ties with Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/07/200971541743423270.html |title=Rivals set to meet at NAM summit \u2013 Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> This move was a response to the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]], as well as Egypt's support for Iraq in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref name=\"BBC3369821\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3369821.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Egypt wooed with new street name |date=5 January 2004 |accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>  In 1981, Iran symbolically dedicated a street to [[Khaled Islambouli]], Sadat's assassin.<ref name=\"BBC3369821\" />\n\nWhile trade relations slowly improved during the 1990s,<ref name=\"BBC3369821\" /> Khaled al-Islambouli was honored for a second time in 2001 \"with a huge new mural\" in Tehran.<ref name=\"BBC1117379\" /> Two years later, in late 2003, Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] met with the Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] in Geneva.

Several days later on 22 September, Iraq invaded Iran in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. Lasting until 1988, the brutal war killed over one million people and critically soured Arab\u2013Iranian relations. The Iranian government officially viewed the conflict not as Arab vs. Iranian but from a religious perspective of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] versus [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], although many in Iran did view the conflict as an Arab versus Iran issue. In Iraq, the conflict was continually presented in a historical context as Arab versus [[Persian people|Persian]]. The impact of the war was devastating to relations in the region; general Arab support for Iraq and a fear of Shia Muslims led to many disputes between Iran and the other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]]. The war was a primary cause for the rise of [[Anti-Arabism in Iran|anti-Arabism within Iran]], which had until then been largely insignificant.

However, this quickly turned sour when Kuwait supported Iraq on its [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|war against Iran]], and there had been no official relations between Kuwait and Iran for nearly 10 years after it started to fear about the threat from the legacy of Iranian Revolution.\n\nIn 1990, following the [[Gulf War]], Iraqi\u2013Kuwaiti relations suffered bitterly and consequently Kuwaiti\u2013Iranian relations began to greatly improve and flourish. Bilateral relations were gradually strengthened, partly because Iran and Kuwait were both invaded by [[Saddam Hussein]] and with exchanges of Iranian and Kuwaiti political and economic delegations leading to the signing of several economic and trade agreements. In February 2006, Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] visited Kuwait opening a new chapter in relations between the two countries.

ARSO, 2 January 2005</ref>\n\n===Oman===\n{{main|Iran\u2013Oman relations}}\n\n[[Oman]] and Iran share close [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], economic, and [[military]] ties. According to Kenneth Katzman of the [[Congressional Research Service]], \"Oman has a tradition of cooperation with Iran dating back to the [[Shah of Iran]]'s regime and Oman has always been less alarmed by the perceived threat from Iran than have the other Gulf states.\" Unlike the majority of its [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf neighbors]], Oman managed to uphold diplomatic relations with both sides during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] from 1980\u20131988 and strongly supported UN Security Council resolutions to end the conflict. Secret cease-fire talks between the two adversaries were held in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] during the war, and although an agreement was never reached during these talks, they did reduce distrust on both sides. Moreover, after the war, Oman mediated talks to restore diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran and the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring the [[Persian Gulf War]], Iran\u2013Oman relations were damaged after Iran began running attacks on tanker movements in the [[Persian Gulf]] and placed anti-ship missile launchers along the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. The Gulf neighbors have since restored their ties and have conducted joint military exercises as recently as February 2011. Oman's leader [[Sultan Qaboos]] traveled to Iran in 2009 for the first time since [[Iran Revolution|Iran's 1979 revolution]]. Though on two occasions the U.S. has dispatched high-level officials to discuss Iran with Oman, the fact that Oman has avoided publicly expressing any concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program is likely a reason why the two states have managed to maintain strong ties.\n\nIn addition to strong diplomatic and political ties, Iran and Oman cooperate economically on several fronts, including energy. Most recently, the Gulf neighbors signed an initial agreement to begin supplying large quantities of natural gas from Iran to Oman, a project that was earlier reported to be worth between $7\u201312 billion. In addition to these major economic projects, the two countries have opened a joint bank to facilitate their mutual financial dealings, agreed to develop the Kish and Hengam gas fields in the Gulf, and signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] for a potential joint petrochemical project valued at $800 million.\n\nAbout [[Iran nuclear program]], the Omani government official position on Iran's nuclear program is as follows: \"The sultanate hopes Washington will engage in a \u2018direct dialogue\u2019 with Teheran to resolve the crisis over the Iranian nuclear program. The sultanate has no reason not to believe Iran's assurances that its program has purely civilian purposes. This region, no doubt, does not want to see any military confrontation or any tension\".\n\nFrom July 2012 to October 2013, all [[Iran]]ian interests in the [[United Kingdom]] were maintained by the Omani embassy in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oman to represent Iran interests in UK|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2012/07/15/251063/oman-to-represent-iran-interests-in-uk/|publisher=[[Press TV]]|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Palestine===\n{{Main|Iran\u2013Palestine relations}}\nIran (after the 1979 Iranian Revolution) closed the Israeli embassy in Tehran and replaced it with a Palestinian embassy. Iran favors Palestinian national ambitions and officially endorses the replacement of Israel with a unitary Palestinian state or whatever choice the Palestinian people decide through a democratic vote.\n\nSeveral Palestinian groups, including [[Hamas]], are Iranian allies. The Iranian government also gives substantial assistance to the [[Hamas]] government in [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which depends on outside sources for an estimated 90% of its budget. Iranian support has not been unconditional however, and in July and August 2011 Iran cut funding to show its displeasure at \"Hamas's failure to hold public rallies in support\" of [[Syria]]n President [[Bashir al-Assad]] during the [[2011 Syrian uprising]]. In part for this reason, Hamas was unable to pay July salaries of its \"40,000 civil service and security employees.\"<ref name=SMH>[https://www.smh.com.au/world/iran-punishes-hamas-for-not-backing-assad-20110822-1j6lb.html#ixzz1Vy95go2v Iran punishes Hamas for not backing Assad]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}| 23 August 2011</ref>\n\nIran does not recognize the state of Israel and instead regards it as 'Palestine under occupation'. During the era of the Iranian Monarchy (1948\u20131979) under the Pahlavi Dynasty, Iran enjoyed cordial relations with Israel. Israel regarded Iran, a non-Arab power on the periphery of the Arab world, as a natural ally and counterweight to Arab ambitions as part of [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s [[alliance of the periphery]]. Even after the Iranian Revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini's public condemnations of the \"[[Zionist entity]]\". Iran suggests that all Israeli 'occupied territory' is either given back to their respective countries (ex. [[Golan Heights]] back to Syria) or is replaced with a Palestinian state. Iran also feels that Jerusalem should given to the Palestinians.\n\n===Qatar===\n{{main|Iran\u2013Qatar relations}}\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Foreign relations of Qatar]] -->\nIn 1969, Iran and Qatar signed a demarcation agreement.<ref name=\"Mokhtari\"/>\n\nThroughout the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), Qatar supported Saddam Hussein's Iraq financially by providing large loans and cash gifts.

However, Qatar maintains security cooperation with Iran through bilateral ties.

In many cases diplomatically inimical Arab nations became more cooperative with Iran, while some formerly supportive nations decreased their support.\n\n[[Ruhollah Khomeini]], leader of the revolution, founder of the [[Islamic Republic]] of Iran, and its first [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], declared that, \"The concept of monarchy totally contradicts [[Islam]].\" Therefore, [[Arab leaders]] developed a hostile attitude towards the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khomeini's idea of supporting the ''mustazafeen'' (those who are wronged or oppressed) \u2013 as opposed to the ''mustakbareen'' (those who are arrogant) \u2013 led to many problems with neighboring countries due to some Arab regimes being judged by Iranian jurists to be among the ''mustakbareen''. [[Ayatollah]] Khomeini was open about his intention to export the revolution to other parts of the Muslim world. Thus, during the early 1980s, Iran was isolated regionally and internationally. This diplomatic and economic isolation intensified during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] in which almost all neighboring Arab states, except [[Syria]], supported Iraq logistically and economically. According to some observers, [[Saddam Hussein]] fought on behalf of other Arab states that viewed Iran as a potential threat to their stability.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the revolutionary zeal cooled and a degree of pragmatism was adopted by Iranian policy makers. During the presidency of [[Akbar Hashemi]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]], Iranian foreign policy switched to reducing international tensions and Iran tried to normalize its relations with its Arab neighbors. When the United States attacked Iraq in the [[Gulf War]] of the early 1990s, it unintentionally promoted Iran's political influence in the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nSince 2000 the situation has changed completely. The most significant factor was the United States administration's decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq in 2003]], which led to the fall of Saddam, a Ba'athist leader with pan-Arab sympathies who was determined to balance [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] Iran's regional influence. With the deposition of Saddam, Iran found a major obstacle to its expansion removed.

In the same year, [[Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt|Princess Fawzia]] of Egypt, the sister of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk I]], married [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran. The relationship between Iran and Egypt had fallen into open hostility under [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] presidency. Following his death in 1970, President Sadat turned this around quickly into an open and cordial friendship. In 1971, Sadat addressed the Iranian parliament in Tehran in fluent [[Persian language|Persian]], describing the 2500-year-old historic connectivity between the two nations. Overnight, Egypt and Iran were turned from bitter enemies into fast friends. The relationship between [[Cairo]] and [[Tehran]] became so friendly that the [[Shah]] of Iran (Persia), [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], called Sadat his \"dear brother.\" After the 1973 war with Israel, Iran assumed a leading role in cleaning up and reactivating the blocked [[Suez Canal]] with heavy investment. Iran also facilitated the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied [[Sinai Peninsula]] by promising to substitute with free Iranian oil the loss of the oil to the Israelis if they withdrew from the Egyptian oil wells in Western Sinai. All these added more to the personal friendship between Sadat and the Shah of Iran.\n\nOnce again, relations between the two countries collapsed with the sudden eruption of the [[Iranian Revolution]] in Iran in 1978\u201379. When the Shah fell, Egypt was bound to disapprove of his replacement, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], who returned the sentiment in full measure.

Lasting until 1988, the brutal war killed over one million people and critically soured Arab\u2013Iranian relations. The Iranian government officially viewed the conflict not as Arab vs. Iranian but from a religious perspective of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] versus [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], although many in Iran did view the conflict as an Arab versus Iran issue. In Iraq, the conflict was continually presented in a historical context as Arab versus [[Persian people|Persian]]. The impact of the war was devastating to relations in the region; general Arab support for Iraq and a fear of Shia Muslims led to many disputes between Iran and the other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]].

The support to the [[Polisario Front]] continued during the 1980s, allowing the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] national liberation movement to open a diplomatic representation in [[Tehran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arso.org/01-e05-0102.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012634/http://www.arso.org/01-e05-0102.htm |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy }} Death of Mohamed Salem El Hadj M'Barek. ARSO, 2 January 2005</ref>\n\n===Oman===\n{{main|Iran\u2013Oman relations}}\n\n[[Oman]] and Iran share close [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], economic, and [[military]] ties. According to Kenneth Katzman of the [[Congressional Research Service]], \"Oman has a tradition of cooperation with Iran dating back to the [[Shah of Iran]]'s regime and Oman has always been less alarmed by the perceived threat from Iran than have the other Gulf states.\" Unlike the majority of its [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf neighbors]], Oman managed to uphold diplomatic relations with both sides during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] from 1980\u20131988 and strongly supported UN Security Council resolutions to end the conflict. Secret cease-fire talks between the two adversaries were held in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] during the war, and although an agreement was never reached during these talks, they did reduce distrust on both sides. Moreover, after the war, Oman mediated talks to restore diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran and the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring the [[Persian Gulf War]], Iran\u2013Oman relations were damaged after Iran began running attacks on tanker movements in the [[Persian Gulf]] and placed anti-ship missile launchers along the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. The Gulf neighbors have since restored their ties and have conducted joint military exercises as recently as February 2011. Oman's leader [[Sultan Qaboos]] traveled to Iran in 2009 for the first time since [[Iran Revolution|Iran's 1979 revolution]]. Though on two occasions the U.S. has dispatched high-level officials to discuss Iran with Oman, the fact that Oman has avoided publicly expressing any concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program is likely a reason why the two states have managed to maintain strong ties.\n\nIn addition to strong diplomatic and political ties, Iran and Oman cooperate economically on several fronts, including energy. Most recently, the Gulf neighbors signed an initial agreement to begin supplying large quantities of natural gas from Iran to Oman, a project that was earlier reported to be worth between $7\u201312 billion. In addition to these major economic projects, the two countries have opened a joint bank to facilitate their mutual financial dealings, agreed to develop the Kish and Hengam gas fields in the Gulf, and signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] for a potential joint petrochemical project valued at $800 million.\n\nAbout [[Iran nuclear program]], the Omani government official position on Iran's nuclear program is as follows: \"The sultanate hopes Washington will engage in a \u2018direct dialogue\u2019 with Teheran to resolve the crisis over the Iranian nuclear program. The sultanate has no reason not to believe Iran's assurances that its program has purely civilian purposes. This region, no doubt, does not want to see any military confrontation or any tension\".\n\nFrom July 2012 to October 2013, all [[Iran]]ian interests in the [[United Kingdom]] were maintained by the Omani embassy in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oman to represent Iran interests in UK|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2012/07/15/251063/oman-to-represent-iran-interests-in-uk/|publisher=[[Press TV]]|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Palestine===\n{{Main|Iran\u2013Palestine relations}}\nIran (after the 1979 Iranian Revolution) closed the Israeli embassy in Tehran and replaced it with a Palestinian embassy. Iran favors Palestinian national ambitions and officially endorses the replacement of Israel with a unitary Palestinian state or whatever choice the Palestinian people decide through a democratic vote.\n\nSeveral Palestinian groups, including [[Hamas]], are Iranian allies. The Iranian government also gives substantial assistance to the [[Hamas]] government in [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which depends on outside sources for an estimated 90% of its budget. Iranian support has not been unconditional however, and in July and August 2011 Iran cut funding to show its displeasure at \"Hamas's failure to hold public rallies in support\" of [[Syria]]n President [[Bashir al-Assad]] during the [[2011 Syrian uprising]]. In part for this reason, Hamas was unable to pay July salaries of its \"40,000 civil service and security employees.\"<ref name=SMH>[https://www.smh.com.au/world/iran-punishes-hamas-for-not-backing-assad-20110822-1j6lb.html#ixzz1Vy95go2v Iran punishes Hamas for not backing Assad]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}| 23 August 2011</ref>\n\nIran does not recognize the state of Israel and instead regards it as 'Palestine under occupation'. During the era of the Iranian Monarchy (1948\u20131979) under the Pahlavi Dynasty, Iran enjoyed cordial relations with Israel. Israel regarded Iran, a non-Arab power on the periphery of the Arab world, as a natural ally and counterweight to Arab ambitions as part of [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s [[alliance of the periphery]]. Even after the Iranian Revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini's public condemnations of the \"[[Zionist entity]]\". Iran suggests that all Israeli 'occupied territory' is either given back to their respective countries (ex. [[Golan Heights]] back to Syria) or is replaced with a Palestinian state. Iran also feels that Jerusalem should given to the Palestinians.\n\n===Qatar===\n{{main|Iran\u2013Qatar relations}}\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Foreign relations of Qatar]] -->\nIn 1969, Iran and Qatar signed a demarcation agreement.<ref name=\"Mokhtari\"/>\n\nThroughout the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), Qatar supported Saddam Hussein's Iraq financially by providing large loans and cash gifts. Iran's claim in May 1989 that one-third of Qatar's North Field gas reservoir lay under Iranian waters apparently was resolved by an agreement to exploit the field jointly.\n\nQatar has maintained cordial relations with Iran. In 1991, following the end of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], former emir of Qatar [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani|Hamad bin Khalifa]] welcomed Iranian participation in Persian Gulf security arrangements, however due to resistance from other [[Persian Gulf Arab States]], these never came into fruition. However, Qatar maintains security cooperation with Iran through bilateral ties. Additionally, plans were being formulated in 1992 to pipe water from the Karun River in Iran to Qatar, but after local resistance in Iran this was laid to rest.\n\nThe Iranian community in Qatar, although large, is well integrated and has not posed a threat to the regime. As of 2012 relations between the two countries were cordial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/80.htm|title=Qatar \u2013 Foreign Relations |publisher=Country Studies|date=23 June 1992|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\n{{Main|Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia relations}}\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], Iranian pilgrims held a political demonstration about Saudi moving in direction of United States and do not take any action against Israel during the [[Hajj]] in [[Mecca]]. In 1987 they succeeded; however, [[Saudi police]] crushed the demonstration violently causing the [[Iranian pilgrim riot|Iranian pilgrims to riot]]. Immediately following the riot, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] called for Muslims to avenge the pilgrims' deaths by overthrowing the [[Saudi royal family]]. The Saudi government blamed the riot on the Iranian pilgrims and claimed that the pilgrim riot had been part of a plot to destabilize their rule. The following day mobs attacked the Saudi embassies in Tehran.\n\nIn 2001, Iran and Saudi Arabia signed a \"major security accord to combat drug trafficking and organized crime\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/806268.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Timeline: Iran |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415072318/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/806268.stm|archivedate=15 April 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the Saudi King Abdullah invited former [[President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] to visit Saudi Arabia for the purpose of attending an Islamic conference.

People can also become infected with [[respiratory disease]]s such as [[influenza]] or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes). The five critical moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important include: before and after [[defecation]], after cleaning a child's bottom or changing [[Diaper|nappies]], before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.<ref name=\":2\" />  If [[water]] and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with [[ash]].<ref name=\"hip.fhi360.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hip.fhi360.org/page/2644.html|title=The Hygiene Improvement Project (HIP) \u2013 Tippy-Tap: A simple low-cost technology for handwashing when water is scarce|website=USAID|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025004538/http://www.hip.fhi360.org/page/2644.html|archivedate=25 October 2014|accessdate=30 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMedical hand [[hygiene]] refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.

They found that:\n* The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of {{convert|180|m/s|km/h mi/h|abbr=on}}, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.\n* Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.\n* Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.\n\nIn 2005, in a study conducted by T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity. Most are based on [[isopropyl alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] formulated together with a [[thickening agent]] such as [[Carbomer]] (polymer of [[acrylic acid]]) into a gel, or a [[humectant]] such as [[glycerin]] into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Menegueti|first=Mayra Gon\u00e7alves|last2=Laus|first2=Ana Maria|last3=Ciol|first3=M\u00e1rcia Aparecida|last4=Auxiliadora-Martins|first4=Maria|last5=Basile-Filho|first5=Anibal|last6=Gir|first6=Elucir|last7=Pires|first7=Daniela|last8=Pittet|first8=Didier|last9=Bellissimo-Rodrigues|first9=Fernando|date=2019-06-24|title=Glycerol content within the WHO ethanol-based handrub formulation: balancing tolerability with antimicrobial efficacy|journal=Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control|volume=8|issue=1|pages=109|doi=10.1186/s13756-019-0553-z|issn=2047-2994|pmc=6591802|pmid=31285821}}</ref> Adding diluted [[Hydrogen peroxide|hydrogen-peroxide]] increases further  the antimicrobial activity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Information|first=National Center for Biotechnology|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK144054/|title=WHO-recommended handrub formulations|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.

They found that:\n* The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of {{convert|180|m/s|km/h mi/h|abbr=on}}, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.\n* Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.\n* Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.\n\nIn 2005, in a study conducted by T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1947, these on-going tensions erupted into [[1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] following the 29 November 1947 adoption of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], which planned to divide Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state, and the Special International Regime encompassing the cities of [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]].\n\nOn 15 May 1948, the civil war transformed into a conflict between Israel and the Arab states following the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] the previous day. Egypt, Transjordan, [[Syrian Republic (1946\u201363)|Syria]], and expeditionary forces from Iraq entered Palestine.<ref>David Tal, ''War in Palestine, 1948: Israeli and Arab Strategy and Diplomacy,'' p. 153.</ref> The invading forces took control of the Arab areas and immediately attacked Israeli forces and several Jewish settlements.<ref>Benny Morris (2008), p. 401.</ref><ref name=\"morris2008p236\"/><ref>Zeev Maoz, ''Defending the Holy Land'', University of Michigan Press, 2009 p. 4: 'A combined invasion of a Jordanian and Egyptian army started ...

Transjordan took control of the remainder of the former British mandate, which [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|it annexed]], and the Egyptian military [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|took control]] of the Gaza Strip.

They consolidated their presence in [[Galilee]] and [[Samaria]].<ref name=\"Yoav Gelber 2006 pp.51-56\">[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 51\u201356</ref> [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] came from Egypt with several hundred men of the [[Army of the Holy War]].

By March, Al-Hussayni's tactic had paid off. Almost all of [[Haganah]]'s armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 p.163\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 163</ref> The situation for those who dwelt in the Jewish settlements in the highly isolated [[Negev]] and North of Galilee was even more critical.\n\nWhile the Jewish population had received strict orders requiring them to hold their ground everywhere at all costs,<ref name=\"Larry Collins 1971 p.163\">[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 163</ref> the Arab population was more affected by the general conditions of insecurity to which the country was exposed.

The British, on the other hand, decided on 7 February 1948, to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.<ref name=\"Henry Laurens 2005 p.83\">[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], p. 83</ref>\n\nAlthough a certain level of doubt took hold among Yishuv supporters, their apparent defeats were due more to their wait-and-see policy than to weakness. [[David Ben-Gurion]] reorganized Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training. Thanks to funds raised by [[Golda Meir]] from sympathisers in the United States, and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] decision to support the [[Zionism|Zionist]] cause, the Jewish representatives of Palestine were able to sign very important armament contracts in the East. Other Haganah agents recuperated stockpiles from the Second World War, which helped improve the army's equipment and logistics. [[Operation Balak]] allowed arms and other equipment to be transported for the first time by the end of March.[[File:PikiWiki Israel 21221 The Palmach.JPG|thumb|Palmach [[M4 Sherman]] tank leading a convoy.]]\n\nBen-Gurion invested [[Yigael Yadin]] with the responsibility to come up with a plan of offense whose timing was related to the foreseeable evacuation of British forces. This strategy, called Plan Dalet, was readied by March and implemented towards the end of April.<ref>David Tal, ''War in Palestine, 1948: Israeli and Arab Strategy and Diplomacy,'' Routledge 2004 p. 89.</ref> A separate plan, [[Operation Nachshon]], was devised to lift the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|siege of Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"morris2008p116\"/> 1500 men from Haganah's Givati brigade and [[Palmach]]'s Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between 5 and 20 April. Both sides acted offensively in defiance of the Partition Plan, which foresaw Jerusalem as a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]], under neither Jewish nor Arab jurisdiction. The Arabs did not accept the Plan, while the Jews were determined to oppose the internationalization of the city, and secure it as part of the Jewish state.<ref>David Tal, pp. 89\u201390.</ref> The operation was successful, and enough foodstuffs to last two months were trucked into Jerusalem for distribution to the Jewish population.<ref>[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 369\u201381</ref> The success of the operation was assisted by the death of al-Husayni in combat. During this time, and independently of Haganah or the framework of Plan Dalet, irregular fighters from [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] formations massacred a substantial number of Arabs at [[Deir Yassin massacre|Deir Yassin]], an event that, though publicly deplored and criticized by the principal Jewish authorities, had a deep impact on the morale of the Arab population and contributed to generate the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|exodus of the Arab population]].\n\nAt the same time, the first large-scale operation of the Arab Liberation Army ended in a debacle, having been roundly defeated at [[Mishmar HaEmek]],<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 pp.242-243\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 242\u201343</ref> coinciding with the loss of their [[Druze]] allies through defection.<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 p.242\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 242</ref>\n\nWithin the framework of the establishment of Jewish territorial continuity foreseen by Plan Dalet, the forces of Haganah, Palmach and Irgun intended to conquer mixed zones. The Palestinian Arab society was shaken. [[Tiberias]], [[Haifa]], [[Safed]], [[Beisan]], [[Jaffa]] and [[Acre (city)|Acre]] fell, resulting in the flight of more than 250,000 Palestinian Arabs.<ref>[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nThe British had, at that time, essentially withdrawn their troops. The situation pushed the leaders of the neighbouring Arab states to intervene, but their preparation was not finalized, and they could not assemble sufficient forces to turn the tide of the war. The majority of Palestinian Arab hopes lay with the [[Arab Legion]] of Transjordan's monarch, King Abdullah I, but he had no intention of creating a Palestinian Arab-run state, since he hoped to annex as much of the territory of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] as he could. He was playing a double-game, being just as much in contact with the Jewish authorities as with the Arab League.\n\nIn preparation for the offensive, Haganah successfully launched Operations [[Operation Yiftah|Yiftah]]<ref>[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 248\u201352</ref> and Ben-'Ami<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 pp.252\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 252\u201354</ref> to secure the Jewish settlements of [[Galilee]], and [[Operation Kilshon]], which created a united front around Jerusalem. The inconclusive meeting between [[Golda Meir]] and Abdullah I, followed by the [[Kfar Etzion massacre]] on 13 May by the Arab Legion led to predictions that the battle for Jerusalem would be merciless.\n\nOn 14 May 1948, [[David Ben-Gurion]] declared the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] and the [[1948 Palestine war]] entered its second phase with the intervention of the Arab state armies and the beginning of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War.\n\n===Armed forces===\nBy September 1947 the [[Haganah]] had \"10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine-guns, 672 two-inch mortars and 92 three-inch (76&nbsp;mm) mortars\".<ref name=\"morris_2003_16\"/>\n\n====Importing arms====\nIn 1946, Ben-Gurion decided that the Yishuv would probably have to defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and neighbouring Arab states and accordingly began a \"massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West\", and acquired many more during the first few months of hostilities. [[File:Avia S-199 in June 1948 (Israeli Air Force).png|thumb|An Israeli Avia S-199, in June 1948]]\n\nThe Yishuv managed to clandestinely amass arms and military equipment abroad for transfer to Palestine once the British blockade was lifted. In the [[United States]], Yishuv agents purchased three [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, one of which bombed Cairo in July 1948, some [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]] transport planes, and dozens of half-tracks, which were repainted and defined as \"agricultural equipment\". In Western Europe, [[Haganah]] agents amassed fifty 65mm French mountain guns, twelve 120mm mortars, ten [[Hotchkiss H35|H-35]] light tanks, and a large number of half-tracks. By mid-May or thereabouts the Yishuv had purchased from [[Czechoslovakia]] 25 [[Avia S-199]] fighters (an inferior version of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]), 200 heavy machine guns, 5,021 light machine guns, 24,500 rifles, and 52 million rounds of ammunition, enough to equip all units, but short of heavy arms.<ref>Martin Van Creveld, ''Sword and the Olive: A Critical History of the Israeli Defense Force'', Public Affairs (1998) 2002 p. 78</ref> The airborne arms smuggling missions from [[Czechoslovakia]] were codenamed [[Operation Balak]].\n\nThe airborne smuggling missions were carried out by mostly American aviators \u2013 Jews and non-Jews \u2013 led by ex-U.S. Air Transport Command flight engineer [[Al Schwimmer]].\n\nSchwimmer's operation also included recruiting and training fighter pilots such as [[Lou Lenart]], commander of the first Israeli air assault against the Arabs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/vLinkTitle/WING+AND+A+PRAYER+A|title = A Wing and a Prayer|website = American Public Television}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY4OZRbdoRc|accessdate = 11 December 2015|title = A Wing and a Prayer}}</ref>\n\n====Arms production====\nThe Yishuv also had \"a relatively advanced ''arms producing'' capacity\", that between October 1947 and July 1948\" produced 3&nbsp;million 9&nbsp;mm bullets, 150,000 [[Mills bomb|Mills grenades]], 16,000 submachine guns ([[Sten]] Guns) and 210 three-inch (76&nbsp;mm) mortars\",<ref name=\"morris_2003_16\"/> along with a few \"[[Davidka]]\" mortars, which had been indigenously designed and produced. They were inaccurate but had a spectacularly loud explosion that demoralized the enemy. A large amount of the munitions used by the Israelis came from the [[Machon Ayalon|Ayalon Institute]], a clandestine bullet factory underneath kibbutz [[Ajalon|Ayalon]], which produced about 2.5 million bullets for Sten guns. The munitions produced by the Ayalon Institute were said to have been the only supply that was not in shortage during the war. Locally produced explosives were also plentiful. After Israel's independence, these clandestine arms manufacturing operations no longer had to be concealed, and were moved above ground. All of the Haganah's weapons-manufacturing was centralized and later became [[Israel Military Industries]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/remembrance-and-independence-2013/how-a-fake-kibbutz-was-built-to-hide-a-bullet-factory.premium-1.515584|title=How a Fake Kibbutz Was Built to Hide a Bullet Factory|first=Debra|last=Kamin|date=15 April 2013|newspaper=Haaretz}}</ref>\n\n====Manpower====\nIn November 1947, the Haganah was an underground paramilitary force that had existed as a highly organized, national force, since the Arab riots of [[1920 Palestine riots|1920]]\u2013[[Jaffa riots|21]], and throughout the [[Riots in Palestine of 1929|riots of 1929]], [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Uprising of 1936\u201339]],<ref name=\"morris_2003_16\">Morris, 2003, p. 16.</ref> and World War 2.

The reservists trained three or four days a month{{Citation needed|reason=not true. where is the source?|date=November 2013}} and went back to civilian life the rest of the time. These mobile forces could rely on a garrison force, the HIM (''Heil Mishmar'', lit. Guard Corps), composed of people aged over 25.

As the war progressed, the aim of expanding the Jewish state beyond the UN partition borders appeared: first to incorporate clusters of isolated Jewish settlements and later to add more territories to the state and give it defensible borders. A third and further aim that emerged among the political and military leaders after four or five months was to \"reduce the size of Israel's prospective large and hostile Arab minority, seen as a potential powerful [[fifth column]], by belligerency and expulsion\".<ref name=\"morris_1948_397\"/>\n\n[[Plan Dalet]], or Plan D, ({{lang-he| \u05ea\u05d5\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3'}}, ''Tokhnit dalet'') was a plan worked out by the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary group and the forerunner of the Israel Defense Forces, in autumn 1947 to spring 1948, which was sent to Haganah units in early March 1948. According to the academic [[Ilan Papp\u00e9]], its purpose was to conquer as much of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and to expel as many Palestinians as possible,<ref>Pappe, Ilan. ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine''.</ref> though according to Benny Morris there was no such intent. In his book ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', Papp\u00e9 asserts that Plan Dalet was a \"blueprint for ethnic cleansing\" with the aim of reducing both rural and urban areas of Palestine.<ref>Papp\u00e9, 2006, pp.xii, 86\u2013126</ref> According to Gelber, the plan specified that in case of resistance, the population of conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule.<ref>Gelber 2006 p. 306</ref> According to Morris, Plan D called for occupying the areas within the U.N sponsored Jewish state, several concentrations of Jewish population outside those areas (West Jerusalem and Western Galilee), and areas along the roads where the invading Arab armies were expected to attack.<ref>Morris 2008 p. 119</ref>\n\nThe intent of Plan Dalet is subject to much controversy, with historians on the one extreme asserting that it was entirely defensive, and historians on the other extreme asserting that the plan aimed at maximum conquest and expulsion of the Palestinians.\n\nThe Yishuv perceived the peril of an Arab invasion as threatening its very existence.

One Spitfire was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and its pilot was taken prisoner. Throughout the next six days, the REAF would continue to attack Tel Aviv, causing civilian casualties. On 18 May, Egyptian warplanes attacked the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]], killing 42 people and wounding 100. In addition to their attacks on Tel Aviv, the Egyptians also bombed rural settlements and airfields, though few casualties were caused in these raids.<ref>Morris (2008), p. 261</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the war, the REAF was able to attack Israel with near impunity, due to the lack of Israeli fighter aircraft to intercept them,<ref>Morris, 2008, p. 235</ref> and met only ground fire.\n\nAs more effective air defenses were transferred to Tel Aviv, the Egyptians began taking significant aircraft losses. As a result of these losses, as well as the loss of five Spitfires downed by the British when the Egyptians mistakenly attacked [[Ramat David Airbase|RAF Ramat David]], the Egyptian air attacks became less frequent. By the end of May 1948, almost the entire REAF Spitfire squadron based in [[El Arish]] had been lost, including many of its best pilots.\n\nAlthough lacking fighter or bomber aircraft, in the first few days of the war, Israel's embryonic air force still attacked Arab targets, with light aircraft being utilized as makeshift bombers, striking Arab encampments and columns. The raids were mostly carried out at night to avoid interception by Arab fighter aircraft. These attacks usually had little effect, except on morale.\n[[File:Avia-S-199-IAF-101Sqn-Tel-Nof-Israel-1948-01.jpg|thumb|Avia S-199 Israeli 1st fighter aircraft]]\n[[File:Spitfire-MkIX-hatzerim-1-2.jpg|thumb|Israeli Spitfire F Mk]]\n[[File:Israeli B-17Gs 01011953.JPG|thumb|upright|Israeli B-17s in flight]]\n\nThe balance of air power soon began to swing in favor of the Israeli Air Force following the arrival of 25 [[Avia S-199]]s from [[Czechoslovakia]], the first of which arrived in Israel on 20 May. Ironically, Israel was using the Avia S-199, an inferior derivative of the [[Bf 109]] designed in [[Nazi Germany]] to counter British-designed Spitfires flown by Egypt. Throughout the rest of the war, Israel would acquire more Avia fighters, as well as 62 Spitfires from Czechoslovakia. On 28 May 1948, Sherut Avir became the Israeli Air Force.\n\nMany of the pilots who fought for the Israeli Air Force were [[Mahal (Israel)|foreign volunteers]] or mercenaries, including many [[World War II]] veterans.\n\nOn 3 June, Israel scored its first victory in aerial combat when Israeli pilot [[Modi Alon]] shot down a pair of Egyptian DC-3s that had just bombed Tel Aviv. Although Tel Aviv would see additional raids by fighter aircraft, there would be no more raids by bombers for the rest of the war. From then on, the [[Israeli Air Force]] began engaging the Arab air forces in air-to-air combat. The first dogfight took place on 8 June, when an Israeli fighter plane flown by Gideon Lichtman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. By the fall of 1948, the IAF had achieved [[air superiority]] and had superior firepower and more knowledgeable personnel, many of whom had seen action in World War II.<ref>Morris, 2001, pp. 217\u201318.</ref> Israeli planes then began intercepting and engaging Arab aircraft on bombing missions.\n\nFollowing Israeli air attacks on Egyptian and Iraqi columns, the Egyptians repeatedly bombed [[Tel Nof Airbase|Ekron Airfield]], where IAF fighters were based. During a 30 May raid, bombs aimed for Ekron hit central [[Rehovot]], killing 7 civilians and wounding 30. In response to this, and probably to the Jordanian victories at [[Battles of Latrun (1948)|Latrun]], Israel began bombing targets in Arab cities. On the night of 31 May/1 June, the first Israeli raid on an Arab capital took place when three IAF planes flew to [[Amman]] and dropped several dozen 55 and 110-pound bombs, hitting the King's Palace and an adjacent British airfield. Some 12 people were killed and 30 wounded. During the attack, an RAF hangar was damaged, as were some British aircraft. The British threatened that in the event of another such attack, they would shoot down the attacking aircraft and bomb Israeli airfields, and as a result, Israeli aircraft did not attack Amman again for the rest of the war. Israel also bombed [[Arish]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Damascus]], and [[Cairo]]. Israeli [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers coming to Israel from [[Czechoslovakia]] bombed Egypt on their way to Israel.<ref>Morris, 2008, p. 262.</ref><ref>Aloni, 2001, pp. 7\u201311.</ref> According to [[Alan Dershowitz]], Israeli planes focused on bombing military targets in these attacks, though Benny Morris wrote that an 11 June air raid on [[Damascus]] was indiscriminate.\n\n==== Sea battles ====\n[[File:Northland Color 1.jpg|left|thumb|''Northland'' in [[Greenland]] ''circa'' 1944 which became the Israeli INS Eilat]]\nAt the outset of the war, the [[Israeli Navy]] consisted of three former [[Aliyah Bet]] ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in [[Haifa]] harbor, where they were tied up at the breakwater. Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background \u2013 one, the INS ''Eilat'', was an ex-[[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] icebreaker, and the other two, the INS ''Haganah'' and INS ''Wedgwood'', had been [[Royal Canadian Navy]] corvettes. The ships were put into minimum running condition by contractors dressed as stevedores and port personnel, who were able to work in the engine rooms and below deck. The work had to be clandestine to avoid arousing British suspicion. On 21 May 1948, the three ships set sail for Tel Aviv, and were made to look like ships that had been purchased by foreign owners for commercial use. In Tel Aviv, the ships were fitted with small field guns dating to the late 19th century and anti-aircraft guns. After the British left Haifa port on 30 June, Haifa became the main base of the Israeli Navy. In October 1948, a [[submarine chaser]] was purchased from the United States. The warships were manned by former merchant seamen, former crewmembers of Aliyah Bet ships, Israelis who had served in the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II, and foreign volunteers. The newly refurbished and crewed warships served on coastal patrol duties and bombarded Egyptian coastal installations in and around the [[Gaza City|Gaza]] area all the way to [[Port Said]].<ref name=\"navy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/machalnavy.html |title=History of the Navy |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref><ref>Gershoni, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\n==== End of the first phase ====\n[[File:Palestine Military Situation, June 11, 1948, Truman Papers.jpg|thumb|left|Palestine Military Situation, 11 June 1948. Truman Papers]]\nThroughout the following days, the Arabs were only able to make limited gains due to fierce Israeli resistance, and were quickly driven off their new holdings by Israeli counterattacks.\n\nAs the war progressed, the IDF managed to field more troops than the Arab forces. In July 1948, the IDF had 63,000 troops; by early spring 1949, they had 115,000. The Arab armies had an estimated 40,000 troops in July 1948, rising to 55,000 in October 1948, and slightly more by the spring of 1949.\n\nUpon the implementation of the truce, the IDF had control over nine Arab cities and towns or mixed cities and towns: New [[Jerusalem]], [[Jaffa]], [[Haifa]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Safed]], [[Tiberias]], [[Baysan]] (Beit She'an), [[Samakh, Tiberias|Samakh]] and [[Yibna]] ([[Yavne]]). Another city, [[Jenin]], was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, [[Mishmar HaYarden]], was in the territory of the proposed Jewish State according to [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Resolution 181]]. Within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, and in addition to them, the [[Lod Airport]] and pumping station near [[Antipatris]], which were within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, were under the control of the Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside of the boundaries of the proposed Jewish State and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometers of the proposed Jewish State were under the control of the Arab forces, while 700 square kilometers of the proposed Arab State were under the control of the IDF. This figure ignores the Negev desert which was not under any absolute control of either side.<ref name=statsgelber>Gelber, 2004, Kinneret, p.220</ref>\n\nIn the period between the invasion and the first truce the Syrian army had 315 of its men killed and 400\u2013500 injured; the Iraqi expeditionary force had 200 of its men killed and 500 injured; the Jordanian Arab Legion had 300 of its men killed and 400\u2013500 (including irregulars and Palesinian volunteers fighting under the Jordanians); the Egyptian army had 600 of its men killed and 1,400 injured (including irregulars from the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]); the ALA, which returned to fight in early June, had 100 of its men killed or injured. 800 Jews were taken hostage by the Arabs and 1,300 Arabs were taken hostage by the Jews, mostly Palestinians.<ref name=statsgelber/>\n\n===First truce: 11 June \u2013 8 July 1948===\nThe UN declared a truce on 29 May, which came into effect on 11 June and lasted 28 days.\nThe truce was designed to last 28 days and an arms embargo was declared with the intention that neither side would make any gains from the truce.

The main obstacles in his opinion were \"the Arab world's continued rejection of the existence of a Jewish state, whatever its borders; Israel's new 'philosophy', based on its increasing military strength, of ignoring the partition boundaries and conquering what additional territory it could; and the emerging Palestinian Arab refugee problem\".<ref name=\"Morris2008p269\" />\n\nTaking all the issues into account, Bernadotte presented a new partition plan. He proposed there be a Palestinian Arab state alongside Israel and that a \"Union\" \"be established between the two sovereign states of Israel and Jordan (which now included the West Bank); that the Negev, or part of it, be included in the Arab state and that Western Galilee, or part of it, be included in Israel; that the whole of Jerusalem be part of the Arab state, with the Jewish areas enjoying municipal autonomy and that Lydda Airport and Haifa be 'free ports' \u2013 presumably free of Israeli or Arab sovereignty\".<ref name=\"Morris2008p269\" /> Israel rejected the proposal, in particular the aspect of losing control of Jerusalem, but they did agree to extend the truce for another month.

The task of the 11th Brigades's 1st Battalion on the southern flank was to capture villages, and its operation ran smoothly, with but little resistance from local irregulars. According to Amnon Neumann, a [[Palmach]] veteran of the Southern front, hardly any Arab villages in the south fought back, due to the miserable poverty of their means and lack of weapons, and suffered expulsion.<ref>[[Gideon Levy]] and Alex Levac, [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/twilight-zone/1.550550 'Drafting the blueprint for Palestinian refugees' right of return,'] at [[Haaretz]] 4 October 2013: 'In all the Arab villages in the south almost nobody fought.

However, it was delayed by [[David Shaltiel]], possibly because he did not trust their ability after their failure to capture [[Deir Yassin]] without Haganah assistance.\n\nIrgun forces commanded by [[Yehuda Lapidot]] were to break through at the [[New Gate]], Lehi was to break through the wall stretching from the New Gate to the [[Jaffa Gate]], and the [[Etzioni Brigade|Beit Horon Battalion]] was to strike from [[Mount Zion]].\n\nThe battle was planned to begin on the [[Shabbat]], at 20:00 on 16 July, two days before the second ceasefire of the war. The plan went wrong from the beginning and was postponed first to 23:00 and then to midnight. It was not until 02:30 that the battle actually began. The Irgun managed to break through at the New Gate, but the other forces failed in their missions. At 05:45 on 17 July, Shaltiel ordered a retreat and to cease hostilities.\n\nOn 14 July 1948, Irgun occupied the Arab village of [[Malha]] after a fierce battle. Several hours later, the Arabs launched a counterattack, but Israeli reinforcements arrived, and the village was retaken at a cost of 17 dead.\n\n====Southern Galilee====\n{{Further|Operation Dekel}}\nThe second plan was [[Operation Dekel]], which was aimed at capturing the [[Lower Galilee]] including [[Nazareth]]. Nazareth was captured on 16 July, and by the time the second truce took effect at 19:00 18 July, the whole Lower Galilee from Haifa Bay to the [[Sea of Galilee]] was captured by Israel.\n\n====Eastern Galilee====\nOperation Brosh was launched in a failed attempt to dislodge Syrian forces from the Eastern Galilee and the Benot Yaakov Bridge. During the operation, 200 Syrians and 100 Israelis were killed. The [[Israeli Air Force]] also bombed [[Damascus]] for the first time.\n\n===Second truce: 18 July \u2013 15 October 1948===\n{{Further|Folke Bernadotte}}\nAt 19:00 on 18 July, the second truce of the conflict went into effect after intense diplomatic efforts by the UN.\n\nOn 16 September, Count [[Folke Bernadotte]] proposed a new partition for Palestine in which the [[Negev]] would be divided between Jordan and Egypt, and Jordan would annex [[Lod|Lydda]] and [[Ramla]]. There would be a Jewish state in the whole of [[Galilee]], with the frontier running from Faluja northeast towards Ramla and Lydda. [[Jerusalem]] would be internationalized, with municipal autonomy for the city's Jewish and Arab inhabitants, the [[Port of Haifa]] would be a free port, and [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Lydda Airport]] would be a free airport. All [[Palestinian refugee]]s would be granted the [[right of return]], and those who chose not to return would be compensated for lost property. The UN would control and regulate Jewish immigration.<ref name=\"Karsh2002p76\">{{harvnb|Karsh|2002|p=76}}</ref>\n\nThe plan was once again rejected by both sides. On the next day, 17 September, Bernadotte was [[Folke Bernadotte#Assassination|assassinated]] in Jerusalem by the militant Zionist group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]. A four-man team ambushed Bernadotte's motorcade in Jerusalem, killing him and a French UN observer sitting next to him. Lehi saw Bernadotte as a British and Arab puppet, and thus a serious threat to the emerging State of Israel, and feared that the provisional Israeli government would accept the plan, which it considered disastrous.

However, invading the West Bank might have brought into the borders of the expanding State of Israel a massive Arab population it could not absorb. The Negev desert was an empty space for expansion, so the main war effort shifted to Negev from early October.<ref>[[Shlomo Ben-Ami]] ([[#Ben-Ami|Shlomo Ben-Ami (2006)]], pp. 41\u201342)</ref> Israel decided to destroy or at least drive out the Egyptian expeditionary force since the Egyptian front lines were too vulnerable as permanent borders.<ref name=\"Morris2008p320\"/>\n\nOn 15 October, the IDF launched [[Operation Yoav]] in the northern Negev.<ref name=\"Karsh2002p64\" /> Its goal was to drive a wedge between the Egyptian forces along the coast and the [[Beersheba]]-[[Hebron]]-Jerusalem road and ultimately to conquer the whole Negev.<ref name=\"Karsh2002p64\" /> This was a special concern on the Israeli part because of a British diplomatic campaign to have the entire Negev handed over to Egypt and Jordan, and which thus made Ben-Gurion anxious to have Israeli forces in control of the Negev as soon as possible.<ref name=\"Karsh2002p64\" />\n\nOperation Yoav was headed by the Southern Front commander [[Yigal Allon]].

An Israeli sailor was killed and four wounded, and two of the ships were damaged. One Egyptian plane was shot down, but the corvette escaped. Israeli naval vessels also shelled Majdal on 17 October, and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] on 21 October, with air support from the [[Israeli Air Force]]. The same day, the IDF [[Battle of Beersheba (1948)|captured Beersheba]], and took 120 Egyptian soldiers prisoner.

The fort's Egyptian defenders had previously repulsed eight attempts to take it, including two during Operation Yoav. Israeli forces bombarded the fort before an assault with artillery and airstrikes by B-17 bombers. After breaching the outlying fences without resistance, the Israelis blew a hole in the fort's outer wall, prompting the 180 Egyptian soldiers manning the fort to surrender without a fight. The defeat prompted the Egyptians to evacuate several nearby positions, including hills the IDF had failed to take by force. Meanwhile, IDF forces took Iraq Suwaydan itself after a fierce battle, losing 6 dead and 14 wounded.\n\nFrom 5 to 7 December, the IDF conducted [[Operation Assaf]] to take control of the Western Negev. The main assaults were spearheaded by mechanized forces, while [[Golani Brigade]] infantry covered the rear. An Egyptian counterattack was repulsed. The Egyptians planned another counterattack, but it failed after Israeli aerial reconnaissance revealed Egyptian preparations, and the Israelis launched a preemptive strike. About 100 Egyptians were killed, and 5 tanks were destroyed, with the Israelis losing 5 killed and 30 wounded.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Operation Horev.jpg|thumb|right|An Israeli convoy in the Negev during Operation Horev]]\nOn 22 December, the IDF launched [[Operation Horev]] (also called Operation Ayin).<ref name=\"Karsh2002p68\" /> The goal of the operation was to drive all remaining Egyptian forces from the Negev, destroying the Egyptian threat on Israel's southern communities and forcing the Egyptians into a ceasefire.

The IDF captured Umm Katef and [[Abu Ageila]], and advanced north towards [[Arish|Al Arish]], with the goal of encircling the entire Egyptian expeditionary force. Israeli forces pulled out of the Sinai on 2 January 1949 following joint British-American pressure and a British threat of military action. IDF forces regrouped at the border with the [[Gaza Strip]]. Israeli forces attacked [[Battle of Rafah (1948)|Rafah]] the following day, and after several days of fighting, Egyptian forces in the Gaza Strip were surrounded.

The IDF entered and secured the territory, but did not meet significant resistance along the way, as the area was already designated to be part of the Jewish state in the UN Partition Plan, and the operation meant to establish Israeli sovereignty over the territory rather than actually conquer it.

RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside [[Egyptian Air Force|Royal Egyptian Air Force]] planes. High-flying British aircraft frequently flew over [[Haifa]] and [[Ramat David Airbase]], and became known to the Israelis as the \"shuftykeit.\"<ref name=\"spyflight\"/>\n\nOn 20 November 1948, an unarmed RAF photo-reconnaissance [[De Havilland Mosquito]] of [[No. 13 Squadron RAF]] was shot down by an [[Israeli Air Force]] [[P-51 Mustang]] flown by American volunteer Wayne Peake as it flew over the [[Galilee]] towards [[Hatzor Airbase]]. Peake opened fire with his cannons, causing a fire to break out in the port engine. The aircraft turned to sea and lowered its altitude, then exploded and crashed off [[Ashdod]].

The pilots had spotted smoking vehicles and were drawn to the scene out of curiosity. Two planes dived to below 500&nbsp;feet altitude to take pictures of the convoy, while the remaining two covered them from 1,500&nbsp;feet.<ref name=\"spyflight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spyflight.co.uk/iafvraf.htm|title=Iaf V Raf|publisher=Spyflight.co.uk|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Aloni\">Aloni, 2001, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIsraeli soldiers on the ground, alerted by the sound of the approaching Spitfires and fearing another Egyptian air attack, opened fire with machine guns. One Spitfire was shot down by a tank-mounted machine gun, while the other was lightly damaged and rapidly pulled up. The remaining three Spitfires were then attacked by patrolling IAF Spitfires flown by [[Chalmers Goodlin]] and John McElroy, volunteers from the United States and Canada respectively. All three Spitfires were shot down, and one pilot was killed.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=\"Aloni\"/>\n\nTwo pilots were captured by Israeli soldiers and taken to [[Tel Aviv]] for interrogation, and were later released. Another was rescued by [[Bedouin]]s and handed over to the Egyptian Army, which turned him over to the RAF. Later that day, four RAF Spitfires from the same squadron escorted by seven [[Hawker Tempest]]s from [[No. 213 Squadron RAF]] and eight from [[No. 6 Squadron RAF]] went searching for the lost planes, and were attacked by four IAF Spitfires. The Israeli formation was led by [[Ezer Weizman]]. The remaining three were manned by Weizman's wingman Alex Jacobs and American volunteers Bill Schroeder and Caesar Dangott.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=\"Aloni\"/> The Tempests found they could not jettison their external fuel tanks, and some had non-operational guns. Schroeder shot down a British Tempest, killing pilot David Tattersfield, and Weizman severely damaged a British plane flown by Douglas Liquorish. Weizman's plane and two other British aircraft also suffered light damage during the engagement. During the battle, British Tempest pilots treated British Spitfires as potential Israeli aircraft until the British Spitfire pilots were told by radio to wiggle their wings to be more clearly identifiable. The engagement ended when the Israelis realized the danger of their situation and disengaged, returning to Hatzor Airbase.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=\"Aloni\"/>\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] personally ordered the wrecks of the RAF fighters that had been shot down to be dragged into Israeli territory. Israeli troops subsequently visited the crash sites, removed various parts, and buried the other aircraft. However, the Israelis did not manage to conceal the wrecks in time to prevent British reconnaissance planes from photographing them. An RAF salvage team was deployed to recover the wrecks, entering Israeli territory during their search. Two were discovered inside Egypt, while Tattersfield's Tempest was found north of [[Nirim]], four miles inside Israel. Interviews with local Arabs confirmed that the Israelis had visited the crash sites to remove and bury the wrecks. Tattersfield was initially buried near the wreckage, but his body was later removed and reburied at the British War Cemetery in [[Ramla]].<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=cohen>Cohen, Michael Joseph: ''Truman and Israel'' (1990)</ref>\n\nIn response, the RAF readied all Tempests and Spitfires to attack any IAF aircraft they encountered and bomb IAF airfields. British troops in the Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. The [[Royal Navy]] was also placed on high alert. At Hatzor Airbase, the general consensus among the pilots, most of whom had flown with or alongside the RAF during World War II, was that the RAF would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots to go without retaliation, and would probably attack the base at dawn the next day. That night, in anticipation of an impending British attack, some pilots decided not to offer any resistance and left the base, while others prepared their Spitfires and were strapped into the cockpits at dawn, preparing to repel a retaliatory airstrike. However, despite pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, British commanders refused to authorize any retaliatory strikes.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref>Adrian, p. 7</ref>\n\nThe day following the incident, British pilots were issued a directive to regard any Israeli aircraft infiltrating Egyptian or Jordanian airspace as hostile and to shoot them down, but were also ordered to avoid activity close to Israel's borders. Later in January 1949, the British managed to prevent the delivery of aviation spirit and other essential fuels to Israel in retaliation for the incident. The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] presented the Israeli government with a demand for compensation over the loss of personnel and equipment.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref>Adrian, p. 59</ref>\n\n====UN Resolution 194====\nIn December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|Resolution 194]]. It called to establish a [[United Nations Conciliation Commission|UN Conciliation Commission]] to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states. However, many of the resolution's articles were not fulfilled, since these were opposed by Israel, rejected by the Arab states, or were overshadowed by war as the 1948 conflict continued.\n\n==Weapons==\nLargely leftover World War II era weapons were used by both sides.

The war's outcome had exacerbated Arab hostilities to local Jewish communities. News of the victory aroused messianic expectations in Libya and Yemen; Zionism had taken root in many countries; active incentives for making aliyah formed a key part of Israeli policy; and better economic prospects and security were to be expected from a Jewish state. Some Arab governments, Egypt, for example, held their Jewish communities hostage at times. Persecution, political instability, and news of a number of violent pogroms also played a role. Some 800,000\u20131,000,000 Jews eventually left the [[Arab world]] over the next three decades as a result of these various factors.<ref name=\"sachar_pp395-403\"/> Approximately 680,000 of them immigrated to Israel; the rest mostly settled in Europe (mainly France) or the Americas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/ |title=Vi- The Arab Refugees \u2013 Introduction |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=29 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117094828/http://mfa.gov.il/ |archivedate=17 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIsrael initially relied on [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]]-run tent camps known as [[Immigrant camps (Israel)|immigrant camps]] to accommodate displaced Jews from Europe and several Muslim-majority states. In the 1950s, these were transformed into [[Ma'abarot|transition camps]] (\"Ma'abarot\"), where living conditions were improved and tents were replaced with tin dwellings. Unlike the situation in the immigrant camps, when the Jewish Agency provided for immigrants, residents of the transition camps were required to provide for themselves. These camps began to decline in 1952, with the last one closing in 1963. The camps were largely transformed into permanent settlements known as [[development town]]s, while others were absorbed as neighborhoods of the towns they were attached to, and the residents were given permanent housing in these towns and neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=12939 |script-title=he:\u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea |publisher=Lib.cet.ac.il |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Transit Camps |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nMost development towns eventually grew into cities. Some Jewish immigrants were also given the vacant homes of Palestinian refugees.

British policies dissatisfied both Arabs and Jews. Arabs opposition developed into the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], while the Jewish resistance developed into the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine]] (1944\u20131947). In 1947, these on-going tensions erupted into [[1947\u20131948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] following the 29 November 1947 adoption of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], which planned to divide Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state, and the Special International Regime encompassing the cities of [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]].\n\nOn 15 May 1948, the civil war transformed into a conflict between Israel and the Arab states following the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] the previous day. Egypt, Transjordan, [[Syrian Republic (1946\u201363)|Syria]], and expeditionary forces from Iraq entered Palestine.<ref>David Tal, ''War in Palestine, 1948: Israeli and Arab Strategy and Diplomacy,'' p. 153.</ref> The invading forces took control of the Arab areas and immediately attacked Israeli forces and several Jewish settlements.<ref>Benny Morris (2008), p. 401.</ref><ref name=\"morris2008p236\"/><ref>Zeev Maoz, ''Defending the Holy Land'', University of Michigan Press, 2009 p. 4: 'A combined invasion of a Jordanian and Egyptian army started ...

Transjordan took control of the remainder of the former British mandate, which [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|it annexed]], and the Egyptian military [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|took control]] of the Gaza Strip. At the [[Jericho Conference]] on 1 December 1948, 2,000 Palestinian delegates called for unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity.<ref>Benvenisti, Meron (1996), ''City of Stone: The Hidden History of Jerusalem'', University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-20521-9}}. p. 27</ref> The conflict triggered significant demographic change throughout the Middle East. Around 700,000 Palestinian Arabs [[1948 Palestinian exodus|fled or were expelled]] from their homes in the area that became Israel, and they became [[Palestinian refugee]]s<ref name=\"refugees\" /> in what they refer to as Al-Nakba (\"the catastrophe\").

In Palestine, violence erupted almost immediately, feeding into a spiral of reprisals and counter-reprisals.

They consolidated their presence in [[Galilee]] and [[Samaria]].<ref name=\"Yoav Gelber 2006 pp.51-56\">[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 51\u201356</ref> [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] came from Egypt with several hundred men of the [[Army of the Holy War]].

By March, Al-Hussayni's tactic had paid off. Almost all of [[Haganah]]'s armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 p.163\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 163</ref> The situation for those who dwelt in the Jewish settlements in the highly isolated [[Negev]] and North of Galilee was even more critical.\n\nWhile the Jewish population had received strict orders requiring them to hold their ground everywhere at all costs,<ref name=\"Larry Collins 1971 p.163\">[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 163</ref> the Arab population was more affected by the general conditions of insecurity to which the country was exposed.

The British, on the other hand, decided on 7 February 1948, to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.<ref name=\"Henry Laurens 2005 p.83\">[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], p. 83</ref>\n\nAlthough a certain level of doubt took hold among Yishuv supporters, their apparent defeats were due more to their wait-and-see policy than to weakness. [[David Ben-Gurion]] reorganized Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training. Thanks to funds raised by [[Golda Meir]] from sympathisers in the United States, and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] decision to support the [[Zionism|Zionist]] cause, the Jewish representatives of Palestine were able to sign very important armament contracts in the East. Other Haganah agents recuperated stockpiles from the Second World War, which helped improve the army's equipment and logistics. [[Operation Balak]] allowed arms and other equipment to be transported for the first time by the end of March.[[File:PikiWiki Israel 21221 The Palmach.JPG|thumb|Palmach [[M4 Sherman]] tank leading a convoy.]]\n\nBen-Gurion invested [[Yigael Yadin]] with the responsibility to come up with a plan of offense whose timing was related to the foreseeable evacuation of British forces. This strategy, called Plan Dalet, was readied by March and implemented towards the end of April.<ref>David Tal, ''War in Palestine, 1948: Israeli and Arab Strategy and Diplomacy,'' Routledge 2004 p. 89.</ref> A separate plan, [[Operation Nachshon]], was devised to lift the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|siege of Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"morris2008p116\"/> 1500 men from Haganah's Givati brigade and [[Palmach]]'s Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between 5 and 20 April. Both sides acted offensively in defiance of the Partition Plan, which foresaw Jerusalem as a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]], under neither Jewish nor Arab jurisdiction. The Arabs did not accept the Plan, while the Jews were determined to oppose the internationalization of the city, and secure it as part of the Jewish state.<ref>David Tal, pp. 89\u201390.</ref> The operation was successful, and enough foodstuffs to last two months were trucked into Jerusalem for distribution to the Jewish population.<ref>[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 369\u201381</ref> The success of the operation was assisted by the death of al-Husayni in combat. During this time, and independently of Haganah or the framework of Plan Dalet, irregular fighters from [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] formations massacred a substantial number of Arabs at [[Deir Yassin massacre|Deir Yassin]], an event that, though publicly deplored and criticized by the principal Jewish authorities, had a deep impact on the morale of the Arab population and contributed to generate the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|exodus of the Arab population]].\n\nAt the same time, the first large-scale operation of the Arab Liberation Army ended in a debacle, having been roundly defeated at [[Mishmar HaEmek]],<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 pp.242-243\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 242\u201343</ref> coinciding with the loss of their [[Druze]] allies through defection.<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 p.242\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 242</ref>\n\nWithin the framework of the establishment of Jewish territorial continuity foreseen by Plan Dalet, the forces of Haganah, Palmach and Irgun intended to conquer mixed zones. The Palestinian Arab society was shaken. [[Tiberias]], [[Haifa]], [[Safed]], [[Beisan]], [[Jaffa]] and [[Acre (city)|Acre]] fell, resulting in the flight of more than 250,000 Palestinian Arabs.<ref>[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nThe British had, at that time, essentially withdrawn their troops. The situation pushed the leaders of the neighbouring Arab states to intervene, but their preparation was not finalized, and they could not assemble sufficient forces to turn the tide of the war. The majority of Palestinian Arab hopes lay with the [[Arab Legion]] of Transjordan's monarch, King Abdullah I, but he had no intention of creating a Palestinian Arab-run state, since he hoped to annex as much of the territory of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] as he could. He was playing a double-game, being just as much in contact with the Jewish authorities as with the Arab League.\n\nIn preparation for the offensive, Haganah successfully launched Operations [[Operation Yiftah|Yiftah]]<ref>[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 248\u201352</ref> and Ben-'Ami<ref name=\"Benny Morris 2003 pp.252\">[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 252\u201354</ref> to secure the Jewish settlements of [[Galilee]], and [[Operation Kilshon]], which created a united front around Jerusalem. The inconclusive meeting between [[Golda Meir]] and Abdullah I, followed by the [[Kfar Etzion massacre]] on 13 May by the Arab Legion led to predictions that the battle for Jerusalem would be merciless.\n\nOn 14 May 1948, [[David Ben-Gurion]] declared the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] and the [[1948 Palestine war]] entered its second phase with the intervention of the Arab state armies and the beginning of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War.\n\n===Armed forces===\nBy September 1947 the [[Haganah]] had \"10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine-guns, 672 two-inch mortars and 92 three-inch (76&nbsp;mm) mortars\".<ref name=\"morris_2003_16\"/>\n\n====Importing arms====\nIn 1946, Ben-Gurion decided that the Yishuv would probably have to defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and neighbouring Arab states and accordingly began a \"massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West\", and acquired many more during the first few months of hostilities. [[File:Avia S-199 in June 1948 (Israeli Air Force).png|thumb|An Israeli Avia S-199, in June 1948]]\n\nThe Yishuv managed to clandestinely amass arms and military equipment abroad for transfer to Palestine once the British blockade was lifted. In the [[United States]], Yishuv agents purchased three [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, one of which bombed Cairo in July 1948, some [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]] transport planes, and dozens of half-tracks, which were repainted and defined as \"agricultural equipment\". In Western Europe, [[Haganah]] agents amassed fifty 65mm French mountain guns, twelve 120mm mortars, ten [[Hotchkiss H35|H-35]] light tanks, and a large number of half-tracks. By mid-May or thereabouts the Yishuv had purchased from [[Czechoslovakia]] 25 [[Avia S-199]] fighters (an inferior version of the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]), 200 heavy machine guns, 5,021 light machine guns, 24,500 rifles, and 52 million rounds of ammunition, enough to equip all units, but short of heavy arms.<ref>Martin Van Creveld, ''Sword and the Olive: A Critical History of the Israeli Defense Force'', Public Affairs (1998) 2002 p. 78</ref> The airborne arms smuggling missions from [[Czechoslovakia]] were codenamed [[Operation Balak]].\n\nThe airborne smuggling missions were carried out by mostly American aviators \u2013 Jews and non-Jews \u2013 led by ex-U.S. Air Transport Command flight engineer [[Al Schwimmer]].\n\nSchwimmer's operation also included recruiting and training fighter pilots such as [[Lou Lenart]], commander of the first Israeli air assault against the Arabs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/vLinkTitle/WING+AND+A+PRAYER+A|title = A Wing and a Prayer|website = American Public Television}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY4OZRbdoRc|accessdate = 11 December 2015|title = A Wing and a Prayer}}</ref>\n\n====Arms production====\nThe Yishuv also had \"a relatively advanced ''arms producing'' capacity\", that between October 1947 and July 1948\" produced 3&nbsp;million 9&nbsp;mm bullets, 150,000 [[Mills bomb|Mills grenades]], 16,000 submachine guns ([[Sten]] Guns) and 210 three-inch (76&nbsp;mm) mortars\",<ref name=\"morris_2003_16\"/> along with a few \"[[Davidka]]\" mortars, which had been indigenously designed and produced. They were inaccurate but had a spectacularly loud explosion that demoralized the enemy. A large amount of the munitions used by the Israelis came from the [[Machon Ayalon|Ayalon Institute]], a clandestine bullet factory underneath kibbutz [[Ajalon|Ayalon]], which produced about 2.5 million bullets for Sten guns. The munitions produced by the Ayalon Institute were said to have been the only supply that was not in shortage during the war. Locally produced explosives were also plentiful. After Israel's independence, these clandestine arms manufacturing operations no longer had to be concealed, and were moved above ground. All of the Haganah's weapons-manufacturing was centralized and later became [[Israel Military Industries]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/remembrance-and-independence-2013/how-a-fake-kibbutz-was-built-to-hide-a-bullet-factory.premium-1.515584|title=How a Fake Kibbutz Was Built to Hide a Bullet Factory|first=Debra|last=Kamin|date=15 April 2013|newspaper=Haaretz}}</ref>\n\n====Manpower====\nIn November 1947, the Haganah was an underground paramilitary force that had existed as a highly organized, national force, since the Arab riots of [[1920 Palestine riots|1920]]\u2013[[Jaffa riots|21]], and throughout the [[Riots in Palestine of 1929|riots of 1929]], [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Great Uprising of 1936\u201339]],<ref name=\"morris_2003_16\">Morris, 2003, p. 16.</ref> and World War 2. It had a mobile force, the [[Hish (Haganah corps)|HISH]], which had 2,000 full-time fighters (men and women) and 10,000 reservists (all aged between 18 and 25) and an elite unit, the [[Palmach]] composed of 2,100 fighters and 1,000 reservists. The reservists trained three or four days a month{{Citation needed|reason=not true. where is the source?|date=November 2013}} and went back to civilian life the rest of the time. These mobile forces could rely on a garrison force, the HIM (''Heil Mishmar'', lit. Guard Corps), composed of people aged over 25. The Yishuv's total strength was around 35,000 with 15,000 to 18,000 fighters and a garrison force of roughly 20,000.<ref name=\"morris_2003_16\"/><ref>Gelber, p. 73; Karsh 2002, p. 25.</ref>\n\nThere were also several thousand men and women who had served in the British Army in World War II who did not serve in any of the underground militias but would provide valuable military experience during the war.<ref name=\"Karsh2002p25\">{{harvnb|Karsh|2002|p=25}}</ref> Walid Khalidi says the Yishuv had the additional forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, numbering some 12,000, the Gadna Youth Battalions, and the armed settlers.<ref name=\"Palestine1\">W.

With its fleet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/israel/iaftypes.htm|title=Israel Air Force Aircraft Types|date=19 September 1999|first=John|last=Hayles|publisher=John Hayles, aeroflight.co.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222090625/http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/israel/iaftypes.htm|archivedate=22 February 2007}}</ref> of light planes it was no match for Arab forces during the first few weeks of the war with their [[T-6 Texan|T-6s]], [[Spitfire]]s, [[C-47]]s, and [[Avro Anson]]s.\n\nOn 15 May, with the beginning of the war, four [[Royal Egyptian Air Force]] (REAF) Spitfires attacked [[Tel Aviv]], bombing [[Sde Dov Airport|Sde Dov Airfield]], where the bulk of Sherut Avir's aircraft were concentrated, as well as the [[Reading Power Station]]. Several aircraft were destroyed, some others were damaged, and five Israelis were killed. Throughout the following hours, additional waves of Egyptian aircraft bombed and strafed targets around Tel Aviv, although these raids had little effect. One Spitfire was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and its pilot was taken prisoner. Throughout the next six days, the REAF would continue to attack Tel Aviv, causing civilian casualties. On 18 May, Egyptian warplanes attacked the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]], killing 42 people and wounding 100. In addition to their attacks on Tel Aviv, the Egyptians also bombed rural settlements and airfields, though few casualties were caused in these raids.<ref>Morris (2008), p. 261</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the war, the REAF was able to attack Israel with near impunity, due to the lack of Israeli fighter aircraft to intercept them,<ref>Morris, 2008, p. 235</ref> and met only ground fire.\n\nAs more effective air defenses were transferred to Tel Aviv, the Egyptians began taking significant aircraft losses. As a result of these losses, as well as the loss of five Spitfires downed by the British when the Egyptians mistakenly attacked [[Ramat David Airbase|RAF Ramat David]], the Egyptian air attacks became less frequent. By the end of May 1948, almost the entire REAF Spitfire squadron based in [[El Arish]] had been lost, including many of its best pilots.\n\nAlthough lacking fighter or bomber aircraft, in the first few days of the war, Israel's embryonic air force still attacked Arab targets, with light aircraft being utilized as makeshift bombers, striking Arab encampments and columns. The raids were mostly carried out at night to avoid interception by Arab fighter aircraft. These attacks usually had little effect, except on morale.\n[[File:Avia-S-199-IAF-101Sqn-Tel-Nof-Israel-1948-01.jpg|thumb|Avia S-199 Israeli 1st fighter aircraft]]\n[[File:Spitfire-MkIX-hatzerim-1-2.jpg|thumb|Israeli Spitfire F Mk]]\n[[File:Israeli B-17Gs 01011953.JPG|thumb|upright|Israeli B-17s in flight]]\n\nThe balance of air power soon began to swing in favor of the Israeli Air Force following the arrival of 25 [[Avia S-199]]s from [[Czechoslovakia]], the first of which arrived in Israel on 20 May. Ironically, Israel was using the Avia S-199, an inferior derivative of the [[Bf 109]] designed in [[Nazi Germany]] to counter British-designed Spitfires flown by Egypt. Throughout the rest of the war, Israel would acquire more Avia fighters, as well as 62 Spitfires from Czechoslovakia. On 28 May 1948, Sherut Avir became the Israeli Air Force.\n\nMany of the pilots who fought for the Israeli Air Force were [[Mahal (Israel)|foreign volunteers]] or mercenaries, including many [[World War II]] veterans.\n\nOn 3 June, Israel scored its first victory in aerial combat when Israeli pilot [[Modi Alon]] shot down a pair of Egyptian DC-3s that had just bombed Tel Aviv. Although Tel Aviv would see additional raids by fighter aircraft, there would be no more raids by bombers for the rest of the war. From then on, the [[Israeli Air Force]] began engaging the Arab air forces in air-to-air combat. The first dogfight took place on 8 June, when an Israeli fighter plane flown by Gideon Lichtman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. By the fall of 1948, the IAF had achieved [[air superiority]] and had superior firepower and more knowledgeable personnel, many of whom had seen action in World War II.<ref>Morris, 2001, pp. 217\u201318.</ref> Israeli planes then began intercepting and engaging Arab aircraft on bombing missions.\n\nFollowing Israeli air attacks on Egyptian and Iraqi columns, the Egyptians repeatedly bombed [[Tel Nof Airbase|Ekron Airfield]], where IAF fighters were based. During a 30 May raid, bombs aimed for Ekron hit central [[Rehovot]], killing 7 civilians and wounding 30. In response to this, and probably to the Jordanian victories at [[Battles of Latrun (1948)|Latrun]], Israel began bombing targets in Arab cities. On the night of 31 May/1 June, the first Israeli raid on an Arab capital took place when three IAF planes flew to [[Amman]] and dropped several dozen 55 and 110-pound bombs, hitting the King's Palace and an adjacent British airfield. Some 12 people were killed and 30 wounded. During the attack, an RAF hangar was damaged, as were some British aircraft. The British threatened that in the event of another such attack, they would shoot down the attacking aircraft and bomb Israeli airfields, and as a result, Israeli aircraft did not attack Amman again for the rest of the war. Israel also bombed [[Arish]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Damascus]], and [[Cairo]]. Israeli [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers coming to Israel from [[Czechoslovakia]] bombed Egypt on their way to Israel.<ref>Morris, 2008, p. 262.</ref><ref>Aloni, 2001, pp. 7\u201311.</ref> According to [[Alan Dershowitz]], Israeli planes focused on bombing military targets in these attacks, though Benny Morris wrote that an 11 June air raid on [[Damascus]] was indiscriminate.\n\n==== Sea battles ====\n[[File:Northland Color 1.jpg|left|thumb|''Northland'' in [[Greenland]] ''circa'' 1944 which became the Israeli INS Eilat]]\nAt the outset of the war, the [[Israeli Navy]] consisted of three former [[Aliyah Bet]] ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in [[Haifa]] harbor, where they were tied up at the breakwater. Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background \u2013 one, the INS ''Eilat'', was an ex-[[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] icebreaker, and the other two, the INS ''Haganah'' and INS ''Wedgwood'', had been [[Royal Canadian Navy]] corvettes. The ships were put into minimum running condition by contractors dressed as stevedores and port personnel, who were able to work in the engine rooms and below deck. The work had to be clandestine to avoid arousing British suspicion. On 21 May 1948, the three ships set sail for Tel Aviv, and were made to look like ships that had been purchased by foreign owners for commercial use. In Tel Aviv, the ships were fitted with small field guns dating to the late 19th century and anti-aircraft guns. After the British left Haifa port on 30 June, Haifa became the main base of the Israeli Navy. In October 1948, a [[submarine chaser]] was purchased from the United States. The warships were manned by former merchant seamen, former crewmembers of Aliyah Bet ships, Israelis who had served in the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II, and foreign volunteers. The newly refurbished and crewed warships served on coastal patrol duties and bombarded Egyptian coastal installations in and around the [[Gaza City|Gaza]] area all the way to [[Port Said]].<ref name=\"navy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/machalnavy.html |title=History of the Navy |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref><ref>Gershoni, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\n==== End of the first phase ====\n[[File:Palestine Military Situation, June 11, 1948, Truman Papers.jpg|thumb|left|Palestine Military Situation, 11 June 1948. Truman Papers]]\nThroughout the following days, the Arabs were only able to make limited gains due to fierce Israeli resistance, and were quickly driven off their new holdings by Israeli counterattacks.\n\nAs the war progressed, the IDF managed to field more troops than the Arab forces. In July 1948, the IDF had 63,000 troops; by early spring 1949, they had 115,000. The Arab armies had an estimated 40,000 troops in July 1948, rising to 55,000 in October 1948, and slightly more by the spring of 1949.\n\nUpon the implementation of the truce, the IDF had control over nine Arab cities and towns or mixed cities and towns: New [[Jerusalem]], [[Jaffa]], [[Haifa]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Safed]], [[Tiberias]], [[Baysan]] (Beit She'an), [[Samakh, Tiberias|Samakh]] and [[Yibna]] ([[Yavne]]). Another city, [[Jenin]], was not occupied but its residents fled. The combined Arab forces captured 14 Jewish settlement points, but only one of them, [[Mishmar HaYarden]], was in the territory of the proposed Jewish State according to [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Resolution 181]]. Within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, there were twelve Arab villages which opposed Jewish control or were captured by the invading Arab armies, and in addition to them, the [[Lod Airport]] and pumping station near [[Antipatris]], which were within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state, were under the control of the Arabs. The IDF captured about 50 large Arab villages outside of the boundaries of the proposed Jewish State and a larger number of hamlets and Bedouin encampments. 350 square kilometers of the proposed Jewish State were under the control of the Arab forces, while 700 square kilometers of the proposed Arab State were under the control of the IDF. This figure ignores the Negev desert which was not under any absolute control of either side.<ref name=statsgelber>Gelber, 2004, Kinneret, p.220</ref>\n\nIn the period between the invasion and the first truce the Syrian army had 315 of its men killed and 400\u2013500 injured; the Iraqi expeditionary force had 200 of its men killed and 500 injured; the Jordanian Arab Legion had 300 of its men killed and 400\u2013500 (including irregulars and Palesinian volunteers fighting under the Jordanians); the Egyptian army had 600 of its men killed and 1,400 injured (including irregulars from the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]); the ALA, which returned to fight in early June, had 100 of its men killed or injured. 800 Jews were taken hostage by the Arabs and 1,300 Arabs were taken hostage by the Jews, mostly Palestinians.<ref name=statsgelber/>\n\n===First truce: 11 June \u2013 8 July 1948===\nThe UN declared a truce on 29 May, which came into effect on 11 June and lasted 28 days.\nThe truce was designed to last 28 days and an arms embargo was declared with the intention that neither side would make any gains from the truce.

The main obstacles in his opinion were \"the Arab world's continued rejection of the existence of a Jewish state, whatever its borders; Israel's new 'philosophy', based on its increasing military strength, of ignoring the partition boundaries and conquering what additional territory it could; and the emerging Palestinian Arab refugee problem\".<ref name=\"Morris2008p269\" />\n\nTaking all the issues into account, Bernadotte presented a new partition plan. He proposed there be a Palestinian Arab state alongside Israel and that a \"Union\" \"be established between the two sovereign states of Israel and Jordan (which now included the West Bank); that the Negev, or part of it, be included in the Arab state and that Western Galilee, or part of it, be included in Israel; that the whole of Jerusalem be part of the Arab state, with the Jewish areas enjoying municipal autonomy and that Lydda Airport and Haifa be 'free ports' \u2013 presumably free of Israeli or Arab sovereignty\".<ref name=\"Morris2008p269\" /> Israel rejected the proposal, in particular the aspect of losing control of Jerusalem, but they did agree to extend the truce for another month.

The task of the 11th Brigades's 1st Battalion on the southern flank was to capture villages, and its operation ran smoothly, with but little resistance from local irregulars.

An Israeli sailor was killed and four wounded, and two of the ships were damaged. One Egyptian plane was shot down, but the corvette escaped. Israeli naval vessels also shelled Majdal on 17 October, and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] on 21 October, with air support from the [[Israeli Air Force]].

The fort's Egyptian defenders had previously repulsed eight attempts to take it, including two during Operation Yoav. Israeli forces bombarded the fort before an assault with artillery and airstrikes by B-17 bombers. After breaching the outlying fences without resistance, the Israelis blew a hole in the fort's outer wall, prompting the 180 Egyptian soldiers manning the fort to surrender without a fight. The defeat prompted the Egyptians to evacuate several nearby positions, including hills the IDF had failed to take by force. Meanwhile, IDF forces took Iraq Suwaydan itself after a fierce battle, losing 6 dead and 14 wounded.\n\nFrom 5 to 7 December, the IDF conducted [[Operation Assaf]] to take control of the Western Negev. The main assaults were spearheaded by mechanized forces, while [[Golani Brigade]] infantry covered the rear. An Egyptian counterattack was repulsed. The Egyptians planned another counterattack, but it failed after Israeli aerial reconnaissance revealed Egyptian preparations, and the Israelis launched a preemptive strike. About 100 Egyptians were killed, and 5 tanks were destroyed, with the Israelis losing 5 killed and 30 wounded.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Operation Horev.jpg|thumb|right|An Israeli convoy in the Negev during Operation Horev]]\nOn 22 December, the IDF launched [[Operation Horev]] (also called Operation Ayin).<ref name=\"Karsh2002p68\" /> The goal of the operation was to drive all remaining Egyptian forces from the Negev, destroying the Egyptian threat on Israel's southern communities and forcing the Egyptians into a ceasefire.

Israeli forces pulled out of the Sinai on 2 January 1949 following joint British-American pressure and a British threat of military action. IDF forces regrouped at the border with the [[Gaza Strip]]. Israeli forces attacked [[Battle of Rafah (1948)|Rafah]] the following day, and after several days of fighting, Egyptian forces in the Gaza Strip were surrounded.

The IDF entered and secured the territory, but did not meet significant resistance along the way, as the area was already designated to be part of the Jewish state in the UN Partition Plan, and the operation meant to establish Israeli sovereignty over the territory rather than actually conquer it.

RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside [[Egyptian Air Force|Royal Egyptian Air Force]] planes. High-flying British aircraft frequently flew over [[Haifa]] and [[Ramat David Airbase]], and became known to the Israelis as the \"shuftykeit.\"<ref name=\"spyflight\"/>\n\nOn 20 November 1948, an unarmed RAF photo-reconnaissance [[De Havilland Mosquito]] of [[No. 13 Squadron RAF]] was shot down by an [[Israeli Air Force]] [[P-51 Mustang]] flown by American volunteer Wayne Peake as it flew over the [[Galilee]] towards [[Hatzor Airbase]]. Peake opened fire with his cannons, causing a fire to break out in the port engine. The aircraft turned to sea and lowered its altitude, then exploded and crashed off [[Ashdod]].

The pilots had spotted smoking vehicles and were drawn to the scene out of curiosity. Two planes dived to below 500&nbsp;feet altitude to take pictures of the convoy, while the remaining two covered them from 1,500&nbsp;feet.<ref name=\"spyflight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spyflight.co.uk/iafvraf.htm|title=Iaf V Raf|publisher=Spyflight.co.uk|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Aloni\">Aloni, 2001, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIsraeli soldiers on the ground, alerted by the sound of the approaching Spitfires and fearing another Egyptian air attack, opened fire with machine guns. One Spitfire was shot down by a tank-mounted machine gun, while the other was lightly damaged and rapidly pulled up. The remaining three Spitfires were then attacked by patrolling IAF Spitfires flown by [[Chalmers Goodlin]] and John McElroy, volunteers from the United States and Canada respectively. All three Spitfires were shot down, and one pilot was killed.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=\"Aloni\"/>\n\nTwo pilots were captured by Israeli soldiers and taken to [[Tel Aviv]] for interrogation, and were later released. Another was rescued by [[Bedouin]]s and handed over to the Egyptian Army, which turned him over to the RAF. Later that day, four RAF Spitfires from the same squadron escorted by seven [[Hawker Tempest]]s from [[No. 213 Squadron RAF]] and eight from [[No. 6 Squadron RAF]] went searching for the lost planes, and were attacked by four IAF Spitfires. The Israeli formation was led by [[Ezer Weizman]]. The remaining three were manned by Weizman's wingman Alex Jacobs and American volunteers Bill Schroeder and Caesar Dangott.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=\"Aloni\"/> The Tempests found they could not jettison their external fuel tanks, and some had non-operational guns. Schroeder shot down a British Tempest, killing pilot David Tattersfield, and Weizman severely damaged a British plane flown by Douglas Liquorish. Weizman's plane and two other British aircraft also suffered light damage during the engagement. During the battle, British Tempest pilots treated British Spitfires as potential Israeli aircraft until the British Spitfire pilots were told by radio to wiggle their wings to be more clearly identifiable. The engagement ended when the Israelis realized the danger of their situation and disengaged, returning to Hatzor Airbase.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=\"Aloni\"/>\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] personally ordered the wrecks of the RAF fighters that had been shot down to be dragged into Israeli territory. Israeli troops subsequently visited the crash sites, removed various parts, and buried the other aircraft. However, the Israelis did not manage to conceal the wrecks in time to prevent British reconnaissance planes from photographing them. An RAF salvage team was deployed to recover the wrecks, entering Israeli territory during their search. Two were discovered inside Egypt, while Tattersfield's Tempest was found north of [[Nirim]], four miles inside Israel. Interviews with local Arabs confirmed that the Israelis had visited the crash sites to remove and bury the wrecks. Tattersfield was initially buried near the wreckage, but his body was later removed and reburied at the British War Cemetery in [[Ramla]].<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref name=cohen>Cohen, Michael Joseph: ''Truman and Israel'' (1990)</ref>\n\nIn response, the RAF readied all Tempests and Spitfires to attack any IAF aircraft they encountered and bomb IAF airfields. British troops in the Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. The [[Royal Navy]] was also placed on high alert. At Hatzor Airbase, the general consensus among the pilots, most of whom had flown with or alongside the RAF during World War II, was that the RAF would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots to go without retaliation, and would probably attack the base at dawn the next day. That night, in anticipation of an impending British attack, some pilots decided not to offer any resistance and left the base, while others prepared their Spitfires and were strapped into the cockpits at dawn, preparing to repel a retaliatory airstrike. However, despite pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, British commanders refused to authorize any retaliatory strikes.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref>Adrian, p. 7</ref>\n\nThe day following the incident, British pilots were issued a directive to regard any Israeli aircraft infiltrating Egyptian or Jordanian airspace as hostile and to shoot them down, but were also ordered to avoid activity close to Israel's borders. Later in January 1949, the British managed to prevent the delivery of aviation spirit and other essential fuels to Israel in retaliation for the incident. The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] presented the Israeli government with a demand for compensation over the loss of personnel and equipment.<ref name=\"spyflight\"/><ref>Adrian, p. 59</ref>\n\n====UN Resolution 194====\nIn December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|Resolution 194]]. It called to establish a [[United Nations Conciliation Commission|UN Conciliation Commission]] to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states. However, many of the resolution's articles were not fulfilled, since these were opposed by Israel, rejected by the Arab states, or were overshadowed by war as the 1948 conflict continued.\n\n==Weapons==\nLargely leftover World War II era weapons were used by both sides.

Ben-Gurion refused, although he was aware that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest. He feared the reaction of Western powers and wanted to maintain good relations with the United States and not to provoke the British.

The war's outcome had exacerbated Arab hostilities to local Jewish communities. News of the victory aroused messianic expectations in Libya and Yemen; Zionism had taken root in many countries; active incentives for making aliyah formed a key part of Israeli policy; and better economic prospects and security were to be expected from a Jewish state. Some Arab governments, Egypt, for example, held their Jewish communities hostage at times. Persecution, political instability, and news of a number of violent pogroms also played a role. Some 800,000\u20131,000,000 Jews eventually left the [[Arab world]] over the next three decades as a result of these various factors.<ref name=\"sachar_pp395-403\"/> Approximately 680,000 of them immigrated to Israel; the rest mostly settled in Europe (mainly France) or the Americas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/ |title=Vi- The Arab Refugees \u2013 Introduction |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=29 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117094828/http://mfa.gov.il/ |archivedate=17 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIsrael initially relied on [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]]-run tent camps known as [[Immigrant camps (Israel)|immigrant camps]] to accommodate displaced Jews from Europe and several Muslim-majority states. In the 1950s, these were transformed into [[Ma'abarot|transition camps]] (\"Ma'abarot\"), where living conditions were improved and tents were replaced with tin dwellings. Unlike the situation in the immigrant camps, when the Jewish Agency provided for immigrants, residents of the transition camps were required to provide for themselves. These camps began to decline in 1952, with the last one closing in 1963. The camps were largely transformed into permanent settlements known as [[development town]]s, while others were absorbed as neighborhoods of the towns they were attached to, and the residents were given permanent housing in these towns and neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=12939 |script-title=he:\u05d4\u05de\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea |publisher=Lib.cet.ac.il |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Transit Camps |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nMost development towns eventually grew into cities.

He became a [[Canada|Canadian]] citizen. By the early 1960s he was studying [[Shotokan]] [[karate]]-Do at the headquarters of the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA) and studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[fishery|fisheries]] at [[Nihon University]].

In 1980 he won the Japan Broadcasting Writer's Award for a television drama written in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He continued to be an active [[environmentalist]] and lecture about the environment, addressing issues such as [[deforestation]] and the preservation of natural environments. He was particularly interested in restoring Japan's vast [[woodland]]s. The C. W.

His subjects included [[whaling]] (for which he went on a trip on a whaling vessel), the environment, martial arts and children's fiction. His books have been translated between English and Japanese, as well as into [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

W. Nicol was born in [[Neath]], [[Wales]] in July 1940.\n\nHe graduated from [[Tokyo University of Science]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1958 he visited the [[Arctic Circle]] to research [[eider duck]]. He became a [[Canada|Canadian]] citizen. By the early 1960s he was studying [[Shotokan]] [[karate]]-Do at the headquarters of the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA) and studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[fishery|fisheries]] at [[Nihon University]]. He spent 1967 to 1969 as a game warden in [[Ethiopia]], setting up the new [[Semien Mountains National Park]]. He returned to Japan, writing a book about his Ethiopian experiences entitled ''From the Roof of Africa'' (1971).\n\nSince taking up residence in Japan he wrote books and other literary works. In 1980 he won the Japan Broadcasting Writer's Award for a television drama written in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He continued to be an active [[environmentalist]] and lecture about the environment, addressing issues such as [[deforestation]] and the preservation of natural environments. He was particularly interested in restoring Japan's vast [[woodland]]s. The C. W. Nicol Afan Woodland in Kurohime, [[Shinano, Nagano|Shinano]]machi, Nagano Prefecture, was established in 1986.\n\nHe became a Japanese citizen (and thus lost his Canadian and British citizenship), which he wrote about in {{nihongo|''Why I became Japanese''|\u50d5\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u7406\u7531|Boku ga Nihonjin ni natta riy\u016b}}.\n\nHe wrote both fiction and non-fiction books, in both Japanese and in English. His subjects included [[whaling]] (for which he went on a trip on a whaling vessel), the environment, martial arts and children's fiction. His books have been translated between English and Japanese, as well as into [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In 2005, he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire]].\n\nC. W. Nicol was the chairman of the Afan Woodland Trust. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2016, and died aged 79.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2020/04/04/environment/c-w-nicol-uncompromising-environmentalist-possessed-deep-humanity/|title=C.W.
