It was also the site of the conflict that resulted in the court case ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'', and the film ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]'', which was based on it.

The community was named after Erwin Eveleth, a prominent employee of a timber company in the area. In 1895, iron ore was discovered beneath the village site and a post office was established.  In 1900, the village was moved to its present location. The village was incorporated as a city in 1902.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Van Brunt|first1=Walter|title=Duluth and St. Louis County|url=https://archive.org/details/duluthstlouiscou03vanb|date=1922|publisher=American Historical Society|location=Chicago}}</ref> When the city expanded, it annexed portions of [[Fayal Township, St. Louis County, Minnesota|Fayal Township]], including the former unincorporated communities of Alice Mine Station (in the Alice Location south of downtown) and Fayal. With further expansion, Eveleth annexed the unincorporated community of Genoa to its east. Eveleth first established its post office on February 9, 1895, with P. Ellard Dowling to act as commander-in-chief. Eveleth would also have its first paper, called ''The Eveleth Star'', the same year.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.45|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|6.29|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.16|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[Humid continental climate|Dfb]]\".

The town's economy has always been tied to the iron ore mining and processing which occurs in the area.  This economic activity peaked during [[World War II]] and declined through the second half of the twentieth century. A resurgence of demand for iron ore occurred in the 2005-7 timeframe. However, the local economies experienced only mild improvement due to improved mining productivity, which allowed demand to be met with only a modest increase in staffing levels.\n\nLocated within the city limits is the Thunderbird Mine, an iron ore mine producing crude ore processed into 5.5 million tons of iron ore \"[[taconite]]\" pellets per year. Opened in 1965 by Eveleth Taconite Company, a subsidiary of the [[Oglebay Norton Corporation|Oglebay-Norton]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor]] Companies. The mine is now (2010) operated by [[United Taconite]] LLC, a subsidiary of [[Cliffs Natural Resources]]. The ore is [[magnetite]]-bearing [[banded iron formation|iron formation]] of the Paleoproterozoic Biwabik Iron Formation. Ore is crushed at the mine site, and shipped by railroad to the Fairlane Plant in [[Forbes, MN]],<ref>[http://epa-sites.findthedata.org/l/331026/United-Taconite-Llc-Fairlane-Plant United Taconite Llc - Fairlane Plant - Forbes, MN - EPA Regulated Facility]</ref> for concentrating and pelletizing.\n\n==Arts and culture==\nEveleth at one time was one of a handful of U.S. cities with side-by-side [[water towers]] labeled \"HOT\" and \"COLD\".  Eveleth no longer has two such water towers.<ref>[http://www.ohiobarns.com/othersites/watertowers/mn/23-69hotcold.html Hot and Cold Water Towers]</ref>\n\nAn airplane carrying U.S. Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] and members of his family crashed into a dense forest about two miles from the Eveleth Airport on October 25, 2002.  Senator Wellstone and seven others died in the airplane crash. The crash occurred less than two weeks before Sen.

The city has long been noted as a powerhouse of [[hockey]] talent. They have won several state championships the latest being in 1998. During the 1950s the Eveleth Golden Bears dominated high school hockey in Minnesota, garnering a number of state records including most consecutive state championships (4: 1948\u201351), most consecutive championship games (5: 1948\u201352) and most consecutive tournament appearances (12: 1945\u201356) despite the district's tiny population.\n\n[[Frank Brimsek]] was born here in 1913. He was a Hockey Hall of Fame goalie.  Also born here were [[John Mariucci]] (in 1916) and [[John Mayasich]] (in 1933).  More recently, Eveleth produced [[Mark Pavelich]], who played on the 1980 U.S. [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team that memorably defeated the [[Soviet Union]] (depicted in the movie ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]'' about the [[Miracle on Ice]]) and [[Finland]] en route to a gold medal.

The community was named after Erwin Eveleth, a prominent employee of a timber company in the area. In 1895, iron ore was discovered beneath the village site and a post office was established.  In 1900, the village was moved to its present location. The village was incorporated as a city in 1902.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Van Brunt|first1=Walter|title=Duluth and St. Louis County|url=https://archive.org/details/duluthstlouiscou03vanb|date=1922|publisher=American Historical Society|location=Chicago}}</ref> When the city expanded, it annexed portions of [[Fayal Township, St. Louis County, Minnesota|Fayal Township]], including the former unincorporated communities of Alice Mine Station (in the Alice Location south of downtown) and Fayal. With further expansion, Eveleth annexed the unincorporated community of Genoa to its east. Eveleth first established its post office on February 9, 1895, with P. Ellard Dowling to act as commander-in-chief. Eveleth would also have its first paper, called ''The Eveleth Star'', the same year.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.45|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|6.29|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.16|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[Humid continental climate|Dfb]]\".

However, the local economies experienced only mild improvement due to improved mining productivity, which allowed demand to be met with only a modest increase in staffing levels.\n\nLocated within the city limits is the Thunderbird Mine, an iron ore mine producing crude ore processed into 5.5 million tons of iron ore \"[[taconite]]\" pellets per year. Opened in 1965 by Eveleth Taconite Company, a subsidiary of the [[Oglebay Norton Corporation|Oglebay-Norton]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor]] Companies. The mine is now (2010) operated by [[United Taconite]] LLC, a subsidiary of [[Cliffs Natural Resources]]. The ore is [[magnetite]]-bearing [[banded iron formation|iron formation]] of the Paleoproterozoic Biwabik Iron Formation. Ore is crushed at the mine site, and shipped by railroad to the Fairlane Plant in [[Forbes, MN]],<ref>[http://epa-sites.findthedata.org/l/331026/United-Taconite-Llc-Fairlane-Plant United Taconite Llc - Fairlane Plant - Forbes, MN - EPA Regulated Facility]</ref> for concentrating and pelletizing.\n\n==Arts and culture==\nEveleth at one time was one of a handful of U.S. cities with side-by-side [[water towers]] labeled \"HOT\" and \"COLD\".  Eveleth no longer has two such water towers.<ref>[http://www.ohiobarns.com/othersites/watertowers/mn/23-69hotcold.html Hot and Cold Water Towers]</ref>\n\nAn airplane carrying U.S. Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] and members of his family crashed into a dense forest about two miles from the Eveleth Airport on October 25, 2002.  Senator Wellstone and seven others died in the airplane crash. The crash occurred less than two weeks before Sen. Wellstone was to face re-election to the U.S. Senate.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/25/politics/25CND-CRASH.html</ref>\n\n===Hockey===\n[[Image:Worlds Second Largest Hockey Stick.jpg|thumb|right|World's largest authentic hockey stick in Eveleth]]\nThe [[United States Hockey Hall of Fame]] is located here (not to be confused with the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], in [[Toronto]]).  The city has long been noted as a powerhouse of [[hockey]] talent. They have won several state championships the latest being in 1998. During the 1950s the Eveleth Golden Bears dominated high school hockey in Minnesota, garnering a number of state records including most consecutive state championships (4: 1948\u201351), most consecutive championship games (5: 1948\u201352) and most consecutive tournament appearances (12: 1945\u201356) despite the district's tiny population.\n\n[[Frank Brimsek]] was born here in 1913. He was a Hockey Hall of Fame goalie.  Also born here were [[John Mariucci]] (in 1916) and [[John Mayasich]] (in 1933).  More recently, Eveleth produced [[Mark Pavelich]], who played on the 1980 U.S. [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team that memorably defeated the [[Soviet Union]] (depicted in the movie ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]'' about the [[Miracle on Ice]]) and [[Finland]] en route to a gold medal. Eveleth also has the\" world's largest authentic hockey stick\", standing at 107 feet and weighing 3 tons.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[George Abramson]], player in the National Football League.<ref>{{cite web | title = George Abramson | publisher = Sports Reference | url = https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AbraGe20.htm | accessdate = January 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Fred Agnich]] (1913\u20132004), Republican member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]], 1971-1987; businessman and rancher, native of Eveleth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utarl/00002/arl-00002.html|title=Fred J.
