A member of the amphibious [[List of Star Wars species (K\u2013O)#Mon Calamari|Mon Calamari]] species, Ackbar was the foremost military commander of the [[Rebel Alliance]], and led the attack against the [[Death Star#Second Death Star|second Death Star]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), the final entry in the [[Original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. Although his role in the film was brief, Ackbar became a prominent character in other ''Star Wars'' media, including novels, comic books, video games, and television shows, and later made appearances in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] films ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015) and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017), and the television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]''.\n\nWith his distinctive salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed head, and large fish-like eyes, Ackbar was realized in ''Return of the Jedi'' through the use of either a half-body puppet or full-body costume, depending on the camera angle required. In all three films he was portrayed by puppeteer [[Timothy D. Rose]], who originally played other characters, but requested to also play Ackbar after seeing his sculpt on a display stand. Ackbar was voiced by [[Erik Bauersfeld]], who made up the voice on the spot after looking at a photograph of Ackbar. Bauersfeld voiced the character in ''Return of the Jedi'' and ''The Force Awakens'', but died before the filming of ''The Last Jedi'', in which he was replaced by Tom Kane, who had voiced Ackbar in other works of ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nAckbar was originally planned to be more conventionally humanoid, but after ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] decided to make him an alien, he allowed ''Return of the Jedi'' director [[Richard Marquand]] to pick from various designs. Marquand picked a sketch by concept artist Nilo Rodis-Jamero, over the objections of other members of the film crew who thought the character looked too silly or ugly. Ackbar made his first appearance not in the film, but in a ''Star Wars'' newspaper comic strip that ran a few months before ''Return of the Jedi'' was released. Lucas was not entirely pleased with the final result of the character in the film and felt it was a compromise. Ackbar's first name, Gial, was not established until April 2012.\n\nAckbar had just 14 lines of dialogue in ''Return of the Jedi'', and his total screen time across all three film appearances totaled only three minutes and 30 seconds. Nevertheless, he is considered a fan favorite among ''Star Wars'' characters, and was ranked No. 16 in a 1998 list of the \"Top 20 ''Star Wars'' Characters\" in the magazine ''[[Star Wars Insider]]''. His line \"It's a trap!\" from ''Return of the Jedi'' became one of the most famous, quoted and beloved lines from the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, as well as a popular [[Internet meme]]. Several fans expressed disappointment and frustration with Ackbar's sudden death in ''The Last Jedi'', calling it abrupt and unceremonious, a sentiment echoed by Ackbar actors Rose and Kane, as well as the film's editor [[Bob Ducsay]].\n\n==Character biography==\n===Back story===\nAdmiral Ackbar was best known for his appearance in the film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', the final entry in the [[Original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. However, before the May 1983 debut of that film, the character made his first chronological appearance in a series of ''[[Star Wars]]'' newspaper [[comic strip]]s by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Al Williamson]].<ref name=\"McGranaghan0929\">{{cite web |last=McGranaghan |first=Mike |title=Star Wars: 15 Things You Didn't Know About Admiral Ackbar |website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=September 29, 2017 |url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-admiral-ackbar-trap-facts-trivia-secrets/ |accessdate=June 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605173731/https://screenrant.com/star-wars-admiral-ackbar-trap-facts-trivia-secrets/ |archive-date=June 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Databank\">{{cite web |title=Databank: Ackbar, Admiral |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/admiralackbar/index.html |accessdate=August 28, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805153425/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/admiralackbar/index.html |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"ONeill\">{{cite journal |last=O'Neill |first=Patrick Daniel | date=July 1987 |title=A Daily Dose of \"Star Wars\" |journal=[[Starlog]] |issue=120 |pages=36\u201337}}</ref> Published by the ''[[Los Angeles Times Syndicate]]'',<ref name=\"ONeill\" /> the strip was called ''Revenge of the Jedi'' after the original working title of ''Return of the Jedi'', and ran in newspapers across the United States from November 1982 to January 1983.<ref name=\"McGranaghan0929\" /> In the comic, Ackbar was portrayed as the leader of the [[List of Star Wars species (K\u2013O)#Mon Calamari|Mon Calamari]],<ref name=\"McGranaghan0929\" /><ref name=\"Databank\" /><ref name=\"Windham104\">{{Harvnb|Windham|Barr|Bray|Wallace|2015|p=104}}</ref> an alien species of fish-like, amphibious humanoids with salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed heads, and large fish-like eyes,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2011|p=80}}</ref><ref name=\"Chernoff62\">{{Harvnb|Chernoff|1999|p=62}}</ref> and who can breathe both on land and underwater.<ref name=\"Windham104\" /> They are allies of the [[Rebel Alliance]] in their [[Galactic Civil War|conflict]] with the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].<ref name=\"McGranaghan0929\" /><ref name=\"Databank\" /> In the comic, which is set just before the events of the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), Ackbar and his crew became stranded on the planet Daluuj after an Imperial attack, and they were rescued by [[Han Solo]], [[Luke Skywalker]], and [[Princess Leia|Princess Leia Organa]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' starship.<ref name=\"Sansweet9\">{{Harvnb|Sansweet|Hidalgo|2008a|p=9}}</ref> Ackbar demonstrated his tactical abilities by agitating water monsters in a ploy to get the sunken ''Falcon'' raised from a mud swamp.<ref name=\"McGranaghan0929\" />\n\nAckbar's back story was not explained in ''Return of the Jedi'', but has been established in ''Star Wars'' books and other media since the film was released.

He was more military. His costume looks hard.\"<ref name=\"Alinger215\" /> Costume designer Aggie Guerard Rodgers helped create the Ackbar costume, for which Rose wore a beanbag-like piece around his belly to create Ackbar's distinctive silhouette. Rose wore a white nylon jumpsuit over it, which had a pattern loosely based on ski jumpsuits used in costuming other background characters, as well as yellow striping down the side of the legs. The artificial fabric used on the jumpsuit made a distinct scratching sound whenever the actor walked, which Rodgers said was a nuisance for the film's sound crew.<ref name=\"Alinger215\" />\n\nOver the jumpsuit, Rose wore a vest made of white felt, along with a white plastic utility belt, a rank badge on the left side of his chest, and a large collar to accommodate the unique profile of Ackbar's head. The white boots Ackbar wears in the film are the same design as those worn by [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Imperial stormtroopers]]. A white helmet with an elongated back to accommodate Ackbar's large oval-shaped head was featured in original character sketches and was created for Ackbar. However, it created too many complications with the operation of the puppet head, so it was worn by another Mon Calamari character instead.<ref name=\"Alinger215\" /> Edwina Pellikka, a textile artist who handled the breakdown and aging of costumes in the film, said she was unhappy with the final result of Ackbar's costume. She later reflected that the all-white costume could have used more aging, saying: \"I had to airbrush it, which was done very fast and it does look kind of like it's outlined.

A member of the amphibious [[List of Star Wars species (K\u2013O)#Mon Calamari|Mon Calamari]] species, Ackbar was the foremost military commander of the [[Rebel Alliance]], and led the attack against the [[Death Star#Second Death Star|second Death Star]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), the final entry in the [[Original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. Although his role in the film was brief, Ackbar became a prominent character in other ''Star Wars'' media, including novels, comic books, video games, and television shows, and later made appearances in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] films ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015) and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017), and the television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]''.\n\nWith his distinctive salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed head, and large fish-like eyes, Ackbar was realized in ''Return of the Jedi'' through the use of either a half-body puppet or full-body costume, depending on the camera angle required. In all three films he was portrayed by puppeteer [[Timothy D. Rose]], who originally played other characters, but requested to also play Ackbar after seeing his sculpt on a display stand. Ackbar was voiced by [[Erik Bauersfeld]], who made up the voice on the spot after looking at a photograph of Ackbar. Bauersfeld voiced the character in ''Return of the Jedi'' and ''The Force Awakens'', but died before the filming of ''The Last Jedi'', in which he was replaced by Tom Kane, who had voiced Ackbar in other works of ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nAckbar was originally planned to be more conventionally humanoid, but after ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] decided to make him an alien, he allowed ''Return of the Jedi'' director [[Richard Marquand]] to pick from various designs. Marquand picked a sketch by concept artist Nilo Rodis-Jamero, over the objections of other members of the film crew who thought the character looked too silly or ugly. Ackbar made his first appearance not in the film, but in a ''Star Wars'' newspaper comic strip that ran a few months before ''Return of the Jedi'' was released. Lucas was not entirely pleased with the final result of the character in the film and felt it was a compromise. Ackbar's first name, Gial, was not established until April 2012.\n\nAckbar had just 14 lines of dialogue in ''Return of the Jedi'', and his total screen time across all three film appearances totaled only three minutes and 30 seconds. Nevertheless, he is considered a fan favorite among ''Star Wars'' characters, and was ranked No. 16 in a 1998 list of the \"Top 20 ''Star Wars'' Characters\" in the magazine ''[[Star Wars Insider]]''. His line \"It's a trap!\" from ''Return of the Jedi'' became one of the most famous, quoted and beloved lines from the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, as well as a popular [[Internet meme]]. Several fans expressed disappointment and frustration with Ackbar's sudden death in ''The Last Jedi'', calling it abrupt and unceremonious, a sentiment echoed by Ackbar actors Rose and Kane, as well as the film's editor [[Bob Ducsay]].\n\n==Character biography==\n===Back story===\nAdmiral Ackbar was best known for his appearance in the film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', the final entry in the [[Original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].

He was more military. His costume looks hard.\"<ref name=\"Alinger215\" /> Costume designer Aggie Guerard Rodgers helped create the Ackbar costume, for which Rose wore a beanbag-like piece around his belly to create Ackbar's distinctive silhouette. Rose wore a white nylon jumpsuit over it, which had a pattern loosely based on ski jumpsuits used in costuming other background characters, as well as yellow striping down the side of the legs. The artificial fabric used on the jumpsuit made a distinct scratching sound whenever the actor walked, which Rodgers said was a nuisance for the film's sound crew.<ref name=\"Alinger215\" />\n\nOver the jumpsuit, Rose wore a vest made of white felt, along with a white plastic utility belt, a rank badge on the left side of his chest, and a large collar to accommodate the unique profile of Ackbar's head. The white boots Ackbar wears in the film are the same design as those worn by [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Imperial stormtroopers]]. A white helmet with an elongated back to accommodate Ackbar's large oval-shaped head was featured in original character sketches and was created for Ackbar. However, it created too many complications with the operation of the puppet head, so it was worn by another Mon Calamari character instead.<ref name=\"Alinger215\" /> Edwina Pellikka, a textile artist who handled the breakdown and aging of costumes in the film, said she was unhappy with the final result of Ackbar's costume.
