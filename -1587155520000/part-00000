It was specified by [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] telecommunications administrations ([[Postal Telephone and Telegraph|PTT]]s) and opened for service on 1 October 1981 as a response to the increasing congestion and heavy requirements of the manual mobile phone networks: [[Autoradiopuhelin|ARP]] (150&nbsp;M[[Hertz|Hz]]) in Finland, [[MTD (mobile network)|MTD]] (450&nbsp;MHz) in Sweden and Denmark, and [[Offentlig Landmobil Telefoni|OLT]] in Norway.\n\nNMT is based on [[analog (signal)|analogue]] technology (first generation or [[1G]]) and two variants exist: '''NMT-450''' and '''NMT-900'''. The numbers indicate the frequency bands used. '''NMT-900''' was introduced in 1986 and carries more channels than the older '''NMT-450''' network.\n\nThe NMT specifications were free and open, allowing many companies to produce NMT hardware and pushing prices down. The success of NMT was important to [[Nokia]] (then Mobira) and [[Ericsson]]. First Danish implementers were Storno (then owned by [[General Electric]], later taken over by [[Motorola]]) and AP (later taken over by [[Philips]]). Initial NMT phones were designed to mount in the trunk of a car, with a keyboard/display unit at the driver's seat. \"Portable\" versions existed, though they were still bulky, and with battery life still being a big problem. Later models such as [[Benefon]]'s were as small as {{convert|100|mm|abbr=in}} and weighed only about 100&nbsp;grams.\nUIRXDGRTUIASNHUI RFUIBNWUIOZXD\n\n== History ==\n\nThe NMT network was opened in Sweden and Norway in 1981, and in Denmark and Finland in 1982. Iceland joined in 1986. However, Ericsson introduced the first commercial service in Saudi Arabia on 1 September 1981 to 1,200 users, as a pilot test project, one month before they did the same in Sweden. By 1985 the network had grown to 110,000 subscribers in [[Scandinavia]] and Finland, 63,300 in Norway alone, which made it the world's largest mobile network at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nordsveen|first=Arve M|title=Mobiltelefonens historie i Norge|url=http://telemuseum.no/mambo/content/view/29/1/|publisher=Norsk Telemuseum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213045903/http://telemuseum.no/mambo/content/view/29/1/|archivedate=13 February 2007|language=Norwegian|date=28 November 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe NMT network has mainly been used in the Nordic countries, [[Baltic countries]], Switzerland, Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Turkey, Croatia, Bosnia, Russia, Ukraine and in Asia. The introduction of digital mobile networks such as [[GSM]] has reduced the popularity of NMT and the Nordic countries have suspended their NMT networks. In Estonia the NMT network was shut down in December 2000. In Finland [[TeliaSonera]]'s NMT network was suspended on 31 December 2002. Norway's last NMT network was suspended on 31 December 2004. Sweden's [[TeliaSonera]] NMT network was suspended on 31 December 2007. The NMT network (450&nbsp;MHz) however has one big advantage over GSM which is the range; this advantage is valuable in big but sparsely populated countries such as Iceland. In Iceland, the GSM network reaches 98% of the country's population but only a small proportion of its land area. The NMT system however reaches most of the country and a lot of the surrounding waters, thus the network was popular with fishermen and those traveling in the vast empty mainland. In Iceland the NMT service was stopped on 1 September 2010, when [[S\u00edminn]] closed down its NMT network.\n\nIn Denmark, Norway and [[Sweden]] the NMT-450 frequencies have been auctioned off to Swedish [[Nordisk Mobiltelefon (Sweden)|Nordisk Mobiltelefon]] which later became '''Ice.net''' and renamed to [[Nordisk Mobiltelefon (Sweden)|Net 1]] that built a digital network using CDMA 450. During 2015, the network has been migrated to 4G.\nPermission for [[TeliaSonera]] to continue operation of the NMT-450 frequencies ended on 31 December 2007.\n\nIn Russia Uralwestcom shut down their NMT network on 1 September 2006 and Sibirtelecom on 10 January 2008.\nSkylink, subsidiary company of TELE2 Russia operates NMT-450 network as of 2016 in [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] and [[Perm Krai]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160206091401/http://skylink.ru/perm/main/plans/arhiv/oblastnoy-statsionarnyy__fl__nmt.html \u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439-\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 (\u0424\u041b)_NMT]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://skylink.ru/perm/main/plans/arhiv/oblastnoy-statsionarnyy__yul__nmt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206105941/http://skylink.ru/perm/main/plans/arhiv/oblastnoy-statsionarnyy__yul__nmt.html |archive-date=6 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These networks are used in sparsely populated areas with long distance.

With smaller ranges the network can service more simultaneous callers; for example in a city the range can be kept short for better service. NMT used full duplex transmission, allowing for simultaneous receiving and transmission of voice. Car phone versions of NMT used transmission power of up to 15&nbsp;watt (NMT-450) and 6&nbsp;watt (NMT-900), handsets up to 1&nbsp;watt. NMT had automatic switching (dialing) and [[handover]] of the call built into the standard from the beginning, which was not the case with most preceding car phone services, such as the Finnish [[Autoradiopuhelin|ARP]]. Additionally, the NMT standard specified billing as well as national and international [[roaming]].\n\n=== Signaling ===\nNMT voice channel is transmitted with FM-modulation<ref name=\"googlebooks-tele-illustrated\">{{cite book|title=The telecommunications illustrated dictionary|author=Petersen, Julie K.|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2mMzS0hCkAC&pg=PA679&lpg=PA679#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=CRC Press}}</ref> and NMT signaling transfer speeds vary between 600 and 1,200&nbsp;bits per second, using FFSK (Fast [[Frequency Shift Keying]]) modulation. Signaling between the base station and the mobile station was implemented using the same RF channel that was used for audio, and using the 1,200&nbsp;bit/s FFSK modem. This caused the periodic short noise bursts, e.g. during handover, that were uniquely characteristic to NMT sound.\n\n=== Security ===\nA disadvantage of the original NMT specification is that voice traffic was not [[Encryption|encrypted]], therefore it was possible to listen to calls using e.g. a [[scanner (radio)|scanner]]. As a result, some scanners have had the NMT bands blocked so they could not be accessed. Later versions of the NMT specifications defined optional analog [[scrambler|scrambling]] which was based on two-band audio frequency [[Voice inversion|inversion]]. If both the base station and the mobile station supported scrambling, they could agree upon using it when initiating a phone call. Also, if two users had mobile (phone) stations supporting scrambling, they could turn it on during conversation even if the base stations didn't support it. In this case, audio would be scrambled all the way between the 2 mobile stations. While the scrambling method was not at all as strong as encryption of current digital phones, such as [[GSM]] or [[CDMA]], it did prevent casual listening with scanners. Scrambling is defined in NMT Doc 450-1: System Description (1999-03-23) and NMT Doc 450-3 and 900-3: Technical Specification for the Mobile Station (1995-10-04)'s Annex 26 v.1.1: Mobile Station with Speech Scrambling \u2013 Split Inversion Method (Optional) (1998-01-27).\n\n=== Data transfer ===\nNMT also supported a simple but robust integrated data transfer mode called DMS (Data and Messaging Service) or NMT-Text, which used the network's signaling channel for data transfer. Using DMS, text messaging was also possible between two NMT handsets before SMS service started in GSM, but this feature was never commercially available except in Russian, Polish and Bulgarian NMT networks. Another data transfer method was called NMT Mobidigi with transfer speeds of 380&nbsp;bits per second. It required external equipment.\n\n=== List of NMT operators ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Operator\n! Country\n! Technology\n!

{"title_page": "Lexer hack", "text_new": "In [[computer programming]], the '''lexer hack''' is a common solution to the problems in [[parsing]] [[ANSI C]], due to the reference grammar being [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]]. In C, classifying a sequence of characters as a variable name or a type name requires contextual information of the phrase structure, which prevents one from having a context-free [[lexical analysis|lexer]].\n\n== Problem ==\nThe problem is that in the following code, the lexical class of <code>A</code> cannot be determined without further contextual information:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n(A)*B\n</source>\nThis code could be multiplication of two variables, in which case <code>A</code> is a variable; written unambiguously:\n<source lang=\"C\">\nA * B\n</source>\nAlternatively, it could be casting the dereferenced value of <code>B</code> to the type <code>A</code>, in which case <code>A</code> is a typedef name; written unambiguously:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n(A) (*B)\n</source>\n\nIn more detail, in a [[compiler]], the lexer performs one of the earliest stages of converting the [[source code]] to a program. It scans the text to extract meaningful ''tokens'', such as words, numbers, and strings. The parser analyzes sequences of tokens attempting to match them to syntax rules representing language structures, such as loops and variable declarations. A problem occurs here if a single sequence of tokens can ambiguously match more than one syntax rule.\n\nThis ambiguity can happen in C if the lexer does not distinguish between variable and [[typedef]] identifiers.<ref name=\"Roskind 91\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/mso/goofie/grammar5.txt |author=Roskind, James A. |date=1991-07-11 |title=A YACC-able C++ 2.1 GRAMMAR, AND THE RESULTING AMBIGUITIES |access-date=2008-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622120718/http://www.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/mso/goofie/grammar5.txt |archive-date=2007-06-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For example, in the C expression:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\n(A) * B\n</source>\n\nthe lexer may find these tokens:\n\n# left parenthesis\n# identifier 'A'\n# right parenthesis\n# operator '*'\n# identifier 'B'\nThe problem is precisely that the lexical class of ''A'' cannot be determined without further context: the parser can interpret this as variable ''A'' multiplied by ''B'' or as type ''A'' casting the dereferenced value of ''B''. This is known as the \"typedef-name: identifier\" problem, due to the name of the problematic [[production (computer science)|production rule]].<ref name=\"Bendersky 07\">{{cite web | url=http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/11/24/the-context-sensitivity-of-cs-grammar/ | title=The context sensitivity of C's grammar | author=Bendersky, Eli | date=2007-11-24}}</ref>\n\n== The hack solution ==\n\nThe solution generally consists of feeding information from the semantic [[symbol table]] back into the lexer. That is, rather than functioning as a pure one-way [[Pipeline (software)|pipeline]] from the lexer to the parser, there is a [[return channel|backchannel]] from semantic analysis back to the lexer. This mixing of parsing and semantic analysis is generally regarded as inelegant, which is why it is called a \"hack\".\n\nWithout added context, the lexer cannot distinguish type identifiers from other identifiers because all identifiers have the same format.

In C, classifying a sequence of characters as a variable name or a type name requires contextual information of the phrase structure, which prevents one from having a context-free [[lexical analysis|lexer]].\n\n== Problem ==\nThe problem is that in the following code, the lexical class of <code>A</code> cannot be determined without further contextual information:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n(A)*B\n</source>\nThis code could be multiplication of two variables, in which case <code>A</code> is a variable; written unambiguously:\n<source lang=\"C\">\nA * B\n</source>\nAlternatively, it could be casting the dereferenced value of <code>B</code> to the type <code>A</code>, in which case <code>A</code> is a typedef name; written unambiguously:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n(A) (*B)\n</source>\n\nIn more detail, in a [[compiler]], the lexer performs one of the earliest stages of converting the [[source code]] to a program. It scans the text to extract meaningful ''tokens'', such as words, numbers, and strings. The parser analyzes sequences of tokens attempting to match them to syntax rules representing language structures, such as loops and variable declarations. A problem occurs here if a single sequence of tokens can ambiguously match more than one syntax rule.\n\nThis ambiguity can happen in C if the lexer does not distinguish between variable and [[typedef]] identifiers.<ref name=\"Roskind 91\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/mso/goofie/grammar5.txt |author=Roskind, James A. |date=1991-07-11 |title=A YACC-able C++ 2.1 GRAMMAR, AND THE RESULTING AMBIGUITIES |access-date=2008-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622120718/http://www.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/mso/goofie/grammar5.txt |archive-date=2007-06-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For example, in the C expression:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\n(A) * B\n</source>\n\nthe lexer may find these tokens:\n\n# left parenthesis\n# identifier 'A'\n# right parenthesis\n# operator '*'\n# identifier 'B'\nThe problem is precisely that the lexical class of ''A'' cannot be determined without further context: the parser can interpret this as variable ''A'' multiplied by ''B'' or as type ''A'' casting the dereferenced value of ''B''.

That is, rather than functioning as a pure one-way [[Pipeline (software)|pipeline]] from the lexer to the parser, there is a [[return channel|backchannel]] from semantic analysis back to the lexer. This mixing of parsing and semantic analysis is generally regarded as inelegant, which is why it is called a \"hack\".\n\nWithout added context, the lexer cannot distinguish type identifiers from other identifiers because all identifiers have the same format.

On the surface of a topological insulator there are special states that fall within the bulk energy gap and allow surface metallic conduction. Carriers in these surface states have their [[Spin quantum number|spin]] locked at a right-angle to their momentum (spin-momentum locking). At a given energy the only other available electronic states have different spin, so the [[Umklapp scattering|\"U\"-turn scattering]] is strongly suppressed and conduction on the surface is highly metallic. Non-interacting topological insulators are characterized by an index (known as <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> topological invariants) similar to the [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] in topology.<ref name=KM/>\n\nAs long as time-reversal symmetry is preserved (i.e., there is no magnetism), the <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> index cannot change by small perturbations and the conducting states at the surface are symmetry-protected. On the other hand, in the presence of magnetic impurities, the surface states will generically become insulating. Nevertheless, if certain crystalline symmetries like inversion are present, the <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> index is still well defined.

MBE is performed in [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] or [[ultra-high vacuum]], the elements are heated in different electron beam evaporators until they [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublime]]. The gaseous elements then condense on the wafer where they react with each other to form [[single crystal]]s.\n\nMBE is an appropriate technique for the growth of high quality single-crystal films.  In order to avoid a huge [[Lattice constant#Lattice matching|lattice mismatch]] and [[Crystallographic defect|defects]] at the interface, the substrate and thin film are expected to have similar lattice constants.  MBE has an advantage over other methods due to the fact that the synthesis is performed in high vacuum hence resulting in less contamination.  Additionally,  lattice defect is reduced due to the ability to influence the growth rate and the ratio of species of source materials present at the substrate interface.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Heremans|first=Joseph P.|last2=Cava|first2=Robert J.|last3=Samarth|first3=Nitin|date=2017-09-05|title=Tetradymites as thermoelectrics and topological insulators|journal=Nature Reviews Materials|language=En|volume=2|issue=10|pages=17049|doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2017.49|issn=2058-8437|bibcode=2017NatRM...217049H}}</ref> Furthermore,  in MBE,  samples can be grown layer by layer which results in flat surfaces with smooth interface for engineered heterostructures.

MBE is performed in [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] or [[ultra-high vacuum]], the elements are heated in different electron beam evaporators until they [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublime]]. The gaseous elements then condense on the wafer where they react with each other to form [[single crystal]]s.\n\nMBE is an appropriate technique for the growth of high quality single-crystal films.  In order to avoid a huge [[Lattice constant#Lattice matching|lattice mismatch]] and [[Crystallographic defect|defects]] at the interface, the substrate and thin film are expected to have similar lattice constants.  MBE has an advantage over other methods due to the fact that the synthesis is performed in high vacuum hence resulting in less contamination.  Additionally,  lattice defect is reduced due to the ability to influence the growth rate and the ratio of species of source materials present at the substrate interface.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Heremans|first=Joseph P.|last2=Cava|first2=Robert J.|last3=Samarth|first3=Nitin|date=2017-09-05|title=Tetradymites as thermoelectrics and topological insulators|journal=Nature Reviews Materials|language=En|volume=2|issue=10|pages=17049|doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2017.49|issn=2058-8437|bibcode=2017NatRM...217049H}}</ref> Furthermore,  in MBE,  samples can be grown layer by layer which results in flat surfaces with smooth interface for engineered heterostructures.
