The first scientifically documented plesiosaur fossils were discovered during the early [[:Category:19th century in paleontology|19th century]] by [[Mary Anning]].<ref name=\"ellis-intro-3\" /> Plesiosaurs were actually discovered and described before [[dinosaurs]].<ref name=\"ellis-overview-20\" /> They were also among the first animals to be featured in [[Paleoart|artistic reconstructions]] of the ancient world, and therefore among the earliest prehistoric creatures to attract the attention of the lay public.<ref name=\"ellis-overview-21\" /> Plesiosaurs were originally thought to be a kind of primitive transitional form between marine life and terrestrial [[reptiles]]. However, now plesiosaurs are recognized as highly derived marine reptiles descended from terrestrial ancestors.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-118\" />\n\nEarly researchers thought that plesiosaurs laid [[egg (biology)|egg]]s like most reptiles. They commonly imagined plesiosaurs crawling up beaches and burying eggs like [[turtles]]. However, later opinion shifted towards the idea that plesiosaurs gave live birth and never went on dry land.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-119\" /> Plesiosaur locomotion has been a source of continuous controversy among paleontologists.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-136\" /> The earliest speculations on the subject during the 19th century saw plesiosaur swimming as analogous to the paddling of modern [[sea turtles]]. During the 1920s opinion shifted to the idea that plesiosaurs swam with a [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]] motion.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-137\" /> However, a paper published in 1975 that once more found support for sea turtle-like swimming in plesiosaurs.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-138\" /> This conclusion reignited the controversy regarding plesiosaur locomotion through the late 20th century.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-139\" /> In 2011, [[F. Robin O'Keefe]] and [[Luis M. Chiappe]] concluded the debate on plesiosaur reproduction, reporting the discovery of a gravid female plesiosaur with a single large embryo preserved inside her.<ref name=\"okeefe-chiappe-pregnant-870\" />\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Prescientific==\n{{Main|Adrienne Mayor}}\nAssociated remains of plesiosaurs and animals like the diving [[bird]] ''[[Hesperornis]]'' or the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Pteranodon]]'' may have inspired legends about conflict between [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunder Birds]] and Water Monsters told by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[Paleontology in Kansas|Kansas]] and [[Paleontology in Nebraska|Nebraska]].<ref name=\"mayor-bone-cheyenne-178-211\" />\n\n==18th century==\n'''[[1719 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C\">1719</span>]]'''{{anchor|1719}}\n*[[William Stukeley]] described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur, brought to his attention by the great-grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], [[Robert Darwin of Elston]].<ref name=\"stukeley\" />\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Conybeare Plesiosaur 1824.jpg|thumb|right|1824 skeletal reconstruction of ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'' by [[Henry De la Beche]]]]\n[[File:Duria Antiquior.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', the first artistic restoration of a Mesozoic ecosystem, features a ''Plesiosaurus'' being preyed upon by an ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'']]\n\n===1810s===\n'''[[1811 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C\">1811</span>]]'''{{anchor|1811}}\n* [[Mary Anning]] discovered some plesiosaur fossils in [[England]].<ref name=\"ellis-intro-3\" />\n\n===1820s===\n'''[[1821 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C\">1821</span>]]'''{{anchor|1821}}\n* [[Henry De la Beche]] and [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] are the first to name a plesiosaurian species: ''[[Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus]]''.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-123\" />\n\n'''[[1822 in paleontology|<span style=\"color:#14145C\">1822</span>]]'''{{anchor|1822}}\n\n* Parkinson coined the name ''[[Plesiosaurus priscus]]'' for some of the remains used by de la Beche and Conybeare as the basis for ''Plesiosaurus''.

The first scientifically documented plesiosaur fossils were discovered during the early [[:Category:19th century in paleontology|19th century]] by [[Mary Anning]].<ref name=\"ellis-intro-3\" /> Plesiosaurs were actually discovered and described before [[dinosaurs]].<ref name=\"ellis-overview-20\" /> They were also among the first animals to be featured in [[Paleoart|artistic reconstructions]] of the ancient world, and therefore among the earliest prehistoric creatures to attract the attention of the lay public.<ref name=\"ellis-overview-21\" /> Plesiosaurs were originally thought to be a kind of primitive transitional form between marine life and terrestrial [[reptiles]]. However, now plesiosaurs are recognized as highly derived marine reptiles descended from terrestrial ancestors.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-118\" />\n\nEarly researchers thought that plesiosaurs laid [[egg (biology)|egg]]s like most reptiles. They commonly imagined plesiosaurs crawling up beaches and burying eggs like [[turtles]]. However, later opinion shifted towards the idea that plesiosaurs gave live birth and never went on dry land.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-119\" /> Plesiosaur locomotion has been a source of continuous controversy among paleontologists.<ref name=\"ellis-plesiosaurs-136\" /> The earliest speculations on the subject during the 19th century saw plesiosaur swimming as analogous to the paddling of modern [[sea turtles]].

In \"Worlds of Music\", Jeff Todd Titon suggests that a number of organizational elements may determine the formal structure of a piece of music, such as \"the arrangement of musical units of rhythm, melody, and or/ harmony that show repetition or variation, the arrangement of the instruments (as in the order of solos in a jazz or bluegrass performance), or the way a symphonic piece is orchestrated\", among other factors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Worlds of music : an introduction to the music of the world's peoples|last=Titon|first=Jeff Todd|publisher=Schirmer Cengage Learning|others=Cooley, Timothy J.|year=2009|isbn=978-0534595395|edition= 5th|location=Belmont, CA|pages=|oclc=214315557}}</ref>\n\nThese organizational elements may be broken into smaller units called '''phrases,''' which express a musical idea but lack sufficient weight to stand alone.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Musical form and analysis : time, pattern, proportion|last=Spring|first=Glenn|publisher=|others=Hutcheson, Jere.|year=2013|isbn=978-1478607229|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=|oclc=882602291}}</ref> Musical form unfolds over time through the expansion and development of these ideas.\n\n==Labeling procedures==\nTo aid in the process of describing form, musicians have developed a simple system of labeling musical units with letters. In his textbook \"Listening to Music,\" professor [[Craig M. Wright|Craig Wright]] writes,\n\n{{Quote| text=The first statement of a musical idea is designated '''A.''' Subsequent contrasting sections are labeled '''B, C, D,''' and so on. If the first or any other musical unit returns in varied form, then that variation is indicated by a superscript number-- '''A<sup>1</sup>''' and '''B<sup>2</sup>,''' for example. Subdivisions of each large musical unit are shown by lowercase letters ('''a, b,''' and so on).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Listening to music|last=M.|first=Wright, Craig|date=2014|publisher=Schirmer/Cengage Learning|isbn=9781133954729|edition= 7th|location=Boston, MA|oclc=800033147}}</ref>}}\n\nSome writers also use a prime label (such as '''B'''', pronounced \"'''B prime'''\", or  '''B'''<nowiki>''</nowiki>, pronounced \"'''B double prime'''\") to denote sections that are closely related, but vary slightly.\n\n==Levels of organization==\nThe founding level of musical form can be divided into two parts: \n* The arrangement of the [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] into [[Accent (music)|unaccented]] and accented [[Beat (music)|beats]], the [[Cell (music)|cells]] of a [[bar (music)|measure]] that, when [[Harmony (music)|harmonized]], may give rise to a [[Motif (music)|motif]] or [[Figure (music)|figure]].\n* The further organization of such a measure, by repetition and [[Variation (music)|variation]], into a true musical '''phrase''' having a definite rhythm and duration that may be implied in melody and harmony, defined, for example, by a long final note and a breathing space. This \"phrase\" may be regarded as the fundamental unit of musical form: it may be broken down into measures of two or three beats, but its distinctive nature will then be lost. Even at this level, the importance of the principles of repetition and contrast, weak and strong, climax and repose, can be seen.<ref name=\"Macpherson\">{{cite book|last=Macpherson |first=Stewart |authorlink=Stewart Macpherson |title=Form in Music |edition=  New and Revised |year= 1930 |publisher= Joseph Williams |location=London |isbn= |chapter=Form}}</ref> (''See also:'' [[Meter (music)]]) Thus, form may be understood on three levels of organization. For the purpose of this exposition, these levels can be roughly designated as ''passage'', ''piece'', and ''cycle''.\n\n===Passage===\nThe smallest level of construction concerns the way musical phrases are organized into musical [[sentence (music)|sentences]] and \"paragraphs\" such as the [[Verse (music)|verse]] of a song. This may be compared to, and is often decided by, the [[verse form]] or meter of the words or the steps of a dance.\n\nFor example, the [[twelve bar blues]] is a specific verse form, while [[common meter]] is found in many hymns and ballads and, again, the Elizabethan [[galliard]], like many dances, requires a certain rhythm, pace and length of melody to fit its repeating pattern of steps. Simpler styles of music may be more or less wholly defined at this level of form, which therefore does not differ greatly from the loose sense first mentioned and which may carry with it rhythmic, harmonic, timbral, occasional and melodic conventions.\n\n===Piece (or movement) ===\nThe next level concerns the entire structure of any single self-contained [[musical piece]] or movement. If the hymn, ballad, blues or dance alluded to above simply repeats the same musical material indefinitely then the piece is said to be in [[strophic form]] overall.

It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a \"development\" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]].

An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]]\u2014a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music.

It may have an introduction at the beginning.\n\nThen, the exposition is the first required section. It lays out the thematic material in its basic version. There are usually two themes or theme groups in the exposition, and they are often in contrast styles and keys and connected by a transition. In the end of the exposition, there is a closing theme which concludes the section.\n\nThe exposition is followed by the development section in which the material in the exposition is developed.\n\nAfter the development section, there is a returning section called recapitulation where the thematic material returns in the tonic key.\n\nAt the end of the movement, there might be a coda, after the recapitulation.<ref name=\"The Sonata Allegro Form\"/>\n\n== Forms used in Western popular music ==\nSome forms are used predominantly within popular music, including genre-specific forms. Popular music forms are often derived from strophic form (AAA song form), 32-bar form (AABA song form), verse-chorus form (AB song form) and 12-bar blues form (AAB song form).<ref name= \"Songstuff\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.songstuff.com/song-writing/article/song-form-overview/|title=A Guide To Song Forms \u2013 Song Form Overview|website=Songstuff}}</ref>\n\n===Sectional forms===\n\n* AABA a.k.a.

In \"Worlds of Music\", Jeff Todd Titon suggests that a number of organizational elements may determine the formal structure of a piece of music, such as \"the arrangement of musical units of rhythm, melody, and or/ harmony that show repetition or variation, the arrangement of the instruments (as in the order of solos in a jazz or bluegrass performance), or the way a symphonic piece is orchestrated\", among other factors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Worlds of music : an introduction to the music of the world's peoples|last=Titon|first=Jeff Todd|publisher=Schirmer Cengage Learning|others=Cooley, Timothy J.|year=2009|isbn=978-0534595395|edition= 5th|location=Belmont, CA|pages=|oclc=214315557}}</ref>\n\nThese organizational elements may be broken into smaller units called '''phrases,''' which express a musical idea but lack sufficient weight to stand alone.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Musical form and analysis : time, pattern, proportion|last=Spring|first=Glenn|publisher=|others=Hutcheson, Jere.|year=2013|isbn=978-1478607229|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=|oclc=882602291}}</ref> Musical form unfolds over time through the expansion and development of these ideas.\n\n==Labeling procedures==\nTo aid in the process of describing form, musicians have developed a simple system of labeling musical units with letters. In his textbook \"Listening to Music,\" professor [[Craig M. Wright|Craig Wright]] writes,\n\n{{Quote| text=The first statement of a musical idea is designated '''A.''' Subsequent contrasting sections are labeled '''B, C, D,''' and so on. If the first or any other musical unit returns in varied form, then that variation is indicated by a superscript number-- '''A<sup>1</sup>''' and '''B<sup>2</sup>,''' for example. Subdivisions of each large musical unit are shown by lowercase letters ('''a, b,''' and so on).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Listening to music|last=M.|first=Wright, Craig|date=2014|publisher=Schirmer/Cengage Learning|isbn=9781133954729|edition= 7th|location=Boston, MA|oclc=800033147}}</ref>}}\n\nSome writers also use a prime label (such as '''B'''', pronounced \"'''B prime'''\", or  '''B'''<nowiki>''</nowiki>, pronounced \"'''B double prime'''\") to denote sections that are closely related, but vary slightly.\n\n==Levels of organization==\nThe founding level of musical form can be divided into two parts: \n* The arrangement of the [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] into [[Accent (music)|unaccented]] and accented [[Beat (music)|beats]], the [[Cell (music)|cells]] of a [[bar (music)|measure]] that, when [[Harmony (music)|harmonized]], may give rise to a [[Motif (music)|motif]] or [[Figure (music)|figure]].\n* The further organization of such a measure, by repetition and [[Variation (music)|variation]], into a true musical '''phrase''' having a definite rhythm and duration that may be implied in melody and harmony, defined, for example, by a long final note and a breathing space. This \"phrase\" may be regarded as the fundamental unit of musical form: it may be broken down into measures of two or three beats, but its distinctive nature will then be lost. Even at this level, the importance of the principles of repetition and contrast, weak and strong, climax and repose, can be seen.<ref name=\"Macpherson\">{{cite book|last=Macpherson |first=Stewart |authorlink=Stewart Macpherson |title=Form in Music |edition=  New and Revised |year= 1930 |publisher= Joseph Williams |location=London |isbn= |chapter=Form}}</ref> (''See also:'' [[Meter (music)]]) Thus, form may be understood on three levels of organization. For the purpose of this exposition, these levels can be roughly designated as ''passage'', ''piece'', and ''cycle''.\n\n===Passage===\nThe smallest level of construction concerns the way musical phrases are organized into musical [[sentence (music)|sentences]] and \"paragraphs\" such as the [[Verse (music)|verse]] of a song. This may be compared to, and is often decided by, the [[verse form]] or meter of the words or the steps of a dance.\n\nFor example, the [[twelve bar blues]] is a specific verse form, while [[common meter]] is found in many hymns and ballads and, again, the Elizabethan [[galliard]], like many dances, requires a certain rhythm, pace and length of melody to fit its repeating pattern of steps. Simpler styles of music may be more or less wholly defined at this level of form, which therefore does not differ greatly from the loose sense first mentioned and which may carry with it rhythmic, harmonic, timbral, occasional and melodic conventions.\n\n===Piece (or movement) ===\nThe next level concerns the entire structure of any single self-contained [[musical piece]] or movement. If the hymn, ballad, blues or dance alluded to above simply repeats the same musical material indefinitely then the piece is said to be in [[strophic form]] overall. If it repeats with distinct, sustained changes each time, for instance in setting, ornamentation or instrumentation, then the piece is a [[theme and variations]]. If two distinctly different themes are alternated indefinitely, as in a song alternating verse and [[Refrain|chorus]] or in the alternating slow and fast sections of the Hungarian [[czardas]], then this gives rise to a simple binary form. If the theme is played (perhaps twice), then a new theme is introduced, the piece then closing with a return to the first theme, we have a simple ternary form.\n\nGreat arguments and misunderstanding can be generated by such terms as 'ternary' and 'binary', as a complex piece may have elements of both at different organizational levels.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} A [[minuet]], like any Baroque dance, generally had simple binary structure ('''AABB'''), however, this was frequently extended by the introduction of another minuet arranged for solo instruments (called the ''trio''), after which the first was repeated again and the piece ended\u2014this is a ternary form\u2014'''ABA''': the piece is binary on the lower compositional level but ternary on the higher. Organisational levels are not clearly and universally defined in western musicology, while words like \"section\" and \"passage\" are used at different levels by different scholars whose definitions, as Schlanker{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} points out, cannot keep pace with the myriad innovations and variations devised by musicians.\n\n===Cycle===\nThe grandest level of organization may be referred to as \"[[#Cyclical forms|cyclical form]]\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} It concerns the arrangement of several self-contained pieces into a large-scale composition. For example, a set of songs with a related theme may be presented as a [[song-cycle]], whereas a set of [[Baroque dance]]s were presented as a [[Suite (music)|suite]]. The [[opera]] and [[ballet]] may organize song and dance into even larger forms. The symphony, generally considered to be one piece, nevertheless divides into multiple movements (which can usually work as a self-contained piece if played alone).  This level of musical form, though it again applies and gives rise to different genres, takes more account of the methods of musical organisation used.

(AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A<sup>1</sup>ab<sup>1</sup>+coda).\n\nThe Sonata Form is \"the most important principle of musical form, or formal type from the classical period well into the twentieth century.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0195170672|location=|pages=}}</ref> It is usually used as the form of the first movement in multi-movement works.

It may have an introduction at the beginning.\n\nThen, the exposition is the first required section. It lays out the thematic material in its basic version. There are usually two themes or theme groups in the exposition, and they are often in contrast styles and keys and connected by a transition. In the end of the exposition, there is a closing theme which concludes the section.\n\nThe exposition is followed by the development section in which the material in the exposition is developed.\n\nAfter the development section, there is a returning section called recapitulation where the thematic material returns in the tonic key.\n\nAt the end of the movement, there might be a coda, after the recapitulation.<ref name=\"The Sonata Allegro Form\"/>\n\n== Forms used in Western popular music ==\nSome forms are used predominantly within popular music, including genre-specific forms. Popular music forms are often derived from strophic form (AAA song form), 32-bar form (AABA song form), verse-chorus form (AB song form) and 12-bar blues form (AAB song form).<ref name= \"Songstuff\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.songstuff.com/song-writing/article/song-form-overview/|title=A Guide To Song Forms \u2013 Song Form Overview|website=Songstuff}}</ref>\n\n===Sectional forms===\n\n* AABA a.k.a.

The [[oratorio]] took shape in the second half of the 16th century as a narrative recounted\u2014rather than acted\u2014by the singers.{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}<!--What exactly does this statement have to do with musical form?-->\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Developing variation]]\n* [[List of musical forms by era]]\n* [[Song structure]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Chester|1970}}|reference=Chester, Andrew. 1970. \"Second Thoughts on a Rock Aesthetic: The Band\".

These dolls, representing the lowest price-range (less than US$75), are usually made of welded [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] and bear only a passing resemblance to actual people.  They have an artificial and typically crudely designed vagina or [[Human penis|penis]], but due to their affordability many users are willing to overlook their shortcomings. They often burst at the seams after a few uses, although they are commonly given as [[gag gift]]s and therefore many may not be used at all. In Russia for some years the Bubble Baba Challenge humorously featured participants river rafting on blowup dolls as a matter of entertainment but in 2013 the race was cancelled on \"health and safety\" grounds.<ref>{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.bubblebabachallenge.ru | website = bubblebabachallenge.ru | publisher = The Bubble Baba Challenge }}</ref>\n\nAt the middle market price-range ($100 to approximately $1,000), dolls are made of thicker vinyl or heavy [[latex]] without welded seams or a polyurethane and silicone mixture, typically surrounding a foam core.  Most have plastic [[mannequin]]-style heads and styled wigs, plastic or glass eyes, and occasionally properly moulded hands and feet. Some vinyl dolls can contain water-filled body areas such as the [[breasts]] or [[buttocks]]. Latex dolls were made in Hungary, China and France but only the French manufacturer Domax now remains in production. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe manufacturing process causes most latex dolls to be delivered with a fine coating of [[zinc oxide]] covering the skin, which is usually removed by the consumer by placing the doll under the [[shower]]. Otherwise, latex is an inert and non-toxic natural material; although a small percentage of users may discover a [[latex allergy]].\n\nThe most expensive sex dolls (approximately $1,200 and up) are usually made from [[silicone]] (usually above $3,000 at 2016 prices) or [[thermoplastic elastomer]] known as TPE (below $3,000). Dolls made of either material can be very lifelike, with faces and bodies modeled on real people in some instances, with realistic skin material (similar to that used for movie special effects), and with realistic (or even real) [[hair]]. These dolls usually have an articulated [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or metal [[skeleton]] with flexible joints that allows them to be positioned in a variety of positions for display and for sexual acts. Silicone or TPE dolls are much heavier than vinyl or latex inflatable ones (which consist mostly of air), but are roughly half the weight of a real human being of comparable size.\n\nBecause of their ability to be posed in different positions silicone dolls are popular with artists and photographers as models.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interview with Stacy Leigh | url = http://www.acclaimmag.com/arts/interview-stacy-leigh-nsfw/ | work = Acclaim Mag}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Home page | url = http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412131418/http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2008-04-12 | publisher = Doll Story (French outlet of Japanese dolls) | quote = These silicone dolls are sold to passionate clients, but also to sculptors, painters and even photographers }} Links to examples of photographic work.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, sex dolls are known as {{nihongo|\"Dutch wives\"|[[:ja:\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5|\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5]]|datchi waifu}}, which now refers to relatively inexpensive dolls.

The market has grown for two main reasons. Firstly, the last twenty years have seen huge improvements over earlier types of sex dolls, and customers come to realize this through using the web. Secondly, the method of retail purchase has also improved, now showing customers what the actual doll, seams, hair, and even orifices look like.\n\nIn China the market has mushroomed on account of the demographic effects of the one child policy and accordingly numerous new Chinese manufacturers have appeared in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jiang | first = Quanbao | title = The predicament of bare branches' sexuality | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality]] | volume = 15 | publisher = [[Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]] | date = September 18, 2012 | url = http://www.ejhs.org/volume15/Bare.html | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n== Non-standard forms ==\nIn Japan one can purchase inflatable love pillows  or \"[[dakimakura]]\" that are printed with a life-size picture of a porn star or anime character. Other less common novelty love dolls include overweight, intersex, elderly and alien dolls, which are usable for pleasure but also tend to be given as gag gifts. Some inflatable dolls even have the form of children.\n\nSome companies manufacture cloth sex dolls using the same technology that is used to create plush toys. With widespread cultural use of the internet amongst younger generations, numerous forums exist for amateurs who create their own sex dolls from fabric or other materials. There are even mailing lists for discussing techniques and experiences with ''MLDs'' (material love dolls) {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.\n\nSome inflatable sex dolls are made in the form of animals, most notably [[sheep]] and cows. These dolls are more of a joke gift or party novelty, and are often not suitable for sexual use{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}.\n\n== New materials and technologies ==\nSilicone dolls were at first made from tin-cure silicone but platinum technology has better longevity, less prone to tears and compression marks. For this reason the \"[[RealDoll]]\" manufacturer reported switching from the tin to the platinum material in June 2009<ref>[https://www.documentarystorm.com/guys-and-dolls/ Guys and Dolls Documentary] DocumentaryStorm.com. Retrieved 22 February 2019.</ref> and all other manufacturers have followed suit.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nSince 2012 or so a [[thermoplastic elastomer]] alternative known as TPE has come into common use particularly by Chinese manufacturers which has enabled realistic dolls to be made which are cheaper than those composed of the high quality expensive [[platinum cure silicone]].<ref>[https://dollview.com/silicone-vs-tpe/ DollView.com.

Both this company and the company \"First Androids\" once offered pelvic thruster motor, audio capability and heated orifices, though these options are no longer available. Several modern doll manufacturers now offer the last option on their silicone dolls, with the addition of an internal heating system.\n\n==Legal restrictions==\nThe importation of sex dolls for men has been banned in [[Botswana]] according to Section 178 of the Botswana Penal Code.

Although sex dolls originally started appearing in Austria around 1980, they gained popularity in 2017 when a brothel started offering sex doll services to clients.<ref>[http://sexclubwien.com/breaking-news/brothel-vienna-started-using-sex-dolls/ Brothel Vienna started using sex dolls]</ref> This can be contributed to the fact that the dolls have become more realistic in recent years.\n\nIn addition to being able to have intercourse with the sex doll, some places allow clients to purchase sex dolls for themselves. One of the biggest laufhauses in [[Vienna]] offers sex in the [[laufhaus]] with dolls alongside real women.\n\nAccording to brothel owners who offer sex dolls, the dolls are being properly cleaned after every session. Unprotected sex with sex dolls is also allowed, but it is not advised as there is no guarantee that the dolls are being cleaned after each client.<ref>[http://brothelvienna.info/articles/sex-doll-brothels-becoming-more-popular/ Sex doll brothels becoming more popular]</ref>\n\n=== South Korea ===\nIn 2019 the South Korean Supreme Court ruled to legalize the sale of sex dolls.

They often burst at the seams after a few uses, although they are commonly given as [[gag gift]]s and therefore many may not be used at all. In Russia for some years the Bubble Baba Challenge humorously featured participants river rafting on blowup dolls as a matter of entertainment but in 2013 the race was cancelled on \"health and safety\" grounds.<ref>{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.bubblebabachallenge.ru | website = bubblebabachallenge.ru | publisher = The Bubble Baba Challenge }}</ref>\n\nAt the middle market price-range ($100 to approximately $1,000), dolls are made of thicker vinyl or heavy [[latex]] without welded seams or a polyurethane and silicone mixture, typically surrounding a foam core.  Most have plastic [[mannequin]]-style heads and styled wigs, plastic or glass eyes, and occasionally properly moulded hands and feet. Some vinyl dolls can contain water-filled body areas such as the [[breasts]] or [[buttocks]]. Latex dolls were made in Hungary, China and France but only the French manufacturer Domax now remains in production. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe manufacturing process causes most latex dolls to be delivered with a fine coating of [[zinc oxide]] covering the skin, which is usually removed by the consumer by placing the doll under the [[shower]]. Otherwise, latex is an inert and non-toxic natural material; although a small percentage of users may discover a [[latex allergy]].\n\nThe most expensive sex dolls (approximately $1,200 and up) are usually made from [[silicone]] (usually above $3,000 at 2016 prices) or [[thermoplastic elastomer]] known as TPE (below $3,000). Dolls made of either material can be very lifelike, with faces and bodies modeled on real people in some instances, with realistic skin material (similar to that used for movie special effects), and with realistic (or even real) [[hair]]. These dolls usually have an articulated [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or metal [[skeleton]] with flexible joints that allows them to be positioned in a variety of positions for display and for sexual acts. Silicone or TPE dolls are much heavier than vinyl or latex inflatable ones (which consist mostly of air), but are roughly half the weight of a real human being of comparable size.\n\nBecause of their ability to be posed in different positions silicone dolls are popular with artists and photographers as models.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interview with Stacy Leigh | url = http://www.acclaimmag.com/arts/interview-stacy-leigh-nsfw/ | work = Acclaim Mag}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Home page | url = http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412131418/http://www.dollstory.eu/dollstory.aspx?code=video-poupees-tps&lang=EN | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2008-04-12 | publisher = Doll Story (French outlet of Japanese dolls) | quote = These silicone dolls are sold to passionate clients, but also to sculptors, painters and even photographers }} Links to examples of photographic work.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, sex dolls are known as {{nihongo|\"Dutch wives\"|[[:ja:\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5|\u30c0\u30c3\u30c1\u30ef\u30a4\u30d5]]|datchi waifu}}, which now refers to relatively inexpensive dolls.

The market has grown for two main reasons. Firstly, the last twenty years have seen huge improvements over earlier types of sex dolls, and customers come to realize this through using the web. Secondly, the method of retail purchase has also improved, now showing customers what the actual doll, seams, hair, and even orifices look like.\n\nIn China the market has mushroomed on account of the demographic effects of the one child policy and accordingly numerous new Chinese manufacturers have appeared in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Jiang | first = Quanbao | title = The predicament of bare branches' sexuality | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality]] | volume = 15 | publisher = [[Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality]] | date = September 18, 2012 | url = http://www.ejhs.org/volume15/Bare.html | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n== Non-standard forms ==\nIn Japan one can purchase inflatable love pillows  or \"[[dakimakura]]\" that are printed with a life-size picture of a porn star or anime character. Other less common novelty love dolls include overweight, intersex, elderly and alien dolls, which are usable for pleasure but also tend to be given as gag gifts. Some inflatable dolls even have the form of children.\n\nSome companies manufacture cloth sex dolls using the same technology that is used to create plush toys. With widespread cultural use of the internet amongst younger generations, numerous forums exist for amateurs who create their own sex dolls from fabric or other materials. There are even mailing lists for discussing techniques and experiences with ''MLDs'' (material love dolls) {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.\n\nSome inflatable sex dolls are made in the form of animals, most notably [[sheep]] and cows. These dolls are more of a joke gift or party novelty, and are often not suitable for sexual use{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}.\n\n== New materials and technologies ==\nSilicone dolls were at first made from tin-cure silicone but platinum technology has better longevity, less prone to tears and compression marks. For this reason the \"[[RealDoll]]\" manufacturer reported switching from the tin to the platinum material in June 2009<ref>[https://www.documentarystorm.com/guys-and-dolls/ Guys and Dolls Documentary] DocumentaryStorm.com. Retrieved 22 February 2019.</ref> and all other manufacturers have followed suit.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nSince 2012 or so a [[thermoplastic elastomer]] alternative known as TPE has come into common use particularly by Chinese manufacturers which has enabled realistic dolls to be made which are cheaper than those composed of the high quality expensive [[platinum cure silicone]].<ref>[https://dollview.com/silicone-vs-tpe/ DollView.com.

Both this company and the company \"First Androids\" once offered pelvic thruster motor, audio capability and heated orifices, though these options are no longer available. Several modern doll manufacturers now offer the last option on their silicone dolls, with the addition of an internal heating system.\n\n==Legal restrictions==\nThe importation of sex dolls for men has been banned in [[Botswana]] according to Section 178 of the Botswana Penal Code.

Although sex dolls originally started appearing in Austria around 1980, they gained popularity in 2017 when a brothel started offering sex doll services to clients.<ref>[http://sexclubwien.com/breaking-news/brothel-vienna-started-using-sex-dolls/ Brothel Vienna started using sex dolls]</ref> This can be contributed to the fact that the dolls have become more realistic in recent years.\n\nIn addition to being able to have intercourse with the sex doll, some places allow clients to purchase sex dolls for themselves. One of the biggest laufhauses in [[Vienna]] offers sex in the [[laufhaus]] with dolls alongside real women.\n\nAccording to brothel owners who offer sex dolls, the dolls are being properly cleaned after every session. Unprotected sex with sex dolls is also allowed, but it is not advised as there is no guarantee that the dolls are being cleaned after each client.<ref>[http://brothelvienna.info/articles/sex-doll-brothels-becoming-more-popular/ Sex doll brothels becoming more popular]</ref>\n\n=== South Korea ===\nIn 2019 the South Korean Supreme Court ruled to legalize the sale of sex dolls.
