In the 1930 FIFA World Cup, Bolivia painted before the starting match with Yugoslavia one of the letters in \"Viva Uruguay\" in each of the eleven starters' jerseys to please the local crowd.

Bolivia again painted a message to the hosts in the [[1945 South American Championship]], with the players' jerseys reading \"Viva Chile\". In 1946, Bolivia changed their jersey colors to black and white stripes, like the colors of the [[Cochabamba]] region. FBF reverted to white the following year. In 1957, FBF decided to use one of the colors in the [[Flag of Bolivia]]. Given red and yellow were used by many of the other South Americans, green became the primary color, leading to the nickname \"El Verde\" (\"The Green\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.serieaddicted.com/article/world-cup-kits_when-bolivia-wore-uruguayan-shirts-to-ingratiate-fans-.php |title=World Cup Kits: When Bolivia wore Uruguayan shirts to ingratiate fans |access-date=14 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715035955/http://www.serieaddicted.com/article/world-cup-kits_when-bolivia-wore-uruguayan-shirts-to-ingratiate-fans-.php |archive-date=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Kit providers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many visiting teams protest that the altitude gives Bolivia an unfair advantage against opponents. On 27 May 2007, [[FIFA]] declared that no World Cup Qualifying matches could be played in stadiums above 8,200 feet (2,500 m) above sea level. However, FIFA raised the altitude limit after months of campaigning against the ban, thus allowing the stadium to continue holding World Cup qualifying matches.\n\n==Competitive record==\n===FIFA

Bolivia's only goal of the game was a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] in the last minutes of the match by [[Marcelo Martins Moreno]].\n\n==Team image==\n===Kit history===\nBolivia's first uniforms were all white. In the 1930 FIFA World Cup, Bolivia painted before the starting match with Yugoslavia one of the letters in \"Viva Uruguay\" in each of the eleven starters' jerseys to please the local crowd. In the following game with Brazil, given the adversary also wore white Bolivia instead borrowed Uruguay's own blue uniform to play. Bolivia again painted a message to the hosts in the [[1945 South American Championship]], with the players' jerseys reading \"Viva Chile\". In 1946, Bolivia changed their jersey colors to black and white stripes, like the colors of the [[Cochabamba]] region. FBF reverted to white the following year. In 1957, FBF decided to use one of the colors in the [[Flag of Bolivia]]. Given red and yellow were used by many of the other South Americans, green became the primary color, leading to the nickname \"El Verde\" (\"The Green\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.serieaddicted.com/article/world-cup-kits_when-bolivia-wore-uruguayan-shirts-to-ingratiate-fans-.php |title=World Cup Kits: When Bolivia wore Uruguayan shirts to ingratiate fans |access-date=14 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715035955/http://www.serieaddicted.com/article/world-cup-kits_when-bolivia-wore-uruguayan-shirts-to-ingratiate-fans-.php |archive-date=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Kit providers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A. C. Bennett dam. The third dam,\"Site C,\" was also proposed at the time for a site 83&nbsp;km downriver of the Peace Canyon dam, or approximately 7&nbsp;km southwest of [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]]. Site C would flood an 83&nbsp;km length of the Peace River valley, widening the river by up to three times, as well as a 10&nbsp;km length of the [[Moberly Lake (British Columbia)|Moberly River]] valley and 14&nbsp;km of the [[Halfway River]] valley. The fourth proposed dam on the British Columbia segment of the Peace River, Site E, near the BC\u2013Alberta border, was removed from the planning process during hearings in 1982.\n[[File:Peace River Valley Site C Flooding Area.jpg|left|thumb|Portion of 80 kilometre stretch of valley planned for flooding]]\nAfter hearings between 1981 and 1983, the [[British Columbia Utilities Commission]] turned down the Site C project.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ordersdecisions.bcuc.com/bcuc/decisions/en/item/112107/index.do|title=BC Hydro Energy Project Certificate Application for Site C|last=H|first=M|website=www.ordersdecisions.bcuc.com|access-date=2016-07-07}}</ref> The commission was critical of BC Hydro's forecasting methods, declaring that it neither explicitly took energy prices into account nor relied on statistically significant past patterns of behaviour.<ref name=\":2\" /> BC Hydro then chose to purchase electricity under long-term contracts from independent power producers, and it continues to do so today.

In its Final Report published on November 1, 2019, the BCUC reached two overarching conclusions: \n\n* The cost to ratepayers of suspending construction would be significantly higher than either continuing or terminating the project, to the tune of $3.6 billion. In addition, there are significant risks that it would not be possible to restart the project due to permitting and other issues. \n  \n* The cost to ratepayers of continuing or terminating construction is similar, given the assumptions that the BCUC finds to be most reasonable. Both alternatives also have risks which may cause one or the other to be more costly to ratepayers either in the short-term or over a longer period.<ref>BCUC letter to the Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Respecting the Site C Inquiry, November 23, 2017, page 1.

While no determination as to the appropriate period was made, a 30-year period was assumed for the rate impact analysis with sensitivity analysis on 10- and 70-year amortization periods; and \n* The BCUC considered electrification in arriving at its assessment that it would be more appropriate to use BC Hydro\u2019s low load forecast in its economic analysis. The BCUC also considered recent developments in the industrial sectors, accuracy of historical load forecasts, GDP and other forecast drivers, price elasticity assumptions, future rate increases, potential disrupting trends and historical flattening electricity demand.<ref>BCUC letter to the Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Respecting the Site C Inquiry, November 23, 2017, pp. 18-25</ref>\n\n==Agricultural land impacts==\nAnnual flooding has deposited rich sediments along the low bank portions of the Peace River. The creation of the [[Williston Lake]] reservoir has improved agricultural use on the former floodplain.

In all, {{convert| 2,775|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of land will be removed from the ALR for the project. The Joint Review Panel accepted BC Hydro's assessment that \"production from the Peace River bottom lands is small and is certainly not important in the context of B.C.\" The Panel's assessment of earning potential in the next several decades led them to conclude: \"The highest and best use of the Peace River valley would appear to be as a reservoir.\"<ref name = JRP/>\n\nProfessional [[agrologist]] Wendy Holm, past president of the B.C. Institute of Agrologists, noted that flooding agricultural land in the Peace River valley is a bad idea, because it is \"the only large tract of land for future horticultural expansion in the province.\"  She notes that much of B.C.'s produce is imported from California, and growing food locally would increase food security for the province.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/news/729456/wendy-holm-why-all-fuss-over-site-c-dam |title=Why all the fuss over the Site C dam?\n|last=Holm|first=Wendy|date=July 2, 2016|newspaper=The Georgia Straight|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Suzuki]], flooding valuable farmland to build the dam will undermine Canada's international commitments under the [[Paris Agreement]].

BC Hydro, the public utility which built and operates the Bennett dam, opened a public display at the dam itself that acknowledged the harm done to the Tsay Keh Dene and Kwadacha First Nations. Speaking at the opening of the exhibit, a BC Hydro spokesperson said that the utility \"deeply regrets those impacts and we commit that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past\".<ref>Jonny Wake eld. \u201cB.C. Hydro acknowledges W.A.C. Bennett dam\u2019s dark side.\u201d Dawson Creek Mirror. 10 June 2016.</ref> The government failed to give proper consideration to Canada's legal obligation to protect Indigenous rights. It also failed to examine the impact of an influx of temporary workers on the safety of women, especially Indigenous women. The risk of serious harm to the rights of Indigenous peoples requires that large-scale resource development proceed only with their free, prior and informed consent.\n\nFirst Nations have identified hundreds of sacred sites or areas with cultural or historic significance in the planned Site C flood zone.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 5., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> The Indigenous peoples of the area use the valley to hunt, fish trap, and gather berries as well as conduct ceremonies and harvest wild foods. The valley is prime habitat for moose, which is a food source they rely on, and other animals like the bear and eagle. The dam could also harm an already threatened fish species, the bull trout. The flooding of the valley may poison the fish with methylmercury for 20\u201330 years.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 9., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref>\n\nResource extraction has led to rapid population growth in the region. As a result of road construction and logging, non-Indigenous fisherman and hunters now have access to dwindling harvests. Just over 110 square km is recognized as reserve lands and this is not enough to sustain First Nations cultures and traditions.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 8., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> Indigenous peoples have ongoing rights to harvest foods and practice their customs throughout their broader territory but because of intensive resource development there are fewer and fewer places left where this is possible. The Peace River Valley falls within the bounds of Treaty 8, which recognizes First Nations rights to hunt, trap, and fish throughout the region. Activist [[Helen Knott]] has said that if the valley is flooded then the promise of that treaty will be violated.\n\nIndigenous women and girls will face extra harm from this infrastructure project due to the influx of highly paid, temporary workers. Indigenous women and girls are at least 3 times more likely to experience violence than all other women and are 6 times more likely to be murdered.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 12., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> It is likely these stats are lower than reality because of the underreporting by Indigenous communities and failing to accurately record crimes by police when victims are Indigenous. Short-term and temporary workers in resource industry jobs in Peace River Valley generally get paid well above the national average, which attracts workers from all over the country. Most of the high paying jobs go to men and on average, women are actually paid below the national average for women.<ref name=\"amnesty.ca\">\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 13., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> The large number of high paid workers has driven up local prices including necessities such as housing, childcare and medical services. People who are not part of the resource sector (with high wages) are negatively affected and may not be able to afford suitable accommodations. A combination of low wages for women and a high cost of living create a dangerous dependency on a male partner make it hard for women to escape situations where their safety is at risk. The tens of thousands of men who pass through the region for work include some who are a threat to women and this is increased by the high-stress jobs, potential binge drinking and drug abuse. In 2014 Fort St. John had the highest per capita crime rate and the highest caseload per police officer among 31 BC municipalities.<ref name=\"amnesty.ca\"/>\n\n==Alternatives==\nElectricity conservation is the least-cost alternative. BC Hydro achieved savings at $20/MWh, while the estimated savings were at $30/MWh. Columbia Treaty and non-treaty power now sold to the US, is available at approximately $30/MWh, equivalent to Site C quantities. BC Hydro determined in the 2013 Integrated Resource Plan, DSM 5, that more than double the amount of power from Site C could be obtained from conservation at up to $45/MWh.{{Citation needed|reason= Very specific claim that needs corroboration data|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 2017, Alberta received quotations for 600 MW of wind power at $37/MWh.{{Citation needed|reason= Very specific claim that needs corroboration data|date=October 2019}}\n\nWhen BC Hydro buys power from [[Independent power producers in British Columbia|independent power producers]] they set a price as low as $76.20 per megawatt hour for intermittent power from wind farms, and as high as $133.80 for firm hydro power.

While no determination as to the appropriate period was made, a 30-year period was assumed for the rate impact analysis with sensitivity analysis on 10- and 70-year amortization periods; and \n* The BCUC considered electrification in arriving at its assessment that it would be more appropriate to use BC Hydro\u2019s low load forecast in its economic analysis. The BCUC also considered recent developments in the industrial sectors, accuracy of historical load forecasts, GDP and other forecast drivers, price elasticity assumptions, future rate increases, potential disrupting trends and historical flattening electricity demand.<ref>BCUC letter to the Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Respecting the Site C Inquiry, November 23, 2017, pp. 18-25</ref>\n\n==Agricultural land impacts==\nAnnual flooding has deposited rich sediments along the low bank portions of the Peace River.

The Joint Review Panel accepted BC Hydro's assessment that \"production from the Peace River bottom lands is small and is certainly not important in the context of B.C.\" The Panel's assessment of earning potential in the next several decades led them to conclude: \"The highest and best use of the Peace River valley would appear to be as a reservoir.\"<ref name = JRP/>\n\nProfessional [[agrologist]] Wendy Holm, past president of the B.C. Institute of Agrologists, noted that flooding agricultural land in the Peace River valley is a bad idea, because it is \"the only large tract of land for future horticultural expansion in the province.\"  She notes that much of B.C.'s produce is imported from California, and growing food locally would increase food security for the province.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/news/729456/wendy-holm-why-all-fuss-over-site-c-dam |title=Why all the fuss over the Site C dam?\n|last=Holm|first=Wendy|date=July 2, 2016|newspaper=The Georgia Straight|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Suzuki]], flooding valuable farmland to build the dam will undermine Canada's international commitments under the [[Paris Agreement]]. Suzuki considers the farmland essential to reduce B.C.'s dependence on imported foods and minimize the [[Carbon-based fuel|carbon fuels]] needed to transport those foods: \"It seems to me crazy to put farmland in the north underwater,\" Suzuki said. \"We live in a food chain now in which food grows on average 3,000 kilometres from where it's consumed.

BC Hydro, the public utility which built and operates the Bennett dam, opened a public display at the dam itself that acknowledged the harm done to the Tsay Keh Dene and Kwadacha First Nations. Speaking at the opening of the exhibit, a BC Hydro spokesperson said that the utility \"deeply regrets those impacts and we commit that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past\".<ref>Jonny Wake eld. \u201cB.C. Hydro acknowledges W.A.C. Bennett dam\u2019s dark side.\u201d Dawson Creek Mirror. 10 June 2016.</ref> The government failed to give proper consideration to Canada's legal obligation to protect Indigenous rights. It also failed to examine the impact of an influx of temporary workers on the safety of women, especially Indigenous women. The risk of serious harm to the rights of Indigenous peoples requires that large-scale resource development proceed only with their free, prior and informed consent.\n\nFirst Nations have identified hundreds of sacred sites or areas with cultural or historic significance in the planned Site C flood zone.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 5., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> The Indigenous peoples of the area use the valley to hunt, fish trap, and gather berries as well as conduct ceremonies and harvest wild foods. The valley is prime habitat for moose, which is a food source they rely on, and other animals like the bear and eagle. The dam could also harm an already threatened fish species, the bull trout. The flooding of the valley may poison the fish with methylmercury for 20\u201330 years.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 9., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref>\n\nResource extraction has led to rapid population growth in the region. As a result of road construction and logging, non-Indigenous fisherman and hunters now have access to dwindling harvests. Just over 110 square km is recognized as reserve lands and this is not enough to sustain First Nations cultures and traditions.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 8., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> Indigenous peoples have ongoing rights to harvest foods and practice their customs throughout their broader territory but because of intensive resource development there are fewer and fewer places left where this is possible. The Peace River Valley falls within the bounds of Treaty 8, which recognizes First Nations rights to hunt, trap, and fish throughout the region. Activist [[Helen Knott]] has said that if the valley is flooded then the promise of that treaty will be violated.\n\nIndigenous women and girls will face extra harm from this infrastructure project due to the influx of highly paid, temporary workers. Indigenous women and girls are at least 3 times more likely to experience violence than all other women and are 6 times more likely to be murdered.<ref>\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 12., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> It is likely these stats are lower than reality because of the underreporting by Indigenous communities and failing to accurately record crimes by police when victims are Indigenous. Short-term and temporary workers in resource industry jobs in Peace River Valley generally get paid well above the national average, which attracts workers from all over the country. Most of the high paying jobs go to men and on average, women are actually paid below the national average for women.<ref name=\"amnesty.ca\">\u201cThe Point of No Return.\u201d ''Amnesty International'', 2016, p. 13., www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/Canada Site C Report.pdf.</ref> The large number of high paid workers has driven up local prices including necessities such as housing, childcare and medical services. People who are not part of the resource sector (with high wages) are negatively affected and may not be able to afford suitable accommodations. A combination of low wages for women and a high cost of living create a dangerous dependency on a male partner make it hard for women to escape situations where their safety is at risk. The tens of thousands of men who pass through the region for work include some who are a threat to women and this is increased by the high-stress jobs, potential binge drinking and drug abuse. In 2014 Fort St. John had the highest per capita crime rate and the highest caseload per police officer among 31 BC municipalities.<ref name=\"amnesty.ca\"/>\n\n==Alternatives==\nElectricity conservation is the least-cost alternative. BC Hydro achieved savings at $20/MWh, while the estimated savings were at $30/MWh. Columbia Treaty and non-treaty power now sold to the US, is available at approximately $30/MWh, equivalent to Site C quantities. BC Hydro determined in the 2013 Integrated Resource Plan, DSM 5, that more than double the amount of power from Site C could be obtained from conservation at up to $45/MWh.{{Citation needed|reason= Very specific claim that needs corroboration data|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 2017, Alberta received quotations for 600 MW of wind power at $37/MWh.{{Citation needed|reason= Very specific claim that needs corroboration data|date=October 2019}}\n\nWhen BC Hydro buys power from [[Independent power producers in British Columbia|independent power producers]] they set a price as low as $76.20 per megawatt hour for intermittent power from wind farms, and as high as $133.80 for firm hydro power.
