Hewett rose to fame as the lead vocalist of the [[Grammy]] winning [[Contemporary R&B|R&B/soul]] vocal group [[Shalamar]]. He has collaborated or performed with George Duke,  Stanley Clarke, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Anita Baker, Dionne Warwick, Deniece Williams, Babyface, LaToya Jackson, and Teena Marie.\n\n==Biography==\nRaised in Akron, Ohio, Hewett moved to Los Angeles in 1976, where he met John and Alonzo Daniels, owners of an historical club in the LA [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles|Crenshaw]] district, called Maverick's Flat. It was at Maverick's that Hewett first met [[Jeffrey Daniel]] and [[Jody Watley]] (eventually [[Shalamar]]). Hewett and the Daniels brothers formed a show group called \"Beverly Hills\" and through Daniels bookings toured throughout Europe, the UK, Scandinavia and Asia for all of 1977 till the middle of 1978. After returning from overseas, Hewett started recording for [[Jeffrey Bowen]], a Motown producer ([[The Temptations]], [[Commodores]], [[Bonnie Pointer]]) who was working on a solo project on guitarist [[Eddie Hazel]] ([[Parliament-Funkadelic]]). Hewett never completed the project because towards the end of 1978, he got a call from Jeffrey Daniel, who was on the road with Shalamar in the middle of a promotional tour. They had suddenly found themselves in need of a lead singer and Daniel made Hewett an offer that he accepted. Within three days Hewett flew to [[New Jersey]], where he met up with Watley and Daniel, rehearsed the [[lip synch]] and choreography to the current Shalamar single \"[[Take That to the Bank]]\", and found himself in front of a TV camera on a local dance show in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. They completed the promotional tour and returned to Los Angeles and immediately started recording the ''[[Big Fun (Shalamar album)|Big Fun]]'' LP with their producer, [[Leon Sylvers III|Leon Sylvers]]. The trio went on to record songs such as \"[[The Second Time Around (Shalamar song)|Second Time Around]]\", \"[[Make that Move (song)|Make That Move]]\", \"[[A Night to Remember (Shalamar song)|A Night to Remember]]\", \"Dancing in the Sheets\" and the ballad \"[[This Is for the Lover in You]]\". Hewett was the group's lead singer from 1979 until 1985.\n\nWhen Shalamar broke up in the mid-1980s, Hewett went on to a successful solo career. However, in 1985 before signing his solo deal with Elektra Records, he was arrested and indicted in Miami with his fianc\u00e9e Mori Molina for possession with an intent to distribute cocaine.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lrQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA57&dq=miami+howard+hewett+cocaine+arrest&hl=en&ei=v4XQTfukI4r2swOIofC-Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Jet Magazine'' (February 3, 1986), \"Ex-Shalamar Leader Hit With Drug Rap\"].

The album also included \"Say Amen\", a gospel tune that became a surprise hit on the Gospel as well as Urban charts and is one of Hewett's many [[signature song]]s. \n\nIn 1990, Hewett released his self-titled album, which included the hit \"Show Me\" (R&B number 2), and 1992 saw the release of the [[Gramophone Record|LP]] ''Allegiance'', which was not received as well as previous albums. He contributed to the second season [[theme music|theme song]] of ''[[Hangin' With Mr. Cooper]]'', which was a remake of [[Sam & Dave]]'s R&B Top 10 hit \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\". This recording was produced by singer Steve Tyrell. After 1995's ''It's Time'' (released by Caliber Records in the US and Expansion Records in the UK), Hewett spent much of his time providing guest vocals on albums by [[jazz]] artists such as [[Joe Sample]], [[Brian Culbertson]], and [[George Duke]], among others. In 2000, [[The Rippingtons]] featured Hewett on \"I Found Heaven\" on their ''[[Life in the Tropics]]'' album.

The meat is usually ground (minced) rather than chopped, and different seasonings are used. This type is better known in Mexico and other parts of the Americas, including the border areas of the United States, and is not frequently found in Europe. It is typically spicier than Spanish and Portuguese varieties of the sausage, and often contains chili peppers that are higher on the [[Scoville scale]].

''Chorizo con huevos'' is a popular breakfast dish in Mexico and areas of the United States with Mexican populations. It is made by mixing fried chorizo with [[scrambled eggs]]. ''Chorizo con huevos'' is often used in breakfast burritos, tacos, and [[taquito]]s. Another popular Mexican recipe is fried chorizo combined with pinto or black [[refried beans]]. This combination is often used in ''tortas'' as a spread, or as a side dish where plain refried beans would normally be served. In Mexico, chorizo is also used to make the popular appetizer ''chorizo con queso'' (or ''choriqueso''), which is small pieces of chorizo served in or on melted cheese, and eaten with small [[corn tortilla]]s. In heavily Mexican parts of the United States, a popular filling for breakfast tacos is ''chorizo con papas'', or diced potatoes saut\u00e9ed until soft with chorizo mixed in.\n\n====Central America and the Caribbean====\n[[File:Salvadorean style chorizo.JPG|thumb|Salvadorean-style chorizo]]\nIn [[Puerto Rico]], [[Panama]], and [[the Dominican Republic]], chorizo and longaniza are considered two separate portions of meat. Puerto Rican chorizo is a smoked, well-seasoned sausage nearly identical to the smoked versions in Spain. Puerto Rican and Dominican longanizas have a very different taste and appearance. The seasoned meat is stuffed into a pork casing and is formed very long by hand. It is then hung to air-dry. Longaniza can then be fried in oil or cooked with rice or beans. It is eaten with many different dishes.\n\nChorizo is a popular pizza topping in Puerto Rico.\n\nSalvadorean chorizo is short, fresh (not dried) and tied in twins.\n\n====South America====\n[[File:Asadito.jpg|thumbnail|right|Argentinian ''chorizos'' in an ''[[asado]]'']]\nIn [[Ecuador]], many types of sausage have been directly adopted from European or North American cuisine. All sorts of salami, either raw or smoked, are just known as salami. Most commonly known are sorts from Spanish chorizo, Italian pepperoni, and wiener sausages; wieners are the most popular. Some local specialities include ''morcilla'', ''longaniza'', and ''chorizo''. ''Morcilla'', as in most Spanish-speaking countries, is basically cooked pork blood encased in pork intestine casing ([[black pudding]] in English). Longaniza is a thin sausage containing almost any mixture of meat, fat, or even cartilage, smoked rather than fresh. Chorizo is a mixture of chopped pork meat, pork fat, salt, whole pepper grains, cinnamon, ''achiote'', and other spices, which produce its characteristic deep red color. A traditional dish consists of fried egg, mashed potatoes, avocado, salad, and slices of fried chorizo.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], chorizo is the name for any coarse meat sausage. Spanish-style chorizo is also available, and is distinguished by the name \"chorizo espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish chorizo). Argentine chorizos are normally made of pork, and are not spicy hot. Some Argentine chorizos include other types of meat, typically beef. In Argentina, Bolivia, [[Paraguay]], Uruguay, Chile, and Peru, fresh chorizo, cooked and served in a bread roll, is called a ''[[chorip\u00e1n]]''. In Colombia, chorizo is usually accompanied by ''[[arepa]]''.\n\nIn Brazil, ''chouri\u00e7o'' is the word used for what in the rest of Latin America is ''morcilla''; meat sausages similar to the chorizos of other Latin American countries are called ''lingui\u00e7a''. Many varieties of Portuguese-style chouri\u00e7o and lingui\u00e7a are used in many different types of dishes, such as ''[[feijoada]]''.\n\nIn [[Bolivia]], chorizos are made of pork, fried and served with salad (tomato, lettuce, onion, boiled carrots and ''[[quirqui\u00f1a]]''), [[mote (food)|''mote'']], and a slice of bread soaked with chorizo fat. Chorizo [[sandwich]]es, without ''mote'', are also eaten.\n\n===Asia===\n====East Timor====\n[[File:Produ\u00e7\u00e3o caseira de chouri\u00e7os em Timor.jpg|thumb|Chouri\u00e7os in East Timor]]\nChouri\u00e7o is made in [[East Timor]].

They are also used, cut into chunks, as the meat ingredient in rice [[pilaf]]. They can be raw (wet), smoked or cured through salting and air-drying.\n\nThree kinds of chouri\u00e7o are found in Goa: dry, wet, and skin. Dry chouri\u00e7o is aged in the sun for long periods (three months or more). Wet chouri\u00e7o has been aged for about a month or less. Skin chouri\u00e7o, also aged, is rare and difficult to find. It consists primarily of minced pork skin along with some of its subcutaneous fat. All three chouri\u00e7os are made in variations such as hot, medium, and mild. Other variations exist, depending on the size of the links, which range from 1&nbsp;in (smallest) to 6&nbsp;in. Typically, the wet varieties tend to be longer than the dry ones.\n\nGoan chorizo should be distinguished from \"Goan [[Hot dog|frankfurters]]\", which look similar to equivalents in the United States, but with a predominantly peppercorn flavor.\n\n====Philippines====\n{{Main|Longganisa}}\n[[File:09794jfFajardo Echague Street Loyola Sampaloc Quiapo Manilafvf 16.jpg|thumb|Various types of Philippine ''[[longganisa]]s'' (''chorizos'') in [[Quiapo, Manila]]]]\n''Longaniza'' ({{lang-tl|longganisa}}; [[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''chorizo'', ''choriso'', ''soriso'') are [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Philippine]] chorizos flavored with indigenous spices, and may be made of chicken, beef, or even tuna.

The meat is usually ground (minced) rather than chopped, and different seasonings are used. This type is better known in Mexico and other parts of the Americas, including the border areas of the United States, and is not frequently found in Europe. It is typically spicier than Spanish and Portuguese varieties of the sausage, and often contains chili peppers that are higher on the [[Scoville scale]].

Served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it has the finely minced texture mentioned above, and is quite intense in flavor.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn Mexico, restaurants and food stands make tacos, ''[[queso fundido]]'' (or ''choriqueso''), [[burrito]]s, and ''[[torta]]s'' with cooked chorizo, and it is also a popular [[pizza]] topping. ''Chorizo con huevos'' is a popular breakfast dish in Mexico and areas of the United States with Mexican populations. It is made by mixing fried chorizo with [[scrambled eggs]]. ''Chorizo con huevos'' is often used in breakfast burritos, tacos, and [[taquito]]s. Another popular Mexican recipe is fried chorizo combined with pinto or black [[refried beans]]. This combination is often used in ''tortas'' as a spread, or as a side dish where plain refried beans would normally be served. In Mexico, chorizo is also used to make the popular appetizer ''chorizo con queso'' (or ''choriqueso''), which is small pieces of chorizo served in or on melted cheese, and eaten with small [[corn tortilla]]s. In heavily Mexican parts of the United States, a popular filling for breakfast tacos is ''chorizo con papas'', or diced potatoes saut\u00e9ed until soft with chorizo mixed in.\n\n====Central America and the Caribbean====\n[[File:Salvadorean style chorizo.JPG|thumb|Salvadorean-style chorizo]]\nIn [[Puerto Rico]], [[Panama]], and [[the Dominican Republic]], chorizo and longaniza are considered two separate portions of meat. Puerto Rican chorizo is a smoked, well-seasoned sausage nearly identical to the smoked versions in Spain. Puerto Rican and Dominican longanizas have a very different taste and appearance. The seasoned meat is stuffed into a pork casing and is formed very long by hand. It is then hung to air-dry. Longaniza can then be fried in oil or cooked with rice or beans. It is eaten with many different dishes.\n\nChorizo is a popular pizza topping in Puerto Rico.\n\nSalvadorean chorizo is short, fresh (not dried) and tied in twins.\n\n====South America====\n[[File:Asadito.jpg|thumbnail|right|Argentinian ''chorizos'' in an ''[[asado]]'']]\nIn [[Ecuador]], many types of sausage have been directly adopted from European or North American cuisine. All sorts of salami, either raw or smoked, are just known as salami. Most commonly known are sorts from Spanish chorizo, Italian pepperoni, and wiener sausages; wieners are the most popular. Some local specialities include ''morcilla'', ''longaniza'', and ''chorizo''. ''Morcilla'', as in most Spanish-speaking countries, is basically cooked pork blood encased in pork intestine casing ([[black pudding]] in English). Longaniza is a thin sausage containing almost any mixture of meat, fat, or even cartilage, smoked rather than fresh. Chorizo is a mixture of chopped pork meat, pork fat, salt, whole pepper grains, cinnamon, ''achiote'', and other spices, which produce its characteristic deep red color. A traditional dish consists of fried egg, mashed potatoes, avocado, salad, and slices of fried chorizo.\n\nIn [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], chorizo is the name for any coarse meat sausage. Spanish-style chorizo is also available, and is distinguished by the name \"chorizo espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish chorizo). Argentine chorizos are normally made of pork, and are not spicy hot. Some Argentine chorizos include other types of meat, typically beef. In Argentina, Bolivia, [[Paraguay]], Uruguay, Chile, and Peru, fresh chorizo, cooked and served in a bread roll, is called a ''[[chorip\u00e1n]]''. In Colombia, chorizo is usually accompanied by ''[[arepa]]''.\n\nIn Brazil, ''chouri\u00e7o'' is the word used for what in the rest of Latin America is ''morcilla''; meat sausages similar to the chorizos of other Latin American countries are called ''lingui\u00e7a''. Many varieties of Portuguese-style chouri\u00e7o and lingui\u00e7a are used in many different types of dishes, such as ''[[feijoada]]''.\n\nIn [[Bolivia]], chorizos are made of pork, fried and served with salad (tomato, lettuce, onion, boiled carrots and ''[[quirqui\u00f1a]]''), [[mote (food)|''mote'']], and a slice of bread soaked with chorizo fat. Chorizo [[sandwich]]es, without ''mote'', are also eaten.\n\n===Asia===\n====East Timor====\n[[File:Produ\u00e7\u00e3o caseira de chouri\u00e7os em Timor.jpg|thumb|Chouri\u00e7os in East Timor]]\nChouri\u00e7o is made in [[East Timor]].

They are also used, cut into chunks, as the meat ingredient in rice [[pilaf]]. They can be raw (wet), smoked or cured through salting and air-drying.\n\nThree kinds of chouri\u00e7o are found in Goa: dry, wet, and skin. Dry chouri\u00e7o is aged in the sun for long periods (three months or more). Wet chouri\u00e7o has been aged for about a month or less. Skin chouri\u00e7o, also aged, is rare and difficult to find. It consists primarily of minced pork skin along with some of its subcutaneous fat. All three chouri\u00e7os are made in variations such as hot, medium, and mild. Other variations exist, depending on the size of the links, which range from 1&nbsp;in (smallest) to 6&nbsp;in. Typically, the wet varieties tend to be longer than the dry ones.\n\nGoan chorizo should be distinguished from \"Goan [[Hot dog|frankfurters]]\", which look similar to equivalents in the United States, but with a predominantly peppercorn flavor.\n\n====Philippines====\n{{Main|Longganisa}}\n[[File:09794jfFajardo Echague Street Loyola Sampaloc Quiapo Manilafvf 16.jpg|thumb|Various types of Philippine ''[[longganisa]]s'' (''chorizos'') in [[Quiapo, Manila]]]]\n''Longaniza'' ({{lang-tl|longganisa}}; [[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''chorizo'', ''choriso'', ''soriso'') are [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Philippine]] chorizos flavored with indigenous spices, and may be made of chicken, beef, or even tuna.

In 1978, Rushaddin was appointed Western Regional Minister of the Nation of Islam and leader of Mosque #27. In 1983, Minister Farrakhan named him Khalid after the Islamic general [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], a follower of the prophet Muhammad, calling him the Sword of Allah.\n\nBy 1984, Muhammad had become one of Louis Farrakhan's most trusted advisors in the Nation of Islam. He traveled to Libya on a fund-raising trip, where he became well acquainted with that country's leader, [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]].

Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: suspension of [[election]]s and [[civil liberties]]; proclamation of a [[state of emergency]]; [[rule by decree]]; [[political repression|repression of political opponents]]; not abiding by the [[rule of law]] procedures, and [[cult of personality]].

They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n{{main|Roman dictator}}\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|align=right|image1=2017 Freedom House world map.png|image2=EIU Democracy Index 2017.svg|caption1=Country ratings from Freedom House's ''Freedom in the World 2017'' survey concerning the state of world freedom in 2016<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf Freedom in The World 2017 - Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727054703/https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf |date=2017-07-27 }} by ''Freedom House'', January 31, 2017</ref>\n<center>{{legend inline|#16A983|Free (86)}} {{legend inline|#E5B63B|Partly Free (59)}} {{legend inline|#6973A5|Not Free (50)}}</center>|caption2=2017 [[Democracy Index]] by ''[[The Economist]]'' in which countries marked in different shades of red of are considered undemocratic, with many being dictatorships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|title=Democracy Index 2017 - Economist Intelligence Unit|last=|first=|date=|website=EIU.com|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218214151/http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></center>}}\nAs late as the second half of the 19th century, the term ''dictator'' had occasional positive implications. For example, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the national leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lajos-Kossuth</ref> When creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. \n   \nPast that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''\".<ref name=\"guardian_obit\">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205070235/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |archive-date=2013-12-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with the regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator.

In some cases, this is perfectly legitimate; [[Francisco Franco]] was a lieutenant general in the Spanish Army before he became [[Head of state|Chief of State]] of [[Spain]]; [[Manuel Noriega]] was officially commander of the [[Panama]]nian Defense Forces. In other cases, the association is mere pretense.\n\nSome dictators have been masters of [[crowd manipulation]], such as Mussolini and Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Stalin and Franco.  Typically the dictator's people seize control of all media, censor or destroy the opposition, and give strong doses of [[propaganda]] daily, often built around a [[cult of personality]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Morstein |first=Marx Fritz |display-authors=etal |title=Propaganda and Dictatorship |publisher=Princeton UP |isbn=978-1406747249|date=March 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Modern usage in formal titles ==\n[[File:Ritratto di Giuseppe Garibaldi - Salvatore Lo Forte.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] proclaimed himself dictator of Sicily in 1860.]]\n[[File:Gen Aguinaldo.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Emilio Aguinaldo]], [[Dictatorial Government of the Philippines|Dictator of the Philippines]], 1889]]\nBecause of its negative and pejorative [[connotation]]s, modern authoritarian leaders very rarely (if ever) use the term ''dictator'' in their formal titles, instead they most often simply have title of [[President (government title)|president]].

The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.\n* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].\n* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].\nNote that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion. [[Monarch]]s and [[Military dictatorship|military dictators]] are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the [[nobility]] or the [[army]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Authoritarian personality]]\n* [[Benevolent dictator for life]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Dictator novel]]\n* [[Emergency powers]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts by country]]\n* [[List of political leaders who held active military ranks in office]]\n* [[List of political leaders who suspended the constitution]]\n* [[Lists of state leaders by year]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Military rule (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)]]\n*[[Supreme leader|Supreme Leader]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n* A&nbsp;{{note|Doctorate}}He conferred a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] on himself from [[Makerere University]].<ref name=Byword>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |title=Idi Amin: a byword for brutality |work=[[News24]] |accessdate=2007-12-02 |date=2003-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605070641/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 }}</ref>\n* B&nbsp;{{note|VC}}The Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>Lloyd, Lorna (2007) p.239</ref>\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book| last=Bunce & Wolchik| first=Valerie, Sharon L.| ref=Bunce & Wolchik| year=2012| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=-IRc_W_YBV0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Socialism+Vanquished,+Socialism+Challenged:+Eastern+Europe+and+China,+1989-2009| title= Socialism Vanquished, Socialism Challenged: Eastern Europe and China, 1989-2009 | accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9780199996261}}\n* {{cite book| last=Issac| first=Jeffrey C.| ref=Issac| year=2000| publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=1pl5T45FwIwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Between+Past+and+Future:+The+Revolutions+of+1989+and+Their+Aftermath| title= Between Past and Future: The Revolutions of 1989 and Their Aftermath| accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9789639116719}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Pavlowitch\n  | first = Stevan K.\n  | year = 2002\n  | chapter = \n  | title = Serbia: The History of an Idea\n  | page = 128\n  | publisher = [[New York University Press]]\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u46G_l3Cz20C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serbia:+The+History+of+an+Idea\n  | isbn = 978-0-8147-6708-5\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* [http://www.planetrulers.com/current-dictators Current Dictators of the World]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/ WorldStatesmen]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dictatorship|*]]\n[[Category:Heads of government]]\n[[Category:Heads of state]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Titles of national or ethnic leadership]]\n\n[[cs:Dikt\u00e1tor]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the ancient Roman title|Roman dictator|other uses}}\n{{redirect|Dictators|the American band|The Dictators}}\n{{short description|Political leader who possesses absolute power}}\n[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Green Caesar|Bust of Julius Caesar]], first lifetime dictator of the Roman Republic, who through a series of legal maneuvers transformed the state into a legal autocracy.

They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n{{main|Roman dictator}}\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|align=right|image1=2017 Freedom House world map.png|image2=EIU Democracy Index 2017.svg|caption1=Country ratings from Freedom House's ''Freedom in the World 2017'' survey concerning the state of world freedom in 2016<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf Freedom in The World 2017 - Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727054703/https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf |date=2017-07-27 }} by ''Freedom House'', January 31, 2017</ref>\n<center>{{legend inline|#16A983|Free (86)}} {{legend inline|#E5B63B|Partly Free (59)}} {{legend inline|#6973A5|Not Free (50)}}</center>|caption2=2017 [[Democracy Index]] by ''[[The Economist]]'' in which countries marked in different shades of red of are considered undemocratic, with many being dictatorships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|title=Democracy Index 2017 - Economist Intelligence Unit|last=|first=|date=|website=EIU.com|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218214151/http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></center>}}\nAs late as the second half of the 19th century, the term ''dictator'' had occasional positive implications. For example, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the national leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lajos-Kossuth</ref> When creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. \n   \nPast that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''\".<ref name=\"guardian_obit\">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205070235/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |archive-date=2013-12-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with the regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator.

In other cases, the association is mere pretense.\n\nSome dictators have been masters of [[crowd manipulation]], such as Mussolini and Hitler.

Most Gulag inmates were not political prisoners, although significant numbers of political prisoners could be found in the camps at any one time.

The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.\n* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].\n* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].\nNote that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion. [[Monarch]]s and [[Military dictatorship|military dictators]] are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the [[nobility]] or the [[army]])..\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Authoritarian personality]]\n* [[Benevolent dictator for life]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Dictator novel]]\n* [[Emergency powers]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts by country]]\n* [[List of political leaders who held active military ranks in office]]\n* [[List of political leaders who suspended the constitution]]\n* [[Lists of state leaders by year]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Military rule (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)]]\n*[[Supreme leader|Supreme Leader]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n* A&nbsp;{{note|Doctorate}}He conferred a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] on himself from [[Makerere University]].<ref name=Byword>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |title=Idi Amin: a byword for brutality |work=[[News24]] |accessdate=2007-12-02 |date=2003-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605070641/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 }}</ref>\n* B&nbsp;{{note|VC}}The Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>Lloyd, Lorna (2007) p.239</ref>\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book| last=Bunce & Wolchik| first=Valerie, Sharon L.| ref=Bunce & Wolchik| year=2012| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=-IRc_W_YBV0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Socialism+Vanquished,+Socialism+Challenged:+Eastern+Europe+and+China,+1989-2009| title= Socialism Vanquished, Socialism Challenged: Eastern Europe and China, 1989-2009 | accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9780199996261}}\n* {{cite book| last=Issac| first=Jeffrey C.| ref=Issac| year=2000| publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=1pl5T45FwIwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Between+Past+and+Future:+The+Revolutions+of+1989+and+Their+Aftermath| title= Between Past and Future: The Revolutions of 1989 and Their Aftermath| accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9789639116719}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Pavlowitch\n  | first = Stevan K.\n  | year = 2002\n  | chapter = \n  | title = Serbia: The History of an Idea\n  | page = 128\n  | publisher = [[New York University Press]]\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u46G_l3Cz20C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serbia:+The+History+of+an+Idea\n  | isbn = 978-0-8147-6708-5\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* [http://www.planetrulers.com/current-dictators Current Dictators of the World]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/ WorldStatesmen]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dictatorship|*]]\n[[Category:Heads of government]]\n[[Category:Heads of state]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Titles of national or ethnic leadership]]\n\n[[cs:Dikt\u00e1tor]]\n", "name_user": "Killuminator", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn game theory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator"}
