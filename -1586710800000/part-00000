Administratively, the island constitutes the [[Bozcaada, \u00c7anakkale|Bozcaada district]] of [[\u00c7anakkale province]]. With an area of {{convert|39.9|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the third largest Turkish island after [[Imbros]] (G\u00f6k\u00e7eada) and [[Marmara Island|Marmara]]. {{As of|2011|alt=In 2011}}, the district had a population of 2,472. The main industries are tourism, wine production and fishing. The island has been famous for its grapes, wines and red poppies for centuries. It is a former bishopric and present Latin Catholic titular see.\n\nAs Tenedos, it is mentioned in both the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Aeneid]]'', in the latter as the site where the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Greeks]] hid their fleet near the end of the [[Trojan War]] in order to trick the Trojans into believing the war was over and into taking the [[Trojan Horse]] within their city walls. The island was important throughout [[classical antiquity]] despite its small size due to its strategic location at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]]. In the following centuries, the island came under the control of a succession of regional powers, including the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]], the [[Delian League]], the empire of [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]], the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor, the [[Byzantine Empire]], before passing to the [[Republic of Venice]]. As a result of the [[War of Chioggia]] (1381) between [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]] the entire population was evacuated and the town was demolished. The [[Ottoman Empire]] established control over the deserted island in 1455. During Ottoman rule, it was resettled by both Greeks and Turks. In 1807, the island was temporarily occupied by the [[Russian Empire|Russians]]. During this invasion the town was burnt down and many Turkish residents left the island.\n\nUnder Greek administration between 1912 and 1923, Tenedos was ceded according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] to the new Turkish republic that emerged with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1923. The treaty called for a quasi-autonomous administration to accommodate the local Greek population and excluded the [[Greeks]] on the two islands of [[Imbros]] and Tenedos from the wider population exchanges that took place between Greece and Turkey. Tenedos remained majority Greek until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many Greeks emigrated because of systemic discrimination and better opportunities elsewhere. Starting with the second half of the 20th century, there has been immigration from mainland [[Anatolia]], especially from the town of [[Bayrami\u00e7]].\n\n== Name ==\n[[File:Greek Silver Tetradrachm of Tenedos (Mysia, Islands off Troas), a Wonderful Janiform Head of Zeus and Hera.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient silver [[Tetradrachm]] from Tenedos, depicting Zeus and Hera and bearing the inscription \"\u03a4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\" (Tenedion) on the other side]]\n\nThe island is known in English as both Tenedos (the Greek name) and Bozcaada (the Turkish name). Over the centuries many other names have been used.{{sfn|Yale|2012|ps=}} Documented [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] names for the island are Leukophrys,<ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/tau/310 Suda Encyclopedia, tau.311]</ref><ref>[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/photius/conon.htm Conon, Narrations (Photius), \u00a728]</ref> Calydna, Phoenice and Lyrnessus ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], HN 5,140).{{sfn|Tenedos|2012|ps=}} The official Turkish name for the island is Bozcaada,;the Turkish word \"boz\" means either a barren land or grey to brown color (sources indicate both of these meanings may have been associated with the island) and \"ada\" meaning island.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=44|ps=}} The name Tenedos was derived, according to [[Apollodorus of Athens]], from the [[Greek hero]] [[Tenes]], who ruled the island at the time of the [[Trojan War]] and was killed by [[Achilles]]. Apollodorus writes that the island was originally known as Leocophrys until Tenes landed on the island and became the ruler.{{sfn|Apollodorus|1976|ps=}} The island became known as Bozcaada when the Ottoman Empire took the island over.{{sfn|Sugar|1996|ps=}} Tenedos remained a common name for the island along with Bozcaada after the Ottoman conquest of the island, often with Greek populations and Turkish populations using different names for the island.{{sfn|Bozcaada|2012|ps=}}\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n[[File:Bozcaada - ISS027.JPG|thumb|Satellite picture of the island]]\nTenedos is roughly triangular in shape. Its area is {{convert|39.9|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Turkish Statistical Institute-Stat Yearbook|2009|ps=}} It is the third largest Turkish island after [[Marmara Island]] and [[Imbros]] (G\u00f6k\u00e7eada).{{sfn|Yale|2012|ps=}} It is surrounded by small islets, and is situated close to the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]]. It is the only rural district (''[[Districts of Turkey|il\u00e7e]]'') of Turkey without any villages, and has only one major settlement, the town center.\n\nGeological evidence suggests that the island broke away from the mainland producing a terrain that is mainly plains in the west with hills in the Northeast, and the highest point is {{convert|192|m|ft}}. The central part of the island is the most amenable to agricultural activities.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|ps=}} There is a small pine forest in the Southwestern part of the island.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  The westernmost part of the island has large sandy areas not suitable for agriculture.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|ps=}}\n\nThe island has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with strong northern winds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  Average temperature is {{convert|14|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and average annual precipitation is {{convert|529|mm|in}}.{{sfn|Weatherbase: Bozcaada, Turkey|ps=}} There are a number of small streams running from north to south at the southwestern part of the island.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|ps=}} Freshwater sources though are not enough for the island so water is piped in from the mainland.{{sfn|ALTYAPI DURUMU|ps=}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nArcheological findings indicate that the first human settlement on the island dates back to the [[Bronze Age|Early Bronze Age II]] (ca. 3000\u20132700 BC). Archaeological evidence suggests the culture on the island had elements in common with the cultures of northwestern [[Anatolia]] and the [[Cycladic Islands]]. {{sfn|Sevin\u00e7|Takao\u011flu|2004|ps=}} Most settlement was on the small bays on the east side of the island which formed natural harbours. Settlement archaeological work was done quickly and thus did not find definitive evidence of grape cultivation on the island during this period. However, grape cultivation was common on neighboring islands and the nearby mainland during this time.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|pp=119\u2013120|ps=}}\n\nAccording to a reconstruction, based on the myth of Tenes, [[Walter Leaf]] stated that the first inhabitants of the island could be [[Pelasgians]], who were driven out of the Anatolian mainland by the [[Phrygians]].{{sfn|Leaf|Strabo|1923|p=218|ps=}} According to the same author, there are possible traces of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] influence in the island.{{sfn|Leaf|Strabo|1923|Book XIII, Cap. I|p=220|ps=}}\n\n===Antiquity<!--'Ancient Tenedos' redirects here-->===\n[[File:Troas.svg|thumb|350px|right|Tenedos next to ancient Troy, with Imbros to the north and Lesbos to the south.|alt=Map of Tenedos, a small island next to Troy and the larger Lesbos]]\nAncient Tenedos is referred to in Greek and Roman mythology, and archaeologists have uncovered evidence of its settlement from the Bronze Age. It would stay prominent through the age of classical Greece, fading by the time of the dominance of [[ancient Rome]]. Although a small island, Tenedos's position in the straits and its two harbors made it important to the [[Mediterranean]] powers over the centuries. For nine months of the year, the currents and the prevailing wind, the [[Etesian]], came, and still come, from the [[Black Sea]] hampering sailing vessels headed for Constantinople. They had to wait a week or more at Tenedos, waiting for the favorable southerly wind. Tenedos thus served as a shelter and way station for ships bound for the [[Hellespont]], [[Propontis]], [[Bosphorus]], and places farther on. Several of the regional powers captured or attacked the island, including the [[Athenians]], the Persians, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] under [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Seleucids]] and the [[Attalids]].{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}}\n\n=== Mythology ===\nHomer mentions [[Apollo]] as the chief deity of Tenedos in his time. According to him, the island was captured by [[Achilles]] during the siege of [[Troy]].{{sfn|Cramer|1832|p=112|ps=}} [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] obtained his slave [[Hecamede]] there during one of Achilles's raids. Nestor also sailed back from Troy stopping at Tenedos and island-hopping to Lesbos.{{sfn|Neilson|2009|p=54|ps=}} ''[[The Odyssey]]'' mentions the Greeks leaving Troy after winning the war first traveled to nearby Tenedos, sacrificed there,{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}} and then went to Lesbos before pausing to choose between alternative routes.{{sfn|Tozer|1897|p=23|ps=}}\n\nHomer, in the [[Iliad]] mention that between Tenedos and [[Imbros]] there was a wide cavern, in which [[Poseidon]] stayed his horses.<ref>[[Homer]], [[The Iliad]] Book XIII.</ref>{{sfn|Cramer|1832|p=113|ps=}}\n\n[[Virgil]], in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', described the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] hiding their fleet at Tenedos's bay, toward the end of the Trojan War, to trick [[Troy]] into believing the war was over and allowing them to take the [[Trojan Horse]] within Troy's city walls. In ''Aeneid'', it is also the island from which twin serpents came to kill the Trojan priest [[Laoco\u00f6n]] and his sons as punishment for throwing a spear at the Trojan Horse.{{sfn|Vergil|19 BCE|ps=}} According to [[Pindar]] (Nemean Odes no. 11), the island was founded after the war by bronze-clad warriors from [[Amyclae|Amyklai]], traveling with [[Orestes]].{{sfn|Nagy|2012|ps=}}\n\nAccording to myth, Tenes was the son of [[Cycnus]], himself the son of [[Poseidon]] and Calyce. Philonome, Cycnus's second wife and hence Tenes's stepmother, tried to seduce Tenes and was rejected. She then accused him of rape leading to his abandonment at sea along with his sister. They washed up on the island of Leucophrys where he was proclaimed king and the island renamed Tenedos in his honor. When Cycnus realized the lie behind the allegations he took a ship to apologize to his son. The myths differ on whether they reconciled.{{sfn|Thorburn Jr.|2005|p=163|ps=}} According to one version, when the father landed on the island of Tenedos, Tenes cut the cord holding his boat. The phrase 'hatchet of Tenes' came to mean resentment that could not be soothed.{{sfn|Lempri\u00e8re|1804|ps=}} Another myth had Achilles landing on Tenedos, while sailing from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] to Troy. There his navy stormed the island, and Achilles fought Tenes, in this myth a son of Apollo, and killed him, not knowing Tenes's lineage and hence unaware of the danger of Apollo's revenge. Achilles would also later kill Tenes's father, Cycnus, at Troy.{{sfn|Thorburn Jr.|2005|p=7|ps=}} In [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Philoctetes]]'', written in 409 BC, a serpent bit Philoctetes in the foot at Tenedos. According to [[Hyginus]], the goddess [[Hera]], upset with Philoctetes for helping [[Hercules]], had sent the snake to punish him. His wound refused to heal, and the Greeks abandoned him, before going back to him for help later during the attack on Troy.{{sfn|Thorburn Jr.|2005|p=433\u2013434|ps=}} [[Athenaeus]] quoted Nymphodorus's remarks on the beauty of the women of Tenedos.{{sfn|Cramer|1832|p=113|ps=}}\n\n[[Callimachus]] talked of a myth in which Ino's son Melikertes washed up dead in Tenedos after being thrown into the sea by his mother, who killed herself too; the residents, Lelegians, built an altar for Melikertes and started a ritual of a woman sacrificing her infant child when the town's need was dire. The woman would then be blinded.{{sfn|Pache|2004|ps=}} The myths also added that the custom was abolished when Orestes' descendants settled the place.{{sfn|Hughes|1991|p=86|ps=}}\n\n[[Neoptolemus]] stayed two days at Tenedos, following the advice of [[Thetis]], before he go to the land of the [[Molossians]] together with [[Helenus]].<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/150#e.6.12 Apollodorus, Library, e.6.12]</ref>\n\n===Archaic period===\nIt was at Tenedos, along with Lesbos, that the first coins with Greek writing on them were minted.{{sfn|Rose|2008|ps=}} Figures of bunches of grapes and wine vessels such as [[amphorae]] and [[Kantharos|kantharoi]] were stamped on coins.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=338|ps=}} The very first coins had a twin head of a male and a female on the obverse side.{{sfnm|1a1=Hands|1y=1907|1p=58|2a1=Ridgeway|2y=1892|2p=318|ps=}} The early coins were of silver and had a double-headed axe imprinted on them. [[Aristotle]] considered the axe as symbolizing the decapitation of those convicted of adultery, a Tenedian decree.{{sfn|Ridgeway|1892|p=318|ps=}} The axe-head was either a religious symbol or the seal of a trade unit of currency.{{sfn|Hands|1907|p=58|ps=}} Apollo Smintheus, a god who both protected against and brought about plague, was worshipped in late Bronze Age Tenedos.{{sfnm|1a1=Wood|1y=1996|1p=234||2a1=Farnell|2y=1907|ps=}} [[Strabo]]'s Geography writes that Tenedos \"contains an [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] city and has two harbours, and a temple of Apollo Smintheus\" ([[Geographica|Strabo's Geography, Vol. 13]]). The relationship between Tenedos and Apollo is mentioned in Book I of the Iliad where a priest calls to Apollo with the name \"O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might\"(''[[Iliad]]'' I).{{sfn|Price|2006|ps=}}\n\nDuring the later part of the Bronze Age and during the [[Iron Age]], the place served as a major point between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' mentions the Tenedos of this era. The culture and artisanship of the area, as represented by pottery and metal vessels recovered from graves, matched that of the northeastern Aegean. Archaeologists have found no evidence to substantiate Herodotus's assertion Aeolians had settled in Tenedos by the Bronze Age. Homer mentions Tenedos as a base for the Achaean fleet during the Trojan war.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|p=120|ps=}}\n\nThe Iron Age settlement of the northeast Aegean was once attributed to Aeolians, descendants of [[Orestes]] and hence of the [[House of Atreus]] in [[Mycenae]], from across the Aegean from [[Thessaly]], [[Boiotia]] and [[Akhaia]], all in mainland Greece. [[Pindar]], in his 11th Nemean Ode, hints at a group of [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesians]], the children of the fighters at Troy, occupying Tenedos, with Orestes, the son of [[Agamemnon]], landing straight on the island; specifically he refers to a Spartan Peisandros and his descendant Aristagoras, with Peisandaros having come over with Orestes. [[Strabo]] places the start of the migration sixty years after the Trojan war, initiated by Orestes's son, Penthilos, with the colonization continuing onto Penthilos's grandson.{{sfn|Rose|2008|ps=}}\n\nThe archaeological record provides no supporting evidence for the theory of Aiolian occupation. During the pre-archaic period, adults in Lesbos were buried by placing them in large jars, and later clay coverings were used, similar to Western [[Asia Minor]]. Still later, Tenedians began to both bury and cremate their adults in pits buttressed with stone along the walls. Children were still buried covered in jars. Some items buried with the person, such as pottery, gifts and safety-pin-like clasps, resemble what is found in Anatolia, in both style and drawings and pictures, more than they resemble burial items in mainland Greece.{{sfn|Rose|2008|ps=}}\n\nWhile human, specifically infant, sacrifice has been mentioned in connection with Tenedos's ancient past, it is now considered mythical in nature. The hero Paleomon in Tenedos was worshipped by a cult in that island, and the sacrifices were attributed to the cult.{{sfn|Hughes|1991|p=134|ps=}} At Tenedos, people did sacrifice a newborn calf dressed in [[buskins]], after treating the cow like a pregnant women giving birth; the person who killed the calf was then stoned and driven out into a life on the sea.{{sfn|Hughes|1991|p=86|ps=}} Per [[Harold Willoughby]], a belief in the calf as a ritual incarnation of God drove this practice.{{sfn|Willoughby|1929|ps=}}\n\n=== Classical period ===\nFrom the Archaic to Classical period, the archaeological evidence of well-stocked graves establishes Tenedos's continuing affluence. Tall, broad-mouthed containers show grapes and olives were likely processed during this time. They were also used to bury dead infants. By the fourth century BC, grapes and wine had become relevant to the economy of the island. Tenedians likely exported surplus wine. Writings from this era talk of a shortage of agricultural land, indicating a booming settlement. A dispute with the neighboring island of [[Sigeum]] was arbitrated by Periander of [[Corinth]], who handed over political control of a swath of the mainland to Tenedos. In the first century BC this territory was eventually incorporated into [[Alexandria Troas]].{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|pp=121\u2013122|ps=}}\n\nAccording to some accounts, [[Thales]] of Greece died in Tenedos. [[Cleostratus]], an astronomer, lived and worked in Tenedos, though it is unknown whether he met Thales there. Cleostratus is one of the founders of Greek astronomy, influenced as it was by the reception of Babylonian knowledge.{{sfn|Sarton|1952|p=178|ps=}} Athens had a naval base on the island in the fifth and fourth century BC.

In 1376, John V sold the island to Venice on the same terms as before. This upset the Genoese of Galata. The Genoese helped the imprisoned Andronikos to escape and depose his father. Andronikos repaid the favor ceding them Tenedos. But the garrison on the island refused the agreement and gave control over to the Venetians.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=780|ps=}}\n\nThe Venetians established an outpost on the island, a move that caused significant tension with the Byzantine Empire (then represented by Andronikos IV)and the Genoese.

The [[baillie]] of Tenedos, Zanachi Mudazzo, refused to evacuate the place, and the [[Doge]] of Venice, Antonio Venier, protested the expulsion. The senators of Venice reaffirmed the treaty, the proposed solution of handing the island back to the Emperor seen as unacceptable to the Genoese. Toward the end of 1383, the population of almost 4000 was shipped out to [[Euboea]] and [[Crete]]. Buildings on the island were then razed leaving it empty. Venetians continued to use the harbor.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=318\u2013319|ps=}}\n\nThe Venetians were zealous guarding the right to Tenedos the Treaty of Turin provided them.

Administratively, the island constitutes the [[Bozcaada, \u00c7anakkale|Bozcaada district]] of [[\u00c7anakkale province]]. With an area of {{convert|39.9|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the third largest Turkish island after [[Imbros]] (G\u00f6k\u00e7eada) and [[Marmara Island|Marmara]]. {{As of|2011|alt=In 2011}}, the district had a population of 2,472. The main industries are tourism, wine production and fishing. The island has been famous for its grapes, wines and red poppies for centuries. It is a former bishopric and present Latin Catholic titular see.\n\nAs Tenedos, it is mentioned in both the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Aeneid]]'', in the latter as the site where the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Greeks]] hid their fleet near the end of the [[Trojan War]] in order to trick the Trojans into believing the war was over and into taking the [[Trojan Horse]] within their city walls. The island was important throughout [[classical antiquity]] despite its small size due to its strategic location at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]]. In the following centuries, the island came under the control of a succession of regional powers, including the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]], the [[Delian League]], the empire of [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]], the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor, the [[Byzantine Empire]], before passing to the [[Republic of Venice]]. As a result of the [[War of Chioggia]] (1381) between [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]] the entire population was evacuated and the town was demolished. The [[Ottoman Empire]] established control over the deserted island in 1455. During Ottoman rule, it was resettled by both Greeks and Turks. In 1807, the island was temporarily occupied by the [[Russian Empire|Russians]]. During this invasion the town was burnt down and many Turkish residents left the island.\n\nUnder Greek administration between 1912 and 1923, Tenedos was ceded according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] to the new Turkish republic that emerged with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1923. The treaty called for a quasi-autonomous administration to accommodate the local Greek population and excluded the [[Greeks]] on the two islands of [[Imbros]] and Tenedos from the wider population exchanges that took place between Greece and Turkey. Tenedos remained majority Greek until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many Greeks emigrated because of systemic discrimination and better opportunities elsewhere. Starting with the second half of the 20th century, there has been immigration from mainland [[Anatolia]], especially from the town of [[Bayrami\u00e7]].\n\n== Name ==\n[[File:Greek Silver Tetradrachm of Tenedos (Mysia, Islands off Troas), a Wonderful Janiform Head of Zeus and Hera.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient silver [[Tetradrachm]] from Tenedos, depicting Zeus and Hera and bearing the inscription \"\u03a4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\" (Tenedion) on the other side]]\n\nThe island is known in English as both Tenedos (the Greek name) and Bozcaada (the Turkish name). Over the centuries many other names have been used.{{sfn|Yale|2012|ps=}} Documented [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] names for the island are Leukophrys,<ref>[https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/tau/310 Suda Encyclopedia, tau.311]</ref><ref>[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/photius/conon.htm Conon, Narrations (Photius), \u00a728]</ref> Calydna, Phoenice and Lyrnessus ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], HN 5,140).{{sfn|Tenedos|2012|ps=}} The official Turkish name for the island is Bozcaada,;the Turkish word \"boz\" means either a barren land or grey to brown color (sources indicate both of these meanings may have been associated with the island) and \"ada\" meaning island.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=44|ps=}} The name Tenedos was derived, according to [[Apollodorus of Athens]], from the [[Greek hero]] [[Tenes]], who ruled the island at the time of the [[Trojan War]] and was killed by [[Achilles]]. Apollodorus writes that the island was originally known as Leocophrys until Tenes landed on the island and became the ruler.{{sfn|Apollodorus|1976|ps=}} The island became known as Bozcaada when the Ottoman Empire took the island over.{{sfn|Sugar|1996|ps=}} Tenedos remained a common name for the island along with Bozcaada after the Ottoman conquest of the island, often with Greek populations and Turkish populations using different names for the island.{{sfn|Bozcaada|2012|ps=}}\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n[[File:Bozcaada - ISS027.JPG|thumb|Satellite picture of the island]]\nTenedos is roughly triangular in shape.

It is the only rural district (''[[Districts of Turkey|il\u00e7e]]'') of Turkey without any villages, and has only one major settlement, the town center.\n\nGeological evidence suggests that the island broke away from the mainland producing a terrain that is mainly plains in the west with hills in the Northeast, and the highest point is {{convert|192|m|ft}}. The central part of the island is the most amenable to agricultural activities.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|ps=}} There is a small pine forest in the Southwestern part of the island.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  The westernmost part of the island has large sandy areas not suitable for agriculture.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|ps=}}\n\nThe island has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with strong northern winds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  Average temperature is {{convert|14|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and average annual precipitation is {{convert|529|mm|in}}.{{sfn|Weatherbase: Bozcaada, Turkey|ps=}} There are a number of small streams running from north to south at the southwestern part of the island.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|ps=}} Freshwater sources though are not enough for the island so water is piped in from the mainland.{{sfn|ALTYAPI DURUMU|ps=}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nArcheological findings indicate that the first human settlement on the island dates back to the [[Bronze Age|Early Bronze Age II]] (ca. 3000\u20132700 BC). Archaeological evidence suggests the culture on the island had elements in common with the cultures of northwestern [[Anatolia]] and the [[Cycladic Islands]]. {{sfn|Sevin\u00e7|Takao\u011flu|2004|ps=}} Most settlement was on the small bays on the east side of the island which formed natural harbours. Settlement archaeological work was done quickly and thus did not find definitive evidence of grape cultivation on the island during this period. However, grape cultivation was common on neighboring islands and the nearby mainland during this time.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|pp=119\u2013120|ps=}}\n\nAccording to a reconstruction, based on the myth of Tenes, [[Walter Leaf]] stated that the first inhabitants of the island could be [[Pelasgians]], who were driven out of the Anatolian mainland by the [[Phrygians]].{{sfn|Leaf|Strabo|1923|p=218|ps=}} According to the same author, there are possible traces of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] influence in the island.{{sfn|Leaf|Strabo|1923|Book XIII, Cap.

It would stay prominent through the age of classical Greece, fading by the time of the dominance of [[ancient Rome]]. Although a small island, Tenedos's position in the straits and its two harbors made it important to the [[Mediterranean]] powers over the centuries. For nine months of the year, the currents and the prevailing wind, the [[Etesian]], came, and still come, from the [[Black Sea]] hampering sailing vessels headed for Constantinople. They had to wait a week or more at Tenedos, waiting for the favorable southerly wind. Tenedos thus served as a shelter and way station for ships bound for the [[Hellespont]], [[Propontis]], [[Bosphorus]], and places farther on. Several of the regional powers captured or attacked the island, including the [[Athenians]], the Persians, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] under [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Seleucids]] and the [[Attalids]].{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}}\n\n=== Mythology ===\nHomer mentions [[Apollo]] as the chief deity of Tenedos in his time.

In ''Aeneid'', it is also the island from which twin serpents came to kill the Trojan priest [[Laoco\u00f6n]] and his sons as punishment for throwing a spear at the Trojan Horse.{{sfn|Vergil|19 BCE|ps=}} According to [[Pindar]] (Nemean Odes no. 11), the island was founded after the war by bronze-clad warriors from [[Amyclae|Amyklai]], traveling with [[Orestes]].{{sfn|Nagy|2012|ps=}}\n\nAccording to myth, Tenes was the son of [[Cycnus]], himself the son of [[Poseidon]] and Calyce. Philonome, Cycnus's second wife and hence Tenes's stepmother, tried to seduce Tenes and was rejected. She then accused him of rape leading to his abandonment at sea along with his sister. They washed up on the island of Leucophrys where he was proclaimed king and the island renamed Tenedos in his honor. When Cycnus realized the lie behind the allegations he took a ship to apologize to his son. The myths differ on whether they reconciled.{{sfn|Thorburn Jr.|2005|p=163|ps=}} According to one version, when the father landed on the island of Tenedos, Tenes cut the cord holding his boat.

There his navy stormed the island, and Achilles fought Tenes, in this myth a son of Apollo, and killed him, not knowing Tenes's lineage and hence unaware of the danger of Apollo's revenge. Achilles would also later kill Tenes's father, Cycnus, at Troy.{{sfn|Thorburn Jr.|2005|p=7|ps=}} In [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Philoctetes]]'', written in 409 BC, a serpent bit Philoctetes in the foot at Tenedos. According to [[Hyginus]], the goddess [[Hera]], upset with Philoctetes for helping [[Hercules]], had sent the snake to punish him. His wound refused to heal, and the Greeks abandoned him, before going back to him for help later during the attack on Troy.{{sfn|Thorburn Jr.|2005|p=433\u2013434|ps=}} [[Athenaeus]] quoted Nymphodorus's remarks on the beauty of the women of Tenedos.{{sfn|Cramer|1832|p=113|ps=}}\n\n[[Callimachus]] talked of a myth in which Ino's son Melikertes washed up dead in Tenedos after being thrown into the sea by his mother, who killed herself too; the residents, Lelegians, built an altar for Melikertes and started a ritual of a woman sacrificing her infant child when the town's need was dire. The woman would then be blinded.{{sfn|Pache|2004|ps=}} The myths also added that the custom was abolished when Orestes' descendants settled the place.{{sfn|Hughes|1991|p=86|ps=}}\n\n[[Neoptolemus]] stayed two days at Tenedos, following the advice of [[Thetis]], before he go to the land of the [[Molossians]] together with Helenus.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/150#e.6.12 Apollodorus, Library, e.6.12]</ref>\n\n===Archaic period===\nIt was at Tenedos, along with Lesbos, that the first coins with Greek writing on them were minted.{{sfn|Rose|2008|ps=}} Figures of bunches of grapes and wine vessels such as [[amphorae]] and [[Kantharos|kantharoi]] were stamped on coins.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=338|ps=}} The very first coins had a twin head of a male and a female on the obverse side.{{sfnm|1a1=Hands|1y=1907|1p=58|2a1=Ridgeway|2y=1892|2p=318|ps=}} The early coins were of silver and had a double-headed axe imprinted on them. [[Aristotle]] considered the axe as symbolizing the decapitation of those convicted of adultery, a Tenedian decree.{{sfn|Ridgeway|1892|p=318|ps=}} The axe-head was either a religious symbol or the seal of a trade unit of currency.{{sfn|Hands|1907|p=58|ps=}} Apollo Smintheus, a god who both protected against and brought about plague, was worshipped in late Bronze Age Tenedos.{{sfnm|1a1=Wood|1y=1996|1p=234||2a1=Farnell|2y=1907|ps=}} [[Strabo]]'s Geography writes that Tenedos \"contains an [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] city and has two harbours, and a temple of Apollo Smintheus\" ([[Geographica|Strabo's Geography, Vol. 13]]). The relationship between Tenedos and Apollo is mentioned in Book I of the Iliad where a priest calls to Apollo with the name \"O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might\"(''[[Iliad]]'' I).{{sfn|Price|2006|ps=}}\n\nDuring the later part of the Bronze Age and during the [[Iron Age]], the place served as a major point between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' mentions the Tenedos of this era. The culture and artisanship of the area, as represented by pottery and metal vessels recovered from graves, matched that of the northeastern Aegean. Archaeologists have found no evidence to substantiate Herodotus's assertion Aeolians had settled in Tenedos by the Bronze Age. Homer mentions Tenedos as a base for the Achaean fleet during the Trojan war.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|p=120|ps=}}\n\nThe Iron Age settlement of the northeast Aegean was once attributed to Aeolians, descendants of [[Orestes]] and hence of the [[House of Atreus]] in [[Mycenae]], from across the Aegean from [[Thessaly]], [[Boiotia]] and [[Akhaia]], all in mainland Greece. [[Pindar]], in his 11th Nemean Ode, hints at a group of [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesians]], the children of the fighters at Troy, occupying Tenedos, with Orestes, the son of [[Agamemnon]], landing straight on the island; specifically he refers to a Spartan Peisandros and his descendant Aristagoras, with Peisandaros having come over with Orestes. [[Strabo]] places the start of the migration sixty years after the Trojan war, initiated by Orestes's son, Penthilos, with the colonization continuing onto Penthilos's grandson.{{sfn|Rose|2008|ps=}}\n\nThe archaeological record provides no supporting evidence for the theory of Aiolian occupation. During the pre-archaic period, adults in Lesbos were buried by placing them in large jars, and later clay coverings were used, similar to Western [[Asia Minor]]. Still later, Tenedians began to both bury and cremate their adults in pits buttressed with stone along the walls. Children were still buried covered in jars. Some items buried with the person, such as pottery, gifts and safety-pin-like clasps, resemble what is found in Anatolia, in both style and drawings and pictures, more than they resemble burial items in mainland Greece.{{sfn|Rose|2008|ps=}}\n\nWhile human, specifically infant, sacrifice has been mentioned in connection with Tenedos's ancient past, it is now considered mythical in nature. The hero Paleomon in Tenedos was worshipped by a cult in that island, and the sacrifices were attributed to the cult.{{sfn|Hughes|1991|p=134|ps=}} At Tenedos, people did sacrifice a newborn calf dressed in [[buskins]], after treating the cow like a pregnant women giving birth; the person who killed the calf was then stoned and driven out into a life on the sea.{{sfn|Hughes|1991|p=86|ps=}} Per [[Harold Willoughby]], a belief in the calf as a ritual incarnation of God drove this practice.{{sfn|Willoughby|1929|ps=}}\n\n=== Classical period ===\nFrom the Archaic to Classical period, the archaeological evidence of well-stocked graves establishes Tenedos's continuing affluence. Tall, broad-mouthed containers show grapes and olives were likely processed during this time. They were also used to bury dead infants. By the fourth century BC, grapes and wine had become relevant to the economy of the island. Tenedians likely exported surplus wine. Writings from this era talk of a shortage of agricultural land, indicating a booming settlement. A dispute with the neighboring island of [[Sigeum]] was arbitrated by Periander of [[Corinth]], who handed over political control of a swath of the mainland to Tenedos. In the first century BC this territory was eventually incorporated into [[Alexandria Troas]].{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|pp=121\u2013122|ps=}}\n\nAccording to some accounts, [[Thales]] of Greece died in Tenedos. [[Cleostratus]], an astronomer, lived and worked in Tenedos, though it is unknown whether he met Thales there. Cleostratus is one of the founders of Greek astronomy, influenced as it was by the reception of Babylonian knowledge.{{sfn|Sarton|1952|p=178|ps=}} Athens had a naval base on the island in the fifth and fourth century BC. [[Demosthenes]] mentions [[Apollodorus of Acharnae|Apollodorus]], a [[trierarch]] commanding a ship, talking of buying food during a stopover at Tenedos where he would pass the trierarchy to Polycles.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}} In 493 BCE, the Persians overran Tenedos along with other Greek islands.{{sfn|Sarton|1952|p=222|ps=}} During his reign, [[Philip II of Macedon]], father of Alexander the Great, sent a Macedonian force sailing against the Persian fleet. Along with other Aegean islands such as Lesbos, Tenedos also rebelled against the Persian dominance at this time.{{sfn|Ashley|1998|pp=161\u2013162|ps=}} Athens seemingly augmented its naval base with a fleet at the island around 450 BC.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}}\n\nDuring the campaign of Alexander the Great against the Persians, [[Pharnabazus, son of Artabazus|Pharnabazus]], the Persian commander, laid siege to Tenedos with a hundred ships and eventually captured it as Alexander could not send a fleet in time to save the island. The island's walls were demolished and the islanders had to accept the old treaty with the Persian emperor [[Artaxerxes II]]: the Peace of Antalcidas.{{sfn|Ashley|1998|pp=106\u2013107|ps=}} Later, Alexander's commander [[Hegelochus of Macedon]] captured the island from the Persians.{{sfn|Ashley|1998|p=95|ps=}} Alexander made an alliance with the people in Tenedos in order to limit the Persian naval power.{{sfn|Engels|1980|ps=}} He also took on board 3000 Greek mercenaries and oarsmen from Tenedos in his army and navy.{{sfn|Ashley|1998|p=50|ps=}}\n\nThe land was not suitable for large-scale grazing or extensive agriculture. Local grapes and wines were mentioned in inscriptions and on coins. But Pliny and other contemporary writers did not mention grapes and wines at the island. Most exports were via sea, and both necessities and luxuries had to imported, again by sea.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}} Unlike in Athens, it is unclear whether Tenedos ever had a democracy.{{sfn|Quinn|1971|ps=}} [[Marjoram]] (Oregano) from Tenedos was one of the relishes used in Greek cuisine.{{sfn|Michell|1940|p=233|ps=}}\nThe Tenedians punished adulterers by cutting off their heads with an axe.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1839|p=236|ps=}} Aristotle wrote about the social and political structure of Tenedos.{{sfn|Cramer|1832|p=112|ps=}} He found it notable a large part of the populace worked in occupations related to ferries, possibly hundreds in a population of thousands.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}} [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] noted some common proverbs in Greek originated from customs of the Tenedians. \"He is a man of Tenedos\" was used to allude to a person of unquestionable integrity, and \"to cut with the Tenedian axe\" was a full and final 'no'.{{sfn|Disraeli|Disraeli|1859|p=57|ps=}} Lykophron, writing in the second century BC, referred to the deity Melikertes as the \"baby-slayer\".{{sfn|Pache|2004|ps=}} [[Xenophon]] described the [[Spartiate|Spartans]]' sacking the place in 389 BC, but being beaten back by an [[Athens|Athenian]] fleet when trying again two years later.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}}\n\nIn [[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]] writes that the astronomer Kleostratos ({{lang-grc|\u039a\u03bb\u03b5\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}) was from Tenedos.<ref>[https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante06/Skylax/sky_p070.html Pseudo Scylax, Periplus, \u00a795]</ref>\n\n=== [[Hellenistic period]] ===\n\nIn the Hellenistic period, the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]] was also worshipped at Tenedos. There she was associated closely with the sun, with her name and title reflecting that position.{{sfn|Witt|1971|ps=}}\n\n=== Roman period ===\nDuring the Roman occupation of Greece, Tenedos too came under their rule. The island became a part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC, when [[Attalus III]], the king of Pergamon, died, leaving his territory to the Romans.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}} The Romans constructed a new port at [[Alexandria Troas]], on the Dardanelle Strait. This led to Tenedos's decline.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=332|ps=}} Tenedos lost its importance during this period. [[Virgil]], in ''[[Aeneid]]'', stated the harbour was deserted and ships could not moor in the bay during his time. Processing of grapes seems to have been abandoned. Olive cultivation and processing did possibly continue, though there was likely no surplus to export.

The mint continued with the old designs, improving on detail and precision.{{sfn|Cook|1903|p=535|ps=}} [[Cicero]], writing in this era, noted the temple built to honor Tenes, the founder whose name the island received, and of the harsh justice system of the populace.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}}\n\n=== Byzantine period ===\nWhen [[Constantinople]] became a prominent city in the [[Roman Empire]], from AD 350 on, Tenedos became a crucial trading post. Emperor [[Justinian I]] ordered the construction of a large granary on Tenedos and ferries between the island and Constantinople became a major activity on the island.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|ps=}} Ships carrying grain from Egypt to Constantinople stopped at Tenedos when the sea was unfavorable. The countryside was likely not heavily populated or utilized. There were vineyards, orchards and corn fields, at time abandoned due to disputes.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|p=123|ps=}}\n\nThe [[Orthodox Church]] placed the diocese of Tenedos under the metropolitanate of Mytilini during the ninth century, and promoted it to its own metropolitanate in early fourteenth century.{{sfn|Kiminas|2009|p=67|ps=}} By this time Tenedos was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] but its location made it a key target of the [[Venice|Venetians]], the [[Genoa|Genoese]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The weakened Byzantine Empire and wars between Genoa and Venice for trade routes made Tenedos a key strategic location.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|ps=}} In 1304, [[Andrea Morisco]], a Genoese adventurer, backed by a title from the Byzantine emperor [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]], took over Tenedos.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=222|ps=}} Later, sensing political tension in the Byzantine empire just before the [[Byzantine civil war of 1352\u20131357|Second Byzantine Civil War]], the Venetians offered 20,000 ducats in 1350 to [[John V Palaiologos]] for control of Tenedos.

The [[baillie]] of Tenedos, Zanachi Mudazzo, refused to evacuate the place, and the [[Doge]] of Venice, Antonio Venier, protested the expulsion. The senators of Venice reaffirmed the treaty, the proposed solution of handing the island back to the Emperor seen as unacceptable to the Genoese. Toward the end of 1383, the population of almost 4000 was shipped out to [[Euboea]] and [[Crete]]. Buildings on the island were then razed leaving it empty. Venetians continued to use the harbor.{{sfn|Nicol|1992|pp=318\u2013319|ps=}}\n\nThe Venetians were zealous guarding the right to Tenedos the Treaty of Turin provided them.

Sheep and goats are grazed at hilly northeastern and southeastern part of the island which is not suitable for agriculture.{{sfn|Takao\u011flu|Bamyac\u0131|2007|p=115\u2013116|ps=}} The number of farmers involved in grape cultivation has gone up from 210 to 397 in the recent years, though the farm area has gone down from {{convert|1800|ha|km2}} to {{convert|1200|ha|km2}}.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=339|ps=}}\n\nTourism has been an important, but limited, economic activity since the 1970s but it developed rapidly from the 1990s onwards.{{sfn|Parla|2012|ps=}} The island's main attraction is the castle last rebuilt in 1815, illuminated at night, and with a view out to the open sea.{{sfn|Rutherford|2011|p=189-192|ps=}} The public is not usually allowed into either the castle{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or the Greek church. The island's past is captured in a small museum, with a room dedicated to its Greek story.{{sfn|Yale|2012|ps=}} The town square boasts a \"morning market\" where fresh groceries and seafood are sold, along with the island's specialty of tomato jam. Mainlanders from Istanbul run some bars, boutiques and guesthouses.{{sfn|Rutherford|2011|p=189-192|ps=}}  In 2010, the island was named the world's second most-beautiful island by [[Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications|Cond\u00e9 Nast]]'s Reader Choice award.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=340|ps=}} The next year, the island topped the reader's list in the same magazine for the top 10 islands in Europe.{{sfn|Top 10 Islands in Europe|2011|ps=}} In 2012, Cond\u00e9 Nast again selected Bozcaada as one of the 8 best islands in the world on account of its remnants of ancient buildings, less-crowded beaches, and places to stay.{{sfn|Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler: Reader's Choice Awards|2012|ps=}}\n\nFishing plays a role in the island's economy,{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=341|ps=}} but similar to other Aegean islands, agriculture is a more significant economic activity.{{sfn|Acer|2003|p=10|ps=}} The local fishing industry is small, with the port authority counting 48 boats and 120 fishermen in 2011. Local fishing is year-round and seafood can be obtained in all seasons. The fish population has gone down over the years, resulting in a shrinking fishing industry, though increase in tourism and consequent demand for more seafood has benefited the industry. The sea off the island is one of the major routes by which fish in the Aegen sea migrate seasonally. During the migration period, boats from the outside come to the island for fishing.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|p=341|ps=}}\n\nIn 2000, a [[wind farm]] of 17 turbines was erected at the western cape.{{sfn|Bozcaada Wind Farm|ps=}} It has a nominal power capacity of 10.2 MW energy, and produces 30 GWh of electricity every year.{{sfn|Ozerdem|Turkeli|2005|ps=}} This is much more than what the island needs, and the excess is transferred to mainland [[Anatolia]] through an underground and partly undersea cable. Overhead cables and pylons were avoided for esthetic reasons, preserving the scenic view.{{sfn|Bozcaada Wind Farm|ps=}} The land has an average wind speed of 6.4&nbsp;m/s and a mean energy density of 324&nbsp;W/<sup>m</sup>at its meteorological station. This indicates significant wind energy generation potential.{{sfnm|1a1=Gungor|1y=2012|2a1=\u0130ncec\u0130k|2a2=Erdo\u011fmu\u015f|2y=1995|ps=}}\n\nA United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) project, the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies (ICHET) set up an experimental renewables-hydrogen energy facility at the Bozcaada Governor's building on 7 October 2011. The project, supported by the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR), is the first of its kind in the country. The power plant produces energy via a 20&nbsp;kW solar photovoltaic array, and uses a 50&nbsp;kW electrolyzer to store this energy as hydrogen. A fuel cell and hydrogen engine can convert this stored energy back into electricity when needed, and the experimental system can supply up to 20 households for a day.{{sfn|First hydrogen energy production on a Turkish Island has started on Bozcaada|2011|ps=}}\n\n{{As of|2011}}, the town's hospital and governor's mansion were the only two buildings in the world using hydrogen energy. A boat and a golf cart are also powered by the same system. At the governor's place, energy is captured with a rooftop 20&nbsp;Kw solar array and a 30&nbsp;Kw wind mill. The electricity produced is used to electrolyze water into hydrogen. This gas is stored compressed, and can be used later to generate energy or as fuel in hydrogen-powered cars.  In June 2011, Henry Puna, the [[Prime Minister of the Cook Islands|Prime Minister]] of the [[Cook Islands]] traveled to Tenedos to investigate how the island uses hydrogen energy.{{sfn|Harte|2011|ps=}}\n\nIn 2012, the Turkish government opened a customs office on the island, possibly opening the way for future direct travel between Greek ports and the island.{{sfn|Tsolakidou|2012|ps=}}\n\n==Wine production==\n\nThe island is windy throughout the year and this makes the climate dry and warm enough to grow grapes.{{sfn|Parla|2012|ps=}} In classical antiquity wine production was linked with the cult of [[Dionysus]], while grapes were also depicted in the local currency. The local wine culture outlived the Ottoman period.{{sfn|Manheim|1996|ps=}} [[Vineyards]] have existed on the island since antiquity and today occupy one-third of the total land of the island and 80% of its agricultural land,{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|ps=}} In the mid-1800s, the island exported 800,000 barrels of wine annually and was revered as the best wine in the Eastern Mediterranean.{{sfn|Morewood|1838|ps=}} Ottoman traveler [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] wrote in the 16th century that the finest wines in the world were being produced in Tenedos.{{sfn|Madd River Designs|ps=}} Today, the island is one of the major [[Turkish wine|wine producing areas in Turkey]] and grows four local strains of grape: \u00c7avu\u015f, Karasak\u0131z (Kuntra), Altinba\u015f (Vasilaki), and Karalahna. However, in recent years traditional French varieties have increased in prominence, namely [[Cabernet Sauvignon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Akp\u0131nar|1a2=Sayg\u0131n|1a3=Karakaya|1y=2011|2a1=Parla|2y=2012|ps=}}\n\nPrior to 1923, wine production on the island was exclusively done by the Greek population; however, after this point, Turkish domestic wine production increased and Greeks on the island taught the Turkish population how to manufacture wine.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|ps=}} By 1980, there were 13 wine production plants on the island.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|ps=}} High taxes caused many of these to go out of business until 2001 when the state decreased taxes on wine and subsidized some of the producers on the island.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|ps=}} In recent years, newer producers have relied upon Italian and French experts to improve production.{{sfn|Parla|2012|ps=}} In 2010, the island produced a record 5,000 tons of wine.{{sfn|Akp\u0131nar|Sayg\u0131n|Karakaya|2011|ps=}} Corvus has introduced modern wine making techniques to Tenedos.{{sfn|Parla|2012|ps=}} Grape harvest festivities are held the first week of September annually.{{sfn|BA\u011e BOZUMU FEST\u0130VAL\u0130|ps=}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\nThe main transportation from mainland Turkey is by ferries from [[Geyikli]] and from the town of [[\u00c7anakkale]].{{sfn|Rutherford|2009|ps=}} The island is roughly {{convert|5|km}} from mainland Turkey.{{sfn|Acer|2003|p=260|ps=}} From the Geyikli pier, ferry travel is available for both passengers and automobiles, and takes about 35 minutes.  A passenger-only ferry service from \u00c7anakkale began running in 2009.

It was founded in 1914 as a citizens' university, which means it was founded and funded by the wealthy and active liberal citizenry of Frankfurt. The original name was '''Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt am Main'''. In 1932, the university's name was extended in honour of one of the most famous native sons of Frankfurt, the poet, philosopher and writer/dramatist [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. The university currently has around 45,000 students, distributed across four major campuses within the city.\n\nThe university celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2014.

Merged with other collections, it was renamed City Library in 1668 and became the university library in 1914. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/ueber/stub_geschichte.html|title=Geschichte der Stadt- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek|website=www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref> Depending on the country, the date of foundation is recorded differently. According to Anglo-American calculations, the founding date of Goethe University would be 1484. In Germany, the date on which the right to award doctorates is granted is considered the founding year of a university.\n\nThe university has been best known historically for its [[Institute for Social Research]] (founded 1924), the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]], a preeminent 20th century school of [[philosophy]] and social thought. Some of the well-known scholars associated with this school include [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], as well as [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Erich Fromm]], and [[Walter Benjamin]] {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Other well-known scholars at the University of Frankfurt include the sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]], the philosopher [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], the philosophers of religion [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Martin Buber]], and [[Paul Tillich]], the psychologist [[Max Wertheimer]], and the sociologist [[Norbert Elias]] {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}.\nThe University of Frankfurt has at times been considered liberal, or left-leaning, and has had a reputation for [[Jew]]ish and [[Marxist]] (or even Jewish-Marxist) scholarship {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] period, \"almost one third of its academics and many of its students were dismissed for racial and/or political reasons\u2014more than at any other German university\" {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. The university also played a major part in the [[German student movement]] of 1968.\n\nThe university also has been influential in the natural sciences and medicine, with Nobel Prize winners including [[Max von Laue]] and [[Max Born]], and breakthroughs such as the [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]].\n\nIn recent years, the university has focused in particular on law, history, and economics, creating new institutes, such as the [[Institute for Law and Finance]] (ILF) and the [[Center for Financial Studies]] (CFS) {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. One of the university's ambitions is to become Germany's leading university for finance and economics, given the school's proximity to one of Europe's financial centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.uni-frankfurt.de/master/presse/178.pdf |title=Die Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t auf dem Weg zur f\u00fchrenden Wirtschaftshochschule in Deutschland |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26}}</ref> In cooperation with [[Duke University]]\u2019s [[Fuqua School of Business]], the [[Goethe Business School]] offers an [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] program.

On 30 May 2008, the [[House of Finance]] relocated to a new building designed by the architects Kleihues+Kleihues, following the style of the IG Farben Building. The upper floors of the House of Finance building have several separate offices as well as shared office space for researchers and students. The ground floor is open to the public and welcomes visitors with a spacious, naturally lit foyer that leads to lecture halls, seminar rooms, and the information center, a 24-hour reference library. The ground floor also accommodates computer rooms and a caf\u00e9. The floors, walls and ceiling of the foyer are decorated with a grid design that is continued throughout the entire building. The flooring is inspired by Raphael's mural, ''The School of Athens''.\n\n==Goethe Business School==\nThe [[Goethe Business School]] is a graduate business school at the university, established in 2004, part of the House of Finance at the Westend Campus and the IKB building. it is a non-profit foundation under private law held by the university.

It was founded in 1914 as a citizens' university, which means it was founded and funded by the wealthy and active liberal citizenry of Frankfurt. The original name was '''Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt am Main'''. In 1932, the university's name was extended in honour of one of the most famous native sons of Frankfurt, the poet, philosopher and writer/dramatist [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. The university currently has around 45,000 students, distributed across four major campuses within the city.\n\nThe university celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2014. The first female president of the university, [[Birgitta Wolff]], was sworn into office in 2015.<ref name=\"Neue Uni-Pr\u00e4sidentin will kommunikativen F\u00fchrungsstil\">{{cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/frankfurt-neue-uni-praesidentin-birgitta-wolff-will-kommunikativen-fuehrungsstil-13319493.html|title=Neue Uni-Pr\u00e4sidentin will kommunikativen F\u00fchrungsstil|accessdate=2015-03-03|newspaper=Faz.net}}</ref> 20 [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|Nobel Prize winners]] have been [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation#Other universities|affiliated with the university]], including [[Max von Laue]] and [[Max Born]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1914/laue.html|title=Nobel prize Physics laureates}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/39246655/nobelpreis?|title=Goethe-Universit\u00e4t \u2014 Nobelpreistr\u00e4ger an der Goethe Universit\u00e4t|website=www.uni-frankfurt.de|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref> The university is also affiliated with 18 winners of the prestigious [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/39246641/leibnizpreis?|title=Goethe-Universit\u00e4t \u2014 Leibnizpreistr\u00e4ger an der Goethe-Universit\u00e4t|website=www.uni-frankfurt.de|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\nGoethe University is part of the [[IT cluster Rhine-Main-Neckar]].

Merged with other collections, it was renamed City Library in 1668 and became the university library in 1914. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/ueber/stub_geschichte.html|title=Geschichte der Stadt- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek|website=www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref> Depending on the country, the date of foundation is recorded differently. According to Anglo-American calculations, the founding date of Goethe University would be 1484. In Germany, the date on which the right to award doctorates is granted is considered the founding year of a university.\n\nThe university has been best known historically for its [[Institute for Social Research]] (founded 1924), the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]], a preeminent 20th century school of [[philosophy]] and social thought. Some of the well-known scholars associated with this school include [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], as well as [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Erich Fromm]], and [[Walter Benjamin]] {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Other well-known scholars at the University of Frankfurt include the sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]], the philosopher [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], the philosophers of religion [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Martin Buber]], and [[Paul Tillich]], the psychologist [[Max Wertheimer]], and the sociologist [[Norbert Elias]] {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}.\nThe University of Frankfurt has at times been considered liberal, or left-leaning, and has had a reputation for [[Jew]]ish and [[Marxist]] (or even Jewish-Marxist) scholarship {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] period, \"almost one third of its academics and many of its students were dismissed for racial and/or political reasons\u2014more than at any other German university\" {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. The university also played a major part in the [[German student movement]] of 1968.\n\nThe university also has been influential in the natural sciences and medicine, with Nobel Prize winners including [[Max von Laue]] and [[Max Born]], and breakthroughs such as the [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]].\n\nIn recent years, the university has focused in particular on law, history, and economics, creating new institutes, such as the [[Institute for Law and Finance]] (ILF) and the [[Center for Financial Studies]] (CFS) {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. One of the university's ambitions is to become Germany's leading university for finance and economics, given the school's proximity to one of Europe's financial centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.uni-frankfurt.de/master/presse/178.pdf |title=Die Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t auf dem Weg zur f\u00fchrenden Wirtschaftshochschule in Deutschland |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26}}</ref> In cooperation with [[Duke University]]\u2019s [[Fuqua School of Business]], the [[Goethe Busines School]] offers an [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] program.

On 30 May 2008, the [[House of Finance]] relocated to a new building designed by the architects Kleihues+Kleihues, following the style of the IG Farben Building. The upper floors of the House of Finance building have several separate offices as well as shared office space for researchers and students. The ground floor is open to the public and welcomes visitors with a spacious, naturally lit foyer that leads to lecture halls, seminar rooms, and the information center, a 24-hour reference library. The ground floor also accommodates computer rooms and a caf\u00e9. The floors, walls and ceiling of the foyer are decorated with a grid design that is continued throughout the entire building. The flooring is inspired by Raphael's mural, ''The School of Athens''.\n\n==Goethe Business School==\nThe [[Goethe Business School]] is a graduate business school at the university, established in 2004, part of the House of Finance at the Westend Campus and the IKB building. it is a non-profit foundation under private law held by the university.
