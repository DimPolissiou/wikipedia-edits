The closely massed, British troops broke and ran when the Mysore army laid down a rocket barrage in their midst.]]\n\n[[Mysorean rockets]] were the first iron-cased rockets that were successfully deployed for military use. [[Hyder Ali]], the 18th century ruler of Mysore, and his son and successor, [[Tippu Sultan]] used them effectively against the British East India Company. Tipu Sultan's military manual (called ''[[Fathul Mujahidin]]'') even advocated that 200 rocket men should be assigned to each Mysorean ''Kushoon'' (brigade). These rocket men were also trained to launch the rockets. In addition, wheeled rocket launchers capable of launching five to ten rockets almost simultaneously were used in war.\n\nIt was the world's first use of rockets for fighting modern wars. The British successfully reverse engineered and developed this rocket technology further (''See [[Congreve rocket]]''). After India was conquered, scientific research and development was constrained to further the British interests and military science in India naturally lagged.\n\n=== Post-Independent India ===\nDemocratic India's missile programme dates back to the late 1950s, when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was the Prime Minister of India and Dr. D. S. Kothari was the Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister. In 1958, the government of India constituted a team of Indian scientists - called the Special Weapons Development Team - to research guided missile weapons development.\n\nMotivated to strengthen its defences after the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and the prevailing international scenario of the time, the government of [[History of the Republic of India|independent India]] renewed its focus on Indian missile technology development. Initially, the scientists of the Special Weapons Development Team worked from MetCalfe House (New Delhi), but the establishment later shifted to Hyderabad after the state government granted them the former Nizam's army barracks. This was the genesis of the '''Defence Research and Development Laboratory''' (DRDL) \u2013 earlier known as the '''Special Weapons Development Team''' \u2013 under [[DRDO]], solely formed for missile technology research and development.<ref name=\"fl-missile-shield\">{{cite news\n |last        = T.

The project laid the foundation of India's missile programme and many from this group who were involved in the development of the anti-tank missile to be used in [[BMP-2|Sarath ICVs]] manufactured at [[Ordnance Factory Medak]], went on to set up the [[Bharat Dynamics Limited]] (BDL), Hyderabad in the proximity of the ordnance factory, which became the production agency of missiles in India. (In the 1970s, SS-11B anti-tank missiles were manufactured under license from France at the BDL.)\n\nAs Indian science and technology was curtailed before it became independent, and missile technology had developed at a fast pace after the second world war, India decided to update itself on missile technology by reverse engineering a surface-to-air missile. This project was code-named [[Project Devil]] and it worked, from 1970 to 1979, on reverse engineering the Russian SAM-2 (which Russia supplied to India). Dr. B. D. Nag Chaudhri (then Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister) advocated the need to build technologies needed for the future, such as liquid propellant powered engines. Thus, a parallel program called [[Project Valiant]] was also initiated to build a rocket engine powered by liquid propellants. [[V. K. Saraswat]] was part of the team that built the engine between 1971 \u2013 1974.\n\nOther scientists at DRDO simultaneously focused on building a guidance package \u2013 an essential part of a long-range missile that determines its path and accuracy to hit a target. A platform-based inertial navigation system (INS) was developed and tested, on board an Avro aircraft, in 1974\u201375. Subsequently, an INS was built for both missiles and an aircraft, and this was tested in 1979 on board a Canberra aircraft.\n\nBy the start of 1980's, DRDL had developed competencies in the fields of propulsion, navigation and manufacture of materials. Thus, India's political and scientific leadership, which included prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]], Defence Minister R. Venkataraman, V.S. Arunachalam (Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister), decided that all these technologies should be consolidated.\n\nThis led to the birth of the [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Program]] and [[Abdul Kalam|Dr. Abdul Kalam]], who had previously been the project director for the SLV-3 programme at [[ISRO]], was inducted as the DRDL Director in 1983 to conceive and lead it. He decided that DRDL would pursue multiple projects in this area simultaneously. Thus, four projects were born under the [[IGMDP]]:\n\n* Short range surface-to-surface missile (code-named [[Prithvi (missile)|Prithvi]])\n* Short range low-level surface-to-air missile (code-named [[Trishul missile|Trishul]])\n* Medium range surface-to-air missile (code-named [[Akash (missile)|Akash]]) and\n* Third-generation anti-tank missile (code-named [[Nag (missile)|Nag]]).\n\nThe [[Agni (missile)|Agni missile]] was initially conceived in the [[IGMDP]] as a technology demonstrator project in the form of a re-entry vehicle, and was later upgraded to a ballistic missile with different ranges.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Integrated Guided Missile Development Program\n |url         = http://brahmos.com/content.php?id=10&sid=25\n |accessdate  = 7 June 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120321081536/http://brahmos.com/content.php?id=10&sid=25\n |archivedate = 21 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> As part of this program, the [[Interim Test Range]] at Balasore in Orissa was also developed for missile testing.<ref name=\"fl-missile-shield\" />\n\n=== Diplomatic and Technological Hurdles ===\nAfter India test-fired the first Prithvi missile in 1988, and the Agni missile in 1989, the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] (then an informal grouping established in 1987 by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) decided to restrict access to any technology that would help India in its missile development program. Some of the major technology which was denied, included:\n\n* phase shifters for the phased array radars for Akash (denied by the USA).\n* magnesium alloy used in Prithvi's wings (denied by Germany).\n* servo-valves needed for the electro-hydraulic control systems of Agni and Prithvi.\n* gyroscopes and accelerometers (denied by France).\n* processors \u2013 [[Intel]] said it would not give India chips for the computers used in Prithvi and Agni.\n\nTo counter the [[MTCR]], the [[IGMDP]] team formed a consortium of [[DRDO]] laboratories, industries and academic institutions to build these sub-systems, components and materials. Though this slowed down the progress of the program, India successfully developed indigenously all the restricted components denied to it by the [[MTCR]].<ref name=\"fl-missile-shield\" />\n\nIn 2011, the DRDO Chief V K Saraswat had stated that \"indigenous content\" in India's strategic missiles had gone up to such a level, with ring-laser gyros, composite rocket motors, micro-navigation systems etc., that \"no technology control regime\" could derail them any longer.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Pandit\n | first = Rajat\n | title = Eyeing China, India to enter ICBM club in 3 months\n | newspaper = The Times of India\n | location = India\n | date = 17 November 2011\n | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-17/india/30409335_1_agni-v-agni-iv-agni-programme-director\n | accessdate=31 May 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n== Indian Missile Projects ==\n\n=== Project Devil ===\n{{main|Project Devil}}\n'''Project Devil''' was one of two early [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fuelled missile]] projects developed by India, along with [[Project Valiant]], in the 1970s.

The closely massed, British troops broke and ran when the Mysore army laid down a rocket barrage in their midst.]]\n\n[[Mysorean rockets]] were the first iron-cased rockets that were successfully deployed for military use. [[Hyder Ali]], the 18th century ruler of Mysore, and his son and successor, [[Tippu Sultan]] used them effectively against the British East India Company. Tipu Sultan's military manual (called ''[[Fathul Mujahidin]]'') even advocated that 200 rocket men should be assigned to each Mysorean ''Kushoon'' (brigade). These rocket men were also trained to launch the rockets. In addition, wheeled rocket launchers capable of launching five to ten rockets almost simultaneously were used in war.\n\nIt was the world's first use of rockets for fighting modern wars. The British successfully reverse engineered and developed this rocket technology further (''See [[Congreve rocket]]''). After India was conquered, scientific research and development was constrained to further the British interests and military science in India naturally lagged.\n\n=== Post-Independent India ===\nDemocratic India's missile programme dates back to the late 1950s, when [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was the Prime Minister of India and Dr. D. S. Kothari was the Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister. In 1958, the government of India constituted a team of Indian scientists - called the Special Weapons Development Team - to research guided missile weapons development.\n\nMotivated to strengthen its defences after the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and the prevailing international scenario of the time, the government of [[History of the Republic of India|independent India]] renewed its focus on Indian missile technology development. Initially, the scientists of the Special Weapons Development Team worked from MetCalfe House (New Delhi), but the establishment later shifted to Hyderabad after the state government granted them the former Nizam's army barracks. This was the genesis of the '''Defence Research and Development Laboratory''' (DRDL) \u2013 earlier known as the '''Special Weapons Development Team''' \u2013 under [[DRDO]], solely formed for missile technology research and development.<ref name=\"fl-missile-shield\">{{cite news\n |last        = T.

The project laid the foundation of India's missile programme and many from this group who were involved in the development of the anti-tank missile to be used in [[BMP-2|Sarath ICVs]] manufactured at [[Ordnance Factory Medak]], went on to set up the [[Bharat Dynamics Limited]] (BDL), Hyderabad in the proximity of the ordnance factory, which became the production agency of missiles in India. (In the 1970s, SS-11B anti-tank missiles were manufactured under license from France at the BDL.)\n\nAs Indian science and technology was curtailed before it became independent, and missile technology had developed at a fast pace after the second world war, India decided to update itself on missile technology by reverse engineering a surface-to-air missile. This project was code-named [[Project Devil]] and it worked, from 1970 to 1979, on reverse engineering the Russian SAM-2 (which Russia supplied to India). Dr. B. D. Nag Chaudhri (then Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister) advocated the need to build technologies needed for the future, such as liquid propellant powered engines. Thus, a parallel program called [[Project Valiant]] was also initiated to build a rocket engine powered by liquid propellants. [[V. K. Saraswat]] was part of the team that built the engine between 1971 \u2013 1974.\n\nOther scientists at DRDO simultaneously focused on building a guidance package \u2013 an essential part of a long-range missile that determines its path and accuracy to hit a target. A platform-based inertial navigation system (INS) was developed and tested, on board an Avro aircraft, in 1974\u201375. Subsequently, an INS was built for both missiles and an aircraft, and this was tested in 1979 on board a Canberra aircraft.\n\nBy the start of 1980's, DRDL had developed competencies in the fields of propulsion, navigation and manufacture of materials. Thus, India's political and scientific leadership, which included prime minister [[Indira Gandhi]], Defence Minister R. Venkataraman, V.S. Arunachalam (Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister), decided that all these technologies should be consolidated.\n\nThis led to the birth of the [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Program]] and [[Abdul Kalam|Dr. Abdul Kalam]], who had previously been the project director for the SLV-3 programme at [[ISRO]], was inducted as the DRDL Director in 1983 to conceive and lead it. He decided that DRDL would pursue multiple projects in this area simultaneously. Thus, four projects were born under the [[IGMDP]]:\n\n* Short range surface-to-surface missile (code-named [[Prithvi (missile)|Prithvi]])\n* Short range low-level surface-to-air missile (code-named [[Trishul missile|Trishul]])\n* Medium range surface-to-air missile (code-named [[Akash (missile)|Akash]]) and\n* Third-generation anti-tank missile (code-named [[Nag (missile)|Nag]]).\n\nThe [[Agni (missile)|Agni missile]] was initially conceived in the [[IGMDP]] as a technology demonstrator project in the form of a re-entry vehicle, and was later upgraded to a ballistic missile with different ranges.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Integrated Guided Missile Development Program\n |url         = http://brahmos.com/content.php?id=10&sid=25\n |accessdate  = 7 June 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120321081536/http://brahmos.com/content.php?id=10&sid=25\n |archivedate = 21 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> As part of this program, the [[Interim Test Range]] at Balasore in Orissa was also developed for missile testing.<ref name=\"fl-missile-shield\" />\n\n=== Diplomatic and Technological Hurdles ===\nAfter India test-fired the first Prithvi missile in 1988, and the Agni missile in 1989, the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] (then an informal grouping established in 1987 by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) decided to restrict access to any technology that would help India in its missile development program. Some of the major technology which was denied, included:\n\n* phase shifters for the phased array radars for Akash (denied by the USA).\n* magnesium alloy used in Prithvi's wings (denied by Germany).\n* servo-valves needed for the electro-hydraulic control systems of Agni and Prithvi.\n* gyroscopes and accelerometers (denied by France).\n* processors \u2013 [[Intel]] said it would not give India chips for the computers used in Prithvi and Agni.\n\nTo counter the [[MTCR]], the [[IGMDP]] team formed a consortium of [[DRDO]] laboratories, industries and academic institutions to build these sub-systems, components and materials. Though this slowed down the progress of the program, India successfully developed indigenously all the restricted components denied to it by the [[MTCR]].<ref name=\"fl-missile-shield\" />\n\nIn 2011, the DRDO Chief V K Saraswat had stated that \"indigenous content\" in India's strategic missiles had gone up to such a level, with ring-laser gyros, composite rocket motors, micro-navigation systems etc., that \"no technology control regime\" could derail them any longer.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Pandit\n | first = Rajat\n | title = Eyeing China, India to enter ICBM club in 3 months\n | newspaper = The Times of India\n | location = India\n | date = 17 November 2011\n | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-17/india/30409335_1_agni-v-agni-iv-agni-programme-director\n | accessdate=31 May 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n== Indian Missile Projects ==\n\n=== Project Devil ===\n{{main|Project Devil}}\n'''Project Devil''' was one of two early [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fuelled missile]] projects developed by India, along with [[Project Valiant]], in the 1970s.

Atom's first appearance in a DC comic was in ''Justice League of America'' #137, a crossover issue depicting Captain Marvel's first meeting with [[Superman]].

Atom easily withstood the efforts of the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] [[Green Lantern]]s and [[Flash (comics)|Flashes]], the god Mercury and [[Ibis the Invincible]] to subdue him, even when Brainiac's forcefield around him was turned off and Brainiac had been defeated, but when he tried to use Ibis's Ibistick to send Ibis to a faraway star, having stunned Ibis from an energy blast, he found the stick had a [[failsafe]] that caused any commands that would harm Ibis to backfire on the user, and Atom was the one propelled far into space.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #137. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nAgain Atom was brought back to Earth, this time by [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]], who employed him to attach his head to an atomic racecar and challenge Captain Marvel to an auto race in [[Indianapolis]] with the threat that he'd level the city with an atomic blast. When Captain Marvel won the race using a Shazam lightning-powered car, and destroyed Atom's car, Atom re-attached his head to his body and attacked Marvel, who hit him hard enough to achieve [[escape velocity]] and send Mister Atom into orbit around the sun. Mr Mind was meanwhile captured by Uncle Marvel using a Geiger counter.<ref>''Shazam! #33. DC Comics.</ref> Captain Marvel then threw the racer into the Sun.
