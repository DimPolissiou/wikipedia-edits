Vishwaveer discovers that an abandoned baby girl is able to protect Gauri from a familial curse, and he adopts her, naming her Kaali and making her Gauri's \"kaala teeka\".\n\n'''After 5 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Sargam Khurana]]) continues protecting Gauri ([[Adaa Narang]]) in every way. Gauri, being Vishwaveer's only child, is brought up surrounded with comforts, while Vishwaveer doesn't treat Kaali very well. She is mistreated by Vishwaveer's sister-in-law Kalyani Jha ([[Mona Ambegaonkar]]). Vishwaveer's first wife, Manjiri Jha ([[Dalljiet Kaur]]), who doesn't have children, adores Kaali and brings her up as her own daughter.\n\nKalyani plots to kill Gauri to get revenge from Vishwaveer for an old matter. She kills Kaali first, so that she is unable to protect Gauri. However, Kaali survives, and relates the incident to Manjiri, who decides to make Kalyani pay.\n\nKaali and Manjiri confront Kalyani in a temple, where Kalyani ends up killing Manjiri by strangling her, and making it look like Kaali did it. When the family finds out, Vishwaveer decides to take the blame on himself and go to jail in Kaali's place, so that Kaali can stay with Gauri and continue to protect her. As a result, Vishwaveer goes to jail for 14 years.\n\n'''After 14 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Simran Pareenja]]) and Gauri ([[Fenil Umrigar]]) are grown up. Kaali is very intelligent and a good singer, but all credits are taken by Gauri. Kaali writes exams for her and sings for her. A guy named Yug Choudhary ([[Rohan Gandotra]]) hears Kaali's voice and is taken aback by her voice. He tries to search for her but is unable to find her. Everyone thinks that it is Gauri who sings and Yug also thinks the same, but he is not able to find Gauri. Vishwaveer, while searching for a suitable groom for Gauri, comes across Yug and resolves to get her married to him. Gauri initially refuses but Kaali convinces her, and Gauri eventually falls in love with Yug and agrees for marriage after testing him a couple of times. When Yug's grandmother rejects the proposal considering Vishwa to be a criminal, he brainwashes Gauri's brother Neelkanth \"Neel\" Jha ([[Nivin Ramani]]) into trying to rape Yug's sister Sharmila Choudhary ([[Meenu Panchal]]). Neel attempts to do so, but is held back by his conscience at the last minute. In order to save Sharmila's reputation, Yug's grandmother agrees to get Yug married to Gauri in exchange for Neel marrying Sharmila. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Manjiri is still alive and that she lost her memory 14 years ago and saved Yug's life, after which his father took her in as his sister. She is now living with Yug.\n\nAfter a while Kaali finds out that Manjiri is still alive and with the help of Yug, Kaali brings her memory back. Yug-Gauri and Neel-Sharmila are now scheduled to get married. Instead destiny wants to bring Yug and Kaali together who have fallen in love. Yug is actually Kaali's childhood Ramji.\n\nThe show goes on with Manjiri and Yug supporting Kali in each and every step to get back love of Vishwaveer and prove him superstitions are waste. Gauri's kundli's truth comes out and Kaali is forced to agree to be Gauri's Kaala Teeka again and goes to Yug's house. She gets anxious and encounters Vishwa and decides to leave. Manjiri and Kali get kidnapped by Kalyani, but Yug saves them. Kalyani is arrested and Manjiri goes back to Vishwa and demands Kali and Yug's alliance. Gauri drinks poison but she is saved and Vishwa realises that it was not Kali being kaala teeka that worked for Gauri but her prayers were the ones which truly worked. He fixes Yug and Kali's alliance to which Yug's mother Leelavita \"Leela\" Choudhary agrees only because of a hidden motto and she doesn't want Kali to be her daughter-in-law. Therefore, Leela and Gauri team up. Yug marries Kali but everyone get tricked as they assume it is Gauri who is marrying Yug. Yug doesn't trust Kali anymore and goes with Gauri. Yug starts to hate Kali.\n\nTime passes by and Yug finally finds out the truth behind Gauri and marries Kali once again. Gauri then plans to make Kali seem dead by injecting some type of medicine on her but that plan fails when her injection breaks. Instead, she puts the poison in the safety pin and hooks it on Kali's doli. Kali is pricked by the safety pin. While performing rituals and praying in the temple at Yug's house, Kali faints. They call the doctor but the doctor tells everyone that Kali is dead. Just then, Yug realizes that it could have been Gauri and goes to her hotel to drag her there. She fakes and does some drama of crying and says she will bring Kali back to life by burning kapur on her hand. She has already put chemical on her hand to make sure her palm doesn't burn. The poison wears off and Kali regains conscientious, leaving everyone believing Gauri. However Yug does not believe Gauri and sends her out of the house. Gauri vows for revenge. She comes back as a servant and starts to make Leela believe that an evil spirit is haunting her. She brings a fake astrologer and he tells that Yug should be 21 kilometers away from the house. Leela and Yug believe it and Yug leaves. Later with the help of the astrologer, Gauri makes it look like Kali has the evil spirit inside her and Leela decides to sacrifice Kali. Manjiri comes to Yug's house and discovers that there is a pooja going on and asks for Kali, who is locked in a room. Manjiri gets suspicious and follows the car leading to the ashram. She brings a real astrologer and the truth behind Gauri gets revealed to everyone. Kali, enraged, slaps Gauri for her deeds and Gauri later reveals to everyone that Leela did not want Kali to be her daughter in law and encouraged Gauri that Yug would be married to her. Yug gets distraught and leaves while Gauri and the fake astrologer get arrested. Gauri vows to destroy his whole family. After three months however, Gauri who is released from jail returns and reveals to everyone that she is pregnant with Yug's child. Because of this Yug allows her to stay until the child is born. Later, it is revealed that Kaali is also pregnant. This matter however, is only known by Gauri and Vishwa as they bribed the nurse to get her reports before she does. In order to make sure that Kaali and Yug stay apart Gauri plans to have Kali thrown out of the house which is eventually carried out by Yug himself, as he does so Vishwa then takes Kaali to the top of a cliff and reveals her pregnancy to her just as he is about to push her off. Vishwa pushes Kali off of the cliff but Kali hangs onto a branch. Vishwa throws rock at her and she falls. Afterwards, Kali's suicide note comes and everyone believes Kali to be dead. Leela asks Yug to marry Gauri and give the child a legitimate name. Yug agrees to marry Gauri. Meanwhile, Kali doesn't die and is saved by a mentally challenged man named Nandu Singh ([[Mayank Gandhi]]). Kali asks Nandu to take her to Choudhary House. Nandu takes her there but returns. There back in his village, some kids tease him as Kali's husband. Nandu becomes shy and later, Nandu marries Kali and then takes her to the hospital where he gets to know that Kali is in coma.\n\n'''7 months later'''\n\nYug is now turned as a puppet for Vishwaveer. Vishwaveer is the new landlord of Choudhary House. Nandu is seen taking care of Kali in the hospital. The nurses discuss that Kali has lost her child. Gauri and Yug travel to Veerpur. On there way Gauri gets labour pain and Yug takes her to the same hospital where Kali is admitted. Vishwaveer finds out that Kali is in the hospital. Meanwhile, Gauri delivers a baby girl and names it Naina. Naina gets kidnapped by Vishwa, after being told that baby is threat to his life and Kali finds out about Yug and Gauri and decides to commit suicide on the same river where Vishwa places Naina in a basket and floating away. Kali feels the basket and finds Naina in it and decides to live. She begins to raise Naina. Unknown to Kali is that Naina is Yug and Gauri's daughter, who are distraught after their baby went missing, and names it Naina. It is revealed that Vishwa attempted to kill Naina because of a superstition that says Naina is a threat to him. Manjiri later finds Kali at a temple and Kali reveals that she was once pregnant with Yug's child and Vishwa threw her off the cliff for the sake of Gauri. Manjiri vows revenge on Vishwa and brings Kali to Yug's house. Gauri does not like this and tries to kill her own daughter Naina. However it backfires. Meanwhile, Nandu finds out that Vishwa attempted to kill Kali and vows not to spare him. Fearing that the truth would come out, Vishwa gets rid of all the evidence he could find. He also find out that Kali's adopted daughter is actually Gauri and Yug's daughter Naina. Vishwa attempts to kill Kali and Naina but fails because of Nandu. Manjiri later finds out about this and scolds Vishwa and reveals her revenge against him. Kali and Naina disappeared once again and Manjiri threatens to kill Vishwa if he does not reveal where Kali and Naina are. It is later revealed that Kali had planned this to get the truth from Vishwa. Later, while Vishwa, along with his partner Raj Purohit ([[Rajesh Puri]]) conduct a Pooja, assuming that Kali is dead, Kali pretends to be a spirit to get Vishwa to say the truth. With the help of Nandu and Manjiri, Kali gets the truth out. Yug gets distraught by hearing this and a chandelier falls on Kali. While she is hospitalized Manjiri reveals the truth behind Vishwa and Gauri. Yug later gets Raj and Vishwa arrested but they escape. Naina gets kidnapped again but Kali and Manjiri finds her. Vishwa finds Kali and Manjiri and threatens to kill Kali and Naina. Before he could, Manjiri grabs a trishul and stabs Vishwa, killing him. After Vishwa's funeral, Yug asks Kali for forgiveness but Kali rejects saying that she is not a doll to play with. Nandu offers Kali to stay at his place but Yug threatens to kill Naina if Kali leaves. Kali stays but scolds Yug for being selfish and will only stay for Naina's sake. Leela declares Kali as Naina's official mother as Gauri is too dangerous for the number of sins she committed. At this time, a tantrik named Devri Singh ([[Vineet Raina]]) is introduced and reveals to be Nandu's brother. Kali and Manjiri get suspicious about Devri and ask a priest at an ashram and Raj Purohit, as he has no other option. Manjiri and Kali discover that Devri was Vishwa's Kaala Teeka. They also discovers Devri's true intentions to kill the baby Naina to gain evil powers. It is also revealed in Nandu's kundli that Nandu is Naina's Kaala Teeka. Discovering that Devri is a threat, Yug bans Devri from coming into the house while Devri plot to kill Naina is underway. Devri also decides to kill Kali because she is an obstacle that he has to overcome to kill Naina. But Manjiri and Nandu save them and Nandu and Kali get married for Naina's protection. This infuriates Yug and he decides to kill Nandu but is stopped by Gauri. Devri decides to kill his own brother Nandu in order to get Naina but Devri mistakenly stabs himself. Devri is rushed to the hospital. Yug later snatched Naina from Kali saying that she is no longer her mother. Yug meets with an accident and Naina and Yug are hospitalized. Devri donates blood to Naina but Kali would forgive him if he goes to jail. But Devri escaped and forms another plan to kill Naina. Jamuna soon finds out about this and warns Kali. Kali decides to kill Devri. Raj Purohit later finds out that only Kali and Nandu can kill Devri. Nandu does not want to kill his brother Devri. Kali decides to kill Devri with the help of Yug and she was successful. But Devri is still alive and attempted to drown Kali but is saved by Nandu who kills his own brother Devri.\n\n'''After 8 months'''\n\nKali is now pregnant with Nandu's child and Naina is shown to be 8 months old and causing trouble for Kali, Yug and Gauri. Naina runs to a forest and Kali finds her there. while she was there, she gives birth to Nandu's child and names her Pavitra. A nearby tantrik reveals that Pavitra would not be able to live for no longer than seven years.\n\n'''5 years later'''\n\nNandu had died when he killed Devri. Yug decides to adopt Pavitra. Gauri gets jealous to Kaali because she think that Kaali was take her life. Gauri becomes angry after knowing that Kaali and Yug get closer again. She then burned the house. Everybody is dead but Kaali is trapped in her room. Naina and Pavitra was saved and they ran away from the house. Gauri chases them and wants to kill Pavitra. But fuel tank of her car was leaked and her car was exploded, Gauri dead. In the next day, Chulbuli comes home and is shocked to see the house was burned. Naina and Pavitra go back home and meet Chulbuli. They feel sad when everybody found dead. But Kaali still trapped in her room. They search Kaali and the found her, they take Kaali to hospital. Suddenly, Kaali wake up and hug Naina and Pavitra. Raj Purohit come to hospital and ask forgiveness to Kaali. Raj Purohit confess that myth about kaala teeka of Gauri is just a hoax. He made up the story about kaala teeka because he was treated by Vishwaveer. Kaali forgives him and make him promise to not tell about superstition anymore. Kaali want Chulbuli to take care of her daughter. Kaali closed her eyes and dies. A few days later, Jamuna come home and wants to take Pavitra to stay with her. Naina, Chulbuli and Pavitra herself didn't let her to take Pavitra. Chulbuli says to Raj Purohit to bring Naina and Pavitra to Neel and Sharmila in the city to avoid Jamuna. But before that happen, Jamuna comes and takes Pavitra away. Moving to Bhimpur, the bus in which they were traveling meets with an accident and Jamuna dies. Pavitra faints, falls into the river, and she floats away to another village. Maai finds her and says that she will take care of her.\n\n'''14 years later'''\n\nNaina ([[Sukirti Kandpal]]), Gauri and Yug's daughter, lives in [[Mumbai]] while Pavitra (also [[Simran Pareenja]]), Kaali and Nandu's daughter, lives in Bhimpur village. Pavitra just looks like her mother Kaali. Naina goes to college and on every holiday she goes to several villages in search of Pavitra. This time she went to Bhimpur. In Bhimpur, she stays at a girl's house called Barki, which she helped during a bus accident. Naina doesn't know that the girl in whose house she is staying is Pavitra's house. In Bhimpur, there is a ride called \"Ganga Darpan\" in which innocent girls are decked up as brides and are send to the other village, in order to do prostitution. But the villagers are not aware of this. They think that the girls are being send to an Ashram for being Sanyasi's all their lives. This all is a big sex scandal. In all of this, Thakur Dev Sinha ([[Parag Tyagi]]), the Thakur of the village and the Mahant was involved. However, Naina tried to exposed Thakur Dev and the Mahant in front of the villagers, but nobody listened to her and she was sent back to Mumbai. But Naina didn't gave up and went back to Bhimpur, this time with Chulbuli and Dimpy. There Naina meet Krishna Sinha ([[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]]), the son of Thakur Dev Sinha. There was a glimpse of love at first sight. With the help of Krishna and Barki, Naina created a plan to expose the Thakur. The 45th time Barki was chosen for the \"Ganga Darpan\" and Naina wanted to stop this and she succeeds, but Thakur Dev Sinha accused Mahant and he was sent to jail instead of both of them. Then all the girls returned to their parents. However, Thakur Dev tried to kill Naina and Krishna, but couldn't succeed. One day Mai (also Barki's mother) wanted to remove all the proof of Pavitra's existence, but could't do it because Barki got to know that she is Pavitra. Naina saves Barki and they got back to the village. Thakur Dev didn't stop his cunning and slimy tricks. He harms Naina and marries her, cheating Krishna who was about to marry Naina, in order to rape Naina, because she exposed him. Naina losts her memory. Pavitra marries Krishna to enter Thakur Dev's mansion in order to save Naina. Thakur Dev kidnaps Dimpy, Chulbuli and Chutki. When the others got to know that the three were kidnapped, they started to haunt and taunt thakur so that he tells that where Chulbuli, Chutki and Dimpy are. When Thakur Dev was fed up and had enough, he tried to kill Krishna, Naina, Pavitra and Mai. But they didn't died. They returned in Thakur Dev's life to make him pay for his sins, but they didn't succeed in their plans. Thakur Dev now tried to create a rift between Naina and Pavitra, but Pavitra promised that she will make everything right, how it was before. Chulbuli, Dimpy and Chutki managed to escape from the goons den and went to the mansion. Meanwhile, Naina regains her memory. She accuses and abuses Pavitra for marrying Krishna. Now she wants to avenge Pavitra by taking her back to Mumbai, but Thakur didn't want to let go off Naina, because his revenge isn't complete yet. He want to have sex with Naina. He said that Naina and Pavitra only can leave this village if they unmarry back (Krishna with Pavitra and Naina with Thakur Dev). But the opposite happens. Pavitra goes in the room of Thakur Dev to save Naina, but then Krishna arrives in the room of Thakur Dev. After that Thakur Dev beats Krishna up, for stopping him. Meanwhile, the Mahant arrives with the villagers and The Thakurayan to expose Thakur Dev in front of the villagers. Thakurayan succeeds in her plans and the Thakur gets arrested. Now Naina is all set to go to Mumbai, but Pavitra is sad. Pavitra marries Krishna in full tradition. Krishna is now the Thakur of the village and Pavitra, the thakurayan. On their home way to Mumbai, Naina's car meets with an accident, because Purohitji told them that if Pavitra and Naina doesn't live together, they won't remain happy in life, because of their half-swastik tattoo on their arms. Naina regains consciousness, and they both go home.

Vishwaveer discovers that an abandoned baby girl is able to protect Gauri from a familial curse, and he adopts her, naming her Kaali and making her Gauri's \"kaala teeka\".\n\n'''After 5 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Sargam Khurana]]) continues protecting Gauri ([[Adaa Narang]]) in every way. Gauri, being Vishwaveer's only child, is brought up surrounded with comforts, while Vishwaveer doesn't treat Kaali very well. She is mistreated by Vishwaveer's sister-in-law Kalyani Jha ([[Mona Ambegaonkar]]). Vishwaveer's first wife, Manjiri Jha ([[Dalljiet Kaur]]), who doesn't have children, adores Kaali and brings her up as her own daughter.\n\nKalyani plots to kill Gauri to get revenge from Vishwaveer for an old matter. She kills Kaali first, so that she is unable to protect Gauri. However, Kaali survives, and relates the incident to Manjiri, who decides to make Kalyani pay.\n\nKaali and Manjiri confront Kalyani in a temple, where Kalyani ends up killing Manjiri by strangling her, and making it look like Kaali did it. When the family finds out, Vishwaveer decides to take the blame on himself and go to jail in Kaali's place, so that Kaali can stay with Gauri and continue to protect her. As a result, Vishwaveer goes to jail for 14 years.\n\n'''After 14 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Simran Pareenja]]) and Gauri ([[Fenil Umrigar]]) are grown up. Kaali is very intelligent and a good singer, but all credits are taken by Gauri. Kaali writes exams for her and sings for her. A guy named Yug Choudhary ([[Rohan Gandotra]]) hears Kaali's voice and is taken aback by her voice. He tries to search for her but is unable to find her. Everyone thinks that it is Gauri who sings and Yug also thinks the same, but he is not able to find Gauri. Vishwaveer, while searching for a suitable groom for Gauri, comes across Yug and resolves to get her married to him. Gauri initially refuses but Kaali convinces her, and Gauri eventually falls in love with Yug and agrees for marriage after testing him a couple of times. When Yug's grandmother rejects the proposal considering Vishwa to be a criminal, he brainwashes Gauri's brother Neelkanth \"Neel\" Jha ([[Nivin Ramani]]) into trying to rape Yug's sister Sharmila Choudhary ([[Meenu Panchal]]). Neel attempts to do so, but is held back by his conscience at the last minute. In order to save Sharmila's reputation, Yug's grandmother agrees to get Yug married to Gauri in exchange for Neel marrying Sharmila. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Manjiri is still alive and that she lost her memory 14 years ago and saved Yug's life, after which his father took her in as his sister. She is now living with Yug.\n\nAfter a while Kaali finds out that Manjiri is still alive and with the help of Yug, Kaali brings her memory back. Yug-Gauri and Neel-Sharmila are now scheduled to get married. Instead destiny wants to bring Yug and Kaali together who have fallen in love. Yug is actually Kaali's childhood Ramji.\n\nThe show goes on with Manjiri and Yug supporting Kali in each and every step to get back love of Vishwaveer and prove him superstitions are waste. Gauri's kundli's truth comes out and Kaali is forced to agree to be Gauri's Kaala Teeka again and goes to Yug's house. She gets anxious and encounters Vishwa and decides to leave. Manjiri and Kali get kidnapped by Kalyani, but Yug saves them. Kalyani is arrested and Manjiri goes back to Vishwa and demands Kali and Yug's alliance. Gauri drinks poison but she is saved and Vishwa realises that it was not Kali being kaala teeka that worked for Gauri but her prayers were the ones which truly worked. He fixes Yug and Kali's alliance to which Yug's mother Leelavita \"Leela\" Choudhary agrees only because of a hidden motto and she doesn't want Kali to be her daughter-in-law. Therefore, Leela and Gauri team up. Yug marries Kali but everyone get tricked as they assume it is Gauri who is marrying Yug. Yug doesn't trust Kali anymore and goes with Gauri. Yug starts to hate Kali.\n\nTime passes by and Yug finally finds out the truth behind Gauri and gets married to Kali once again. Gauri then plans to make Kali seem dead by injecting some type of medicine on her but that plan fails when her injection breaks. Instead, she puts the poison in the safety pin and hooks it on Kali's doli. Kali is pricked by the safety pin. While performing rituals and praying in the temple at Yug's house, Kali faints. They call the doctor but the doctor tells everyone that Kali is dead. Just then, Yug realizes that it could have been Gauri and goes to her hotel to drag her there. She fakes and does some drama of crying and says she will bring Kali back to life by burning kapur on her hand. She has already put chemical on her hand to make sure her palm doesn't burn. The poison wears off and Kali regains conscientious, leaving everyone believing Gauri. However Yug does not believe Gauri and sends her out of the house. Gauri vows for revenge. She comes back as a servant and starts to make Leela believe that an evil spirit is haunting her. She brings a fake astrologer and he tells that Yug should be 21 kilometers away from the house. Leela and Yug believe it and Yug leaves. Later with the help of the astrologer, Gauri makes it look like Kali has the evil spirit inside her and Leela decides to sacrifice Kali. Manjiri comes to Yug's house and discovers that there is a pooja going on and asks for Kali, who is locked in a room. Manjiri gets suspicious and follows the car leading to the ashram. She brings a real astrologer and the truth behind Gauri gets revealed to everyone. Kali, enraged, slaps Gauri for her deeds and Gauri later reveals to everyone that Leela did not want Kali to be her daughter in law and encouraged Gauri that Yug would be married to her. Yug gets distraught and leaves while Gauri and the fake astrologer get arrested. Gauri vows to destroy his whole family. After three months however, Gauri who is released from jail returns and reveals to everyone that she is pregnant with Yug's child. Because of this Yug allows her to stay until the child is born. Later, it is revealed that Kaali is also pregnant. This matter however, is only known by Gauri and Vishwa as they bribed the nurse to get her reports before she does. In order to make sure that Kaali and Yug stay apart Gauri plans to have Kali thrown out of the house which is eventually carried out by Yug himself, as he does so Vishwa then takes Kaali to the top of a cliff and reveals her pregnancy to her just as he is about to push her off. Vishwa pushes Kali off of the cliff but Kali hangs onto a branch. Vishwa throws rock at her and she falls. Afterwards, Kali's suicide note comes and everyone believes Kali to be dead. Leela asks Yug to marry Gauri and give the child a legitimate name. Yug agrees to marry Gauri. Meanwhile, Kali doesn't die and is saved by a mentally challenged man named Nandu Singh ([[Mayank Gandhi]]). Kali asks Nandu to take her to Choudhary House. Nandu takes her there but returns. There back in his village, some kids tease him as Kali's husband. Nandu becomes shy and later, Nandu marries Kali and then takes her to the hospital where he gets to know that Kali is in coma.\n\n'''7 months later'''\n\nYug is now turned as a puppet for Vishwaveer. Vishwaveer is the new landlord of Choudhary House. Nandu is seen taking care of Kali in the hospital. The nurses discuss that Kali has lost her child. Gauri and Yug travel to Veerpur. On there way Gauri gets labour pain and Yug takes her to the same hospital where Kali is admitted. Vishwaveer finds out that Kali is in the hospital. Meanwhile, Gauri delivers a baby girl and names it Naina. Naina gets kidnapped by Vishwa, after being told that baby is threat to his life and Kali finds out about Yug and Gauri and decides to commit suicide on the same river where Vishwa places Naina in a basket and floating away. Kali feels the basket and finds Naina in it and decides to live. She begins to raise Naina. Unknown to Kali is that Naina is Yug and Gauri's daughter, who are distraught after their baby went missing, and names it Naina. It is revealed that Vishwa attempted to kill Naina because of a superstition that says Naina is a threat to him. Manjiri later finds Kali at a temple and Kali reveals that she was once pregnant with Yug's child and Vishwa threw her off the cliff for the sake of Gauri. Manjiri vows revenge on Vishwa and brings Kali to Yug's house. Gauri does not like this and tries to kill her own daughter Naina. However it backfires. Meanwhile, Nandu finds out that Vishwa attempted to kill Kali and vows not to spare him. Fearing that the truth would come out, Vishwa gets rid of all the evidence he could find. He also find out that Kali's adopted daughter is actually Gauri and Yug's daughter Naina. Vishwa attempts to kill Kali and Naina but fails because of Nandu. Manjiri later finds out about this and scolds Vishwa and reveals her revenge against him. Kali and Naina disappeared once again and Manjiri threatens to kill Vishwa if he does not reveal where Kali and Naina are. It is later revealed that Kali had planned this to get the truth from Vishwa. Later, while Vishwa, along with his partner Raj Purohit ([[Rajesh Puri]]) conduct a Pooja, assuming that Kali is dead, Kali pretends to be a spirit to get Vishwa to say the truth. With the help of Nandu and Manjiri, Kali gets the truth out. Yug gets distraught by hearing this and a chandelier falls on Kali. While she is hospitalized Manjiri reveals the truth behind Vishwa and Gauri. Yug later gets Raj and Vishwa arrested but they escape. Naina gets kidnapped again but Kali and Manjiri finds her. Vishwa finds Kali and Manjiri and threatens to kill Kali and Naina. Before he could, Manjiri grabs a trishul and stabs Vishwa, killing him. After Vishwa's funeral, Yug asks Kali for forgiveness but Kali rejects saying that she is not a doll to play with. Nandu offers Kali to stay at his place but Yug threatens to kill Naina if Kali leaves. Kali stays but scolds Yug for being selfish and will only stay for Naina's sake. Leela declares Kali as Naina's official mother as Gauri is too dangerous for the number of sins she committed. At this time, a tantrik named Devri Singh ([[Vineet Raina]]) is introduced and reveals to be Nandu's brother. Kali and Manjiri get suspicious about Devri and ask a priest at an ashram and Raj Purohit, as he has no other option. Manjiri and Kali discover that Devri was Vishwa's Kaala Teeka. They also discovers Devri's true intentions to kill the baby Naina to gain evil powers. It is also revealed in Nandu's kundli that Nandu is Naina's Kaala Teeka. Discovering that Devri is a threat, Yug bans Devri from coming into the house while Devri plot to kill Naina is underway. Devri also decides to kill Kali because she is an obstacle that he has to overcome to kill Naina. But Manjiri and Nandu save them and Nandu and Kali get married for Naina's protection. This infuriates Yug and he decides to kill Nandu but is stopped by Gauri. Devri decides to kill his own brother Nandu in order to get Naina but Devri mistakenly stabs himself. Devri is rushed to the hospital. Yug later snatched Naina from Kali saying that she is no longer her mother. Yug meets with an accident and Naina and Yug are hospitalized. Devri donates blood to Naina but Kali would forgive him if he goes to jail. But Devri escaped and forms another plan to kill Naina. Jamuna soon finds out about this and warns Kali. Kali decides to kill Devri. Raj Purohit later finds out that only Kali and Nandu can kill Devri. Nandu does not want to kill his brother Devri. Kali decides to kill Devri with the help of Yug and she was successful. But Devri is still alive and attempted to drown Kali but is saved by Nandu who kills his own brother Devri.\n\n'''After 8 months'''\n\nKali is now pregnant with Nandu's child and Naina is shown to be 8 months old and causing trouble for Kali, Yug and Gauri. Naina runs to a forest and Kali finds her there. while she was there, she gives birth to Nandu's child and names her Pavitra. A nearby tantrik reveals that Pavitra would not be able to live for no longer than seven years.\n\n'''5 years later'''\n\nNandu had died when he killed Devri. Yug decides to adopt Pavitra. Gauri gets jealous to Kaali because she think that Kaali was take her life. Gauri becomes angry after knowing that Kaali and Yug get closer again. She then burned the house. Everybody is dead but Kaali is trapped in her room. Naina and Pavitra was saved and they ran away from the house. Gauri chases them and wants to kill Pavitra. But fuel tank of her car was leaked and her car was exploded, Gauri dead. In the next day, Chulbuli comes home and is shocked to see the house was burned. Naina and Pavitra go back home and meet Chulbuli. They feel sad when everybody found dead. But Kaali still trapped in her room. They search Kaali and the found her, they take Kaali to hospital. Suddenly, Kaali wake up and hug Naina and Pavitra. Raj Purohit come to hospital and ask forgiveness to Kaali. Raj Purohit confess that myth about kaala teeka of Gauri is just a hoax. He made up the story about kaala teeka because he was treated by Vishwaveer. Kaali forgives him and make him promise to not tell about superstition anymore. Kaali want Chulbuli to take care of her daughter. Kaali closed her eyes and dies. A few days later, Jamuna come home and wants to take Pavitra to stay with her. Naina, Chulbuli and Pavitra herself didn't let her to take Pavitra. Chulbuli says to Raj Purohit to bring Naina and Pavitra to Neel and Sharmila in the city to avoid Jamuna. But before that happen, Jamuna comes and takes Pavitra away. Moving to Bhimpur, the bus in which they were traveling meets with an accident and Jamuna dies. Pavitra faints, falls into the river, and she floats away to another village. Maai finds her and says that she will take care of her.\n\n'''14 years later'''\n\nNaina ([[Sukirti Kandpal]]), Gauri and Yug's daughter, lives in [[Mumbai]] while Pavitra (also [[Simran Pareenja]]), Kaali and Nandu's daughter, lives in Bhimpur village. Pavitra just looks like her mother Kaali. Naina goes to college and on every holiday she goes to several villages in search of Pavitra. This time she went to Bhimpur. In Bhimpur, she stays at a girl's house called Barki, which she helped during a bus accident. Naina doesn't know that the girl in whose house she is staying is Pavitra's house. In Bhimpur, there is a ride called \"Ganga Darpan\" in which innocent girls are decked up as brides and are send to the other village, in order to do prostitution. But the villagers are not aware of this. They think that the girls are being send to an Ashram for being Sanyasi's all their lives. This all is a big sex scandal. In all of this, Thakur Dev Sinha ([[Parag Tyagi]]), the Thakur of the village and the Mahant was involved. However, Naina tried to exposed Thakur Dev and the Mahant in front of the villagers, but nobody listened to her and she was sent back to Mumbai. But Naina didn't gave up and went back to Bhimpur, this time with Chulbuli and Dimpy. There Naina meet Krishna Sinha ([[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]]), the son of Thakur Dev Sinha. There was a glimpse of love at first sight. With the help of Krishna and Barki, Naina created a plan to expose the Thakur. The 45th time Barki was chosen for the \"Ganga Darpan\" and Naina wanted to stop this and she succeeds, but Thakur Dev Sinha accused Mahant and he was sent to jail instead of both of them. Then all the girls returned to their parents. However, Thakur Dev tried to kill Naina and Krishna, but couldn't succeed. One day Mai (also Barki's mother) wanted to remove all the proof of Pavitra's existence, but could't do it because Barki got to know that she is Pavitra. Naina saves Barki and they got back to the village. Thakur Dev didn't stop his cunning and slimy tricks. He harms Naina and marries her, cheating Krishna who was about to marry Naina, in order to rape Naina, because she exposed him. Naina losts her memory. Pavitra marries Krishna to enter Thakur Dev's mansion in order to save Naina. Thakur Dev kidnaps Dimpy, Chulbuli and Chutki. When the others got to know that the three were kidnapped, they started to haunt and taunt thakur so that he tells that where Chulbuli, Chutki and Dimpy are. When Thakur Dev was fed up and had enough, he tried to kill Krishna, Naina, Pavitra and Mai. But they didn't died. They returned in Thakur Dev's life to make him pay for his sins, but they didn't succeed in their plans. Thakur Dev now tried to create a rift between Naina and Pavitra, but Pavitra promised that she will make everything right, how it was before. Chulbuli, Dimpy and Chutki managed to escape from the goons den and went to the mansion. Meanwhile, Naina regains her memory. She accuses and abuses Pavitra for marrying Krishna. Now she wants to avenge Pavitra by taking her back to Mumbai, but Thakur didn't want to let go off Naina, because his revenge isn't complete yet. He want to have sex with Naina. He said that Naina and Pavitra only can leave this village if they unmarry back (Krishna with Pavitra and Naina with Thakur Dev). But the opposite happens. Pavitra goes in the room of Thakur Dev to save Naina, but then Krishna arrives in the room of Thakur Dev. After that Thakur Dev beats Krishna up, for stopping him. Meanwhile, the Mahant arrives with the villagers and The Thakurayan to expose Thakur Dev in front of the villagers. Thakurayan succeeds in her plans and the Thakur gets arrested. Now Naina is all set to go to Mumbai, but Pavitra is sad. Pavitra gets married to Krishna in full tradition. Krishna is now the Thakur of the village and Pavitra, the thakurayan. On their home way to Mumbai, Naina's car meets with an accident, because Purohitji told them that if Pavitra and Naina doesn't live together, they won't remain happy in life, because of their half-swastik tattoo on their arms.

He represented Northern Ireland in international events, as his parents are from [[Belfast]].\n\nHe has enjoyed moderate success in his career, reaching his highest ranking, 26th, for the [[Snooker season 2004/2005|2004/2005 season]], and has reached one ranking final, at the [[Players Tour Championship 2013/2014 \u2013 Finals|2014 Players Championship Grand Final]], where he lost 4\u20130 to [[Barry Hawkins]]. Alongside this, Greene reached a ranking semi-final, at the [[2007 Grand Prix (snooker)|2007 Grand Prix]], losing to the eventual champion [[Marco Fu]], and five quarter-finals.\n\nRepresenting Northern Ireland with teammate [[Mark Allen (snooker player)|Mark Allen]], he reached the final of the [[2011 World Cup (snooker)|2011 World Cup]], where they lost to China.\n\nGreene has qualified for the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] five times without winning a match at the [[Crucible Theatre]], although he twice drew the defending champion \u2013 [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] in 1999, and [[Peter Ebdon]] in 2003. He was [[Snooker world rankings|ranked]] within the world's top 64 players from 1997 until he fell off the [[World Snooker Tour|main tour]], losing his professional status, in 2016.<ref>http://cuetracker.net/Players/Gerard-Greene/Career-Total-Statistics</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nGreene turned pro and joined the professional ranks in 1993/94 at the age of 20.  In 1995/96 he got to the latter stages of three events and was up 38 places to 72nd in the World Rankings. In 1997 he got to his first ranking Quarter-final in the [[UK Championship]] by beating Ian Burmby 6\u20135 in the first round, Steve Davis 6\u20132 in the second round, [[Andy Hicks]] 9\u20136 in the third round, and [[Gary Ponting]] 9\u20136 in the last 16, taking him to the Quarter-finals where he lost 6\u20139 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].\n\n=== 2003/2004 ===\nHe started the 2003/04 season in superb form reaching the British Open quarter final and the last 32 of the [[UK Championship]] beating [[Joe Swail]] 9\u20134 in the first round, then losing 9\u20137 to [[Matthew Stevens]]. He also reached the last 32 of the LG Cup.  He was briefly provisionally in the top 16 but then suffered a mid season slump.  Things picked up a little later in the campaign and he was assured of a place in the top 32 for the first time at number 26, and overtook Swail to become the number one player from Northern Ireland.\n\n=== 2004/2005 ===\nHe then had some problems with his cue and his form suffered during the 2004/5 season when he failed in all but two of the ranking events, and despite reaching the Irish Masters quarter final he found himself back down to 38th in the rankings.\n\n=== 2006/2007 ===\nHe returned to the top 32 after 2006/2007, the highlight being a run to the last 16 of the Northern Ireland Trophy.\n\n=== 2007/2008 ===\nHe reached his first ranking semi-final at the 2007 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]].  Greene came through Group B which included [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]], [[Steve Davis]], [[Dominic Dale]] and qualifiers [[Tom Ford (snooker player)|Tom Ford]] and [[Mark Joyce]].  He beat Davis and Dale 4\u20130, Ford 4\u20133 and Joyce 4\u20132, his only defeat coming at the hands of Ronnie O'Sullivan, 4\u20132. He defeated qualifier [[Ricky Walden]] 5\u20130 in the last 16 with breaks of 101 and 91. In his quarter-final he faced [[Joe Perry (snooker player)|Joe Perry]], who he defeated 5\u20133 with breaks of 68, 57, 123 and rounding of the match with a 53. Eventual champion [[Marco Fu]] edged him out 6\u20135 in the semi-final. For a while before this tournament, he had no snooker club to practice in.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/7051299.stm BBC SPORT | Other Sport... | Snooker | Higgins angry after defeat by Fu<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShowing his best form for years, he also reached the Quarter-final of the 2007 [[Northern Ireland Trophy]], beating [[Liang Wenbo]] (5\u20132) in the first round. Then he beat former World Champions [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] (5\u20133) and [[Ken Doherty]] (5\u20131) on the way. His run ended in the hands of [[Mark Allen (snooker player)|Mark Allen]], who he lost to 5\u20133. He lost form in 2008 however, failing to qualify for the World Championship after a 2\u201310 defeat to journeyman [[Mark Davis (snooker player)|Mark Davis]].\n\n=== 2008/2009 ===\nGreene's 2008/2009 season was solid but unspectacular. He won his opening match in six of the season's eight tournaments, but only went further in two of them. Crucially, he qualified for the World Championship by defeating [[Liu Song (snooker player)|Liu Song]] and [[Ken Doherty]] (gaining revenge for a defeat Doherty inflicted on him in the [[Northern Ireland Trophy]]). He was beaten 10\u20135 by [[Ali Carter]] in the first round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snooker.org/res/index.asp?event=61 |title=Betfred.com World Championship |publisher=Snooker.org |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009/2010 ===\nGreene qualified for five of the six ranking events during the [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/2010 season]], but once there lost in the wildcard round of the [[2009 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] to [[Li Yan (snooker player)|Li Yan]] and in the first round of the other four.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?season=2009&player=38 |title=Gerard Greene 2009/2010 |publisher=Snooker.org |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> He finished the year ranked world number 28.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ardalen |first=Hermund |title=Provisional World Rankings 2010/2011 |publisher=Snooker.org |year=2010 |url=http://www.snooker.org/rnk/0910/prov.asp |accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010/2011 ===\nGreene began the [[Snooker season 2010/2011|2010/2011 season]] brightly by reaching the semi-finals of the second [[Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Event 2|Players Tour Championship]] event.

He represented Northern Ireland in international events, as his parents are from [[Belfast]].\n\nHe has enjoyed moderate success in his career, reaching his highest ranking, 26th, for the [[Snooker season 2004/2005|2004/2005 season]], and has reached one ranking final, at the [[Players Tour Championship 2013/2014 \u2013 Finals|2014 Players Championship Grand Final]], where he lost 4\u20130 to [[Barry Hawkins]]. Alongside this, Greene reached a ranking semi-final, at the [[2007 Grand Prix (snooker)|2007 Grand Prix]], losing to the eventual champion [[Marco Fu]], and five quarter-finals.\n\nRepresenting Northern Ireland with teammate [[Mark Allen (snooker player)|Mark Allen]], he reached the final of the [[2011 World Cup (snooker)|2011 World Cup]], where they lost to China.\n\nGreene has qualified for the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] five times without winning a match at the [[Crucible Theatre]], although he twice drew the defending champion \u2013 [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] in 1999, and [[Peter Ebdon]] in 2003. He was [[Snooker world rankings|ranked]] within the world's top 64 players from 1997 until he fell off the [[World Snooker Tour|main tour]], losing his professional status, in 2016.<ref>http://cuetracker.net/Players/Gerard-Greene/Career-Total-Statistics</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nGreene turned pro and joined the professional ranks in 1993/94 at the age of 20.  In 1995/96 he got to the latter stages of three events and was up 38 places to 72nd in the World Rankings. In 1997 he got to his first ranking Quarter-final in the [[UK Championship]] by beating Ian Burmby 6\u20135 in the first round, Steve Davis 6\u20132 in the second round, [[Andy Hicks]] 9\u20136 in the third round, and [[Gary Ponting]] 9\u20136 in the last 16, taking him to the Quarter-finals where he lost 6\u20139 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].\n\n=== 2003/2004 ===\nHe started the 2003/04 season in superb form reaching the British Open quarter final and the last 32 of the [[UK Championship]] beating [[Joe Swail]] 9\u20134 in the first round, then losing 9\u20137 to [[Matthew Stevens]]. He also reached the last 32 of the LG Cup.  He was briefly provisionally in the top 16 but then suffered a mid season slump.  Things picked up a little later in the campaign and he was assured of a place in the top 32 for the first time at number 26, and overtook Swail to become the number one player from Northern Ireland.\n\n=== 2004/2005 ===\nHe then had some problems with his cue and his form suffered during the 2004/5 season when he failed in all but two of the ranking events, and despite reaching the Irish Masters quarter final he found himself back down to 38th in the rankings.\n\n=== 2006/2007 ===\nHe returned to the top 32 after 2006/2007, the highlight being a run to the last 16 of the Northern Ireland Trophy.\n\n=== 2007/2008 ===\nHe reached his first ranking semi-final at the 2007 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]].  Greene came through Group B which included [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]], [[Steve Davis]], [[Dominic Dale]] and qualifiers [[Tom Ford (snooker player)|Tom Ford]] and [[Mark Joyce]].  He beat Davis and Dale 4\u20130, Ford 4\u20133 and Joyce 4\u20132, his only defeat coming at the hands of Ronnie O'Sullivan, 4\u20132. He defeated qualifier [[Ricky Walden]] 5\u20130 in the last 16 with breaks of 101 and 91. In his quarter-final he faced [[Joe Perry (snooker player)|Joe Perry]], who he defeated 5\u20133 with breaks of 68, 57, 123 and rounding of the match with a 53. Eventual champion [[Marco Fu]] edged him out 6\u20135 in the semi-final. For a while before this tournament, he had no snooker club to practice in.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/7051299.stm BBC SPORT | Other Sport... | Snooker | Higgins angry after defeat by Fu<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShowing his best form for years, he also reached the Quarter-final of the 2007 [[Northern Ireland Trophy]], beating [[Liang Wenbo]] (5\u20132) in the first round. Then he beat former World Champions [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] (5\u20133) and [[Ken Doherty]] (5\u20131) on the way. His run ended in the hands of [[Mark Allen (snooker player)|Mark Allen]], who he lost to 5\u20133. He lost form in 2008 however, failing to qualify for the World Championship after a 2\u201310 defeat to journeyman [[Mark Davis (snooker player)|Mark Davis]].\n\n=== 2008/2009 ===\nGreene's 2008/2009 season was solid but unspectacular. He won his opening match in six of the season's eight tournaments, but only went further in two of them. Crucially, he qualified for the World Championship by defeating [[Liu Song (snooker player)|Liu Song]] and [[Ken Doherty]] (gaining revenge for a defeat Doherty inflicted on him in the [[Northern Ireland Trophy]]). He was beaten 10\u20135 by [[Ali Carter]] in the first round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snooker.org/res/index.asp?event=61 |title=Betfred.com World Championship |publisher=Snooker.org |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009/2010 ===\nGreene qualified for five of the six ranking events during the [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/2010 season]], but once there lost in the wildcard round of the [[2009 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]] to [[Li Yan (snooker player)|Li Yan]] and in the first round of the other four.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?season=2009&player=38 |title=Gerard Greene 2009/2010 |publisher=Snooker.org |accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> He finished the year ranked world number 28.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ardalen |first=Hermund |title=Provisional World Rankings 2010/2011 |publisher=Snooker.org |year=2010 |url=http://www.snooker.org/rnk/0910/prov.asp |accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010/2011 ===\nGreene began the [[Snooker season 2010/2011|2010/2011 season]] brightly by reaching the semi-finals of the second [[Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Event 2|Players Tour Championship]] event.
