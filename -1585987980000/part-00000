March 19, 2020, the Russian Government reported the following data. More than 55 thousand infectious beds were deployed, including more than 12 thousand intensive care units and 396 observatories. 7.5 thousand Melzer boxes were prepared. Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices. Today, 6 thousand infectious diseases doctors and almost 2 thousand pulmonologists, more than 18 thousand nurses are ready to provide medical assistance.<ref>http://government.ru/news/39218/</ref>\n\nThe independent journalistic website [[proekt.media]] reports that as soon as the number of cases of coronavirus in Russia reaches 800 thousand people, and the number of hospitalized \u2014 160 thousand, ventilation devices in hospitals will run out.<br/>According to the [[OECD]], Russia ranks third in the number of beds per capita. However, in the case of Russia, beds are literally only beds. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger.\n<ref>https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/</ref>\n\nData collected by the news website [[Meduza]] indicates that Russia's supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries. That said, ventilators alone are not enough to overcome the pandemic. Without a specialist nearby, rental ventilators will be useless. In a number of other areas, comparing Russian and Italian health infrastructure doesn't bode well at all for Russia.<br/>Aside from the question of whether the ventilators available actually fit patients\u2019 needs, there's the fact that if a patient has to be on a ventilator, they're already in critical condition. That means they need a whole set of critical care procedures, specialized equipment, and medical professionals who can use that equipment and put those measures in place. This is where Russian medicine loses out to Italy. For example, when Italy says they don't have enough nurses, for them, that means there used to be one nurse per patient, and now, there's one for every two. Well, we\u2019ve got one nurse serving three or four or five already.<ref>https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem</ref>\n{{Collapse top}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKhanty-Mansi AO\n| data1    = \n56.8\n\n| label2   = \nSamara region\n| data2    = \n42.6\n\n| label3   = \nAmur region\n| data3    = \n42.5\n\n| label4   = \nMoscow (city)\n| data4    = \n40\n\n| label5   = \nKirov region\n| data5    = \n39.6\n\n| label6   = \nArkhangelsk region\n| data6    = \n38.4\n\n| label7   = \nSakha Republic (Yakutia)\n| data7    = \n37.2\n\n| label8   = \nSakhalin region\n| data8    = \n37.1\n\n| label9   = \nTomsk region\n| data9    = \n37.1\n\n| label10   = \nSt. Petersburg (city)\n| data10    = \n35.2\n\n| label11   = \nLipetsk region\n| data11    = \n35.1\n\n| label12   = \nSverdlovsk region\n| data12    = \n35\n\n| label13   = \nChuvash Republic (Chuvashia)\n| data13    = \n34.7\n\n| label14   = \nAltai Krai\n| data14    = \n34.6\n\n| label15   = \nRepublic of Crimea (status disputed)\n| data15    = \n34.3\n\n| label16   = \nRepublic of Karelia\n| data16    = \n32.5\n\n| label17   = \nYaroslavl region\n| data17    = \n31.5\n\n| label18   = \nVladimir region\n| data18    = \n31.4\n\n| label19   = \nTambov region\n| data19    = \n31.2\n| label20   = \nPenza region\n| data20    = \n30.7\n\n| label21   = \nMurmansk region\n| data21    = \n30.5\n\n| label22   = \nPskov region\n| data22    = \n30.3\n\n| label23   = \nRepublic of Tatarstan\n| data23    = \n28.2\n| label24   = \nOrenburg region\n| data24    = \n27.7\n\n| label25   = \n'''Russia'''\n| data25    = \n27.3\n\n| label26   = \nKemerovo region\n| data26    = \n27.3\n\n| label27   = \nRyazan region\n| data27    = \n27.1\n\n| label28   = \nIrkutsk region\n| data28    = \n26.5\n\n| label29   = \nRepublic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria)\n| data29    = \n25.5\n\n| label30   = \nRepublic of Buryatia\n| data30    = \n24.9\n\n}}\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKrasnoyarsk Krai\n| data1    = \n24.6\n\n| label2   = \nChelyabinsk region\n| data2    = \n24.5\n\n| label3   = \nAstrakhan region\n| data3    = \n23.9\n\n| label4   = \nZabaikalsky Krai\n| data4    = \n22.8\n\n| label5   = \nSaratov region\n| data5    = \n22.1\n\n| label6   = \nVologda region\n| data6    = \n22.1\n\n| label7   = \nKursk region\n| data7    = \n21.9\n\n| label8   = \nOrel region\n| data8    = \n21.8\n\n| label9   = \nMari El Republic\n| data9    = \n20.9\n\n| label10   = \nNovosibirsk region\n| data10    = \n20.4\n\n| label11   = \nTula region\n| data11    = \n20.3\n\n| label12   = \nUdmurt Republic (Udmurtia)\n| data12    = \n20.2\n\n| label13   = \nPerm Krai\n| data13    = \n20\n\n| label14   = \nKostroma region\n| data14    = \n19.1\n\n| label15   = \n'''United States'''\n| data15    = \n18.8\n\n| label16   = \nKaliningrad region\n| data16    = \n18.8\n\n| label17   = \nOmsk region\n| data17    = \n18.7\n\n| label18   = \nIvanovo region\n| data18    = \n17.9\n\n| label19   = \nKrasnodar Krai\n| data19    = \n17.6\n\n| label20   = \nBelgorod region\n| data20    = \n16.8\n\n| label21   = \nRostov region\n| data21    = \n15.3\n\n| label22   = \nVoronezh region\n| data22    = \n15\n\n| label23   = \nLeningrad region\n| data23    = \n14.3\n\n| label24   = \n'''United Kingdom'''\n| data24    = \n12.9\n\n| label25   = \nSevastopol (city;

March 19, 2020, the Russian Government reported the following data. More than 55 thousand infectious beds were deployed, including more than 12 thousand intensive care units and 396 observatories. 7.5 thousand Melzer boxes were prepared. Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices. Today, 6 thousand infectious diseases doctors and almost 2 thousand pulmonologists, more than 18 thousand nurses are ready to provide medical assistance.<ref>http://government.ru/news/39218/</ref>\n\nThe independent journalistic website [[proekt.media]] reports that as soon as the number of cases of coronavirus in Russia reaches 800 thousand people, and the number of hospitalized \u2014 160 thousand, ventilation devices in hospitals will run out.<br/>According to the [[OECD]], Russia ranks third in the number of beds per capita. However, in the case of Russia, beds are literally only beds. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger.\n<ref>https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/</ref>\n\nData collected by the news website [[Meduza]] indicates that Russia\u2019s supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries. That said, ventilators alone are not enough to overcome the pandemic. Without a specialist nearby, rental ventilators will be useless. In a number of other areas, comparing Russian and Italian health infrastructure doesn\u2019t bode well at all for Russia.<br/>Aside from the question of whether the ventilators available actually fit patients\u2019 needs, there\u2019s the fact that if a patient has to be on a ventilator, they\u2019re already in critical condition. That means they need a whole set of critical care procedures, specialized equipment, and medical professionals who can use that equipment and put those measures in place. This is where Russian medicine loses out to Italy. For example, when Italy says they don\u2019t have enough nurses, for them, that means there used to be one nurse per patient, and now, there\u2019s one for every two. Well, we\u2019ve got one nurse serving three or four or five already.<ref>https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem</ref>\n{{Collapse top}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKhanty-Mansi AO\n| data1    = \n56.8\n\n| label2   = \nSamara region\n| data2    = \n42.6\n\n| label3   = \nAmur region\n| data3    = \n42.5\n\n| label4   = \nMoscow (city)\n| data4    = \n40\n\n| label5   = \nKirov region\n| data5    = \n39.6\n\n| label6   = \nArkhangelsk region\n| data6    = \n38.4\n\n| label7   = \nSakha Republic (Yakutia)\n| data7    = \n37.2\n\n| label8   = \nSakhalin region\n| data8    = \n37.1\n\n| label9   = \nTomsk region\n| data9    = \n37.1\n\n| label10   = \nSt. Petersburg (city)\n| data10    = \n35.2\n\n| label11   = \nLipetsk region\n| data11    = \n35.1\n\n| label12   = \nSverdlovsk region\n| data12    = \n35\n\n| label13   = \nChuvash Republic (Chuvashia)\n| data13    = \n34.7\n\n| label14   = \nAltai Krai\n| data14    = \n34.6\n\n| label15   = \nRepublic of Crimea (status disputed)\n| data15    = \n34.3\n\n| label16   = \nRepublic of Karelia\n| data16    = \n32.5\n\n| label17   = \nYaroslavl region\n| data17    = \n31.5\n\n| label18   = \nVladimir region\n| data18    = \n31.4\n\n| label19   = \nTambov region\n| data19    = \n31.2\n| label20   = \nPenza region\n| data20    = \n30.7\n\n| label21   = \nMurmansk region\n| data21    = \n30.5\n\n| label22   = \nPskov region\n| data22    = \n30.3\n\n| label23   = \nRepublic of Tatarstan\n| data23    = \n28.2\n| label24   = \nOrenburg region\n| data24    = \n27.7\n\n| label25   = \n'''Russia'''\n| data25    = \n27.3\n\n| label26   = \nKemerovo region\n| data26    = \n27.3\n\n| label27   = \nRyazan region\n| data27    = \n27.1\n\n| label28   = \nIrkutsk region\n| data28    = \n26.5\n\n| label29   = \nRepublic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria)\n| data29    = \n25.5\n\n| label30   = \nRepublic of Buryatia\n| data30    = \n24.9\n\n}}\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKrasnoyarsk Krai\n| data1    = \n24.6\n\n| label2   = \nChelyabinsk region\n| data2    = \n24.5\n\n| label3   = \nAstrakhan region\n| data3    = \n23.9\n\n| label4   = \nZabaikalsky Krai\n| data4    = \n22.8\n\n| label5   = \nSaratov region\n| data5    = \n22.1\n\n| label6   = \nVologda region\n| data6    = \n22.1\n\n| label7   = \nKursk region\n| data7    = \n21.9\n\n| label8   = \nOrel region\n| data8    = \n21.8\n\n| label9   = \nMari El Republic\n| data9    = \n20.9\n\n| label10   = \nNovosibirsk region\n| data10    = \n20.4\n\n| label11   = \nTula region\n| data11    = \n20.3\n\n| label12   = \nUdmurt Republic (Udmurtia)\n| data12    = \n20.2\n\n| label13   = \nPerm Krai\n| data13    = \n20\n\n| label14   = \nKostroma region\n| data14    = \n19.1\n\n| label15   = \n'''United States'''\n| data15    = \n18.8\n\n| label16   = \nKaliningrad region\n| data16    = \n18.8\n\n| label17   = \nOmsk region\n| data17    = \n18.7\n\n| label18   = \nIvanovo region\n| data18    = \n17.9\n\n| label19   = \nKrasnodar Krai\n| data19    = \n17.6\n\n| label20   = \nBelgorod region\n| data20    = \n16.8\n\n| label21   = \nRostov region\n| data21    = \n15.3\n\n| label22   = \nVoronezh region\n| data22    = \n15\n\n| label23   = \nLeningrad region\n| data23    = \n14.3\n\n| label24   = \n'''United Kingdom'''\n| data24    = \n12.9\n\n| label25   = \nSevastopol (city;

Launched on April 24, 2012, Google Drive allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and [[file sharing|share files]]. In addition to a [[web application|website]], Google Drive offers apps with offline capabilities for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] computers, and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] smartphones and tablets. Google Drive encompasses [[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], and [[Google Slides]], which are a part of an [[office suite]] that permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more. Files created and edited through the office suite are saved in Google Drive.\n\nGoogle Drive offers users 15&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s of free storage through [[Google One]]. Google One also offers 100&nbsp;gigabytes, 200&nbsp;gigabytes, 2&nbsp;[[terabyte]]s, 10&nbsp;terabytes, 20&nbsp;terabytes, and 30&nbsp;terabytes offered through optional paid plans. Files uploaded can be up to 5&nbsp;terabytes in size. Users can change privacy settings for individual files and folders, including enabling sharing with other users or making content public. On the website, users can search for an image by describing its visuals, and use [[natural language processing|natural language]] to find specific files, such as \"find my budget spreadsheet from last December\".\n\nThe website and Android app offer a Backups section to see what Android devices have data backed up to the service, and a completely overhauled computer app released in July 2017 allows for backing up specific folders on the user's computer. A Quick Access feature can [[Machine learning|intelligently predict]] the files users need.\n\nGoogle Drive is a key component of [[G Suite]], Google's monthly subscription offering for businesses and organizations. As part of select G Suite plans, Drive offers unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting, enhanced administration controls, and greater collaboration tools for teams.\n\nFollowing the launch of the service, Google Drive's privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media. Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create [[derivative work]]s from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the right to use the information and data to customize the advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services, but that the competition uses \"more artful language\" in the agreements, and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to \"move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails\".\n\n{{As of|2017|3}}, Google Drive has 800&nbsp;million active users, and as of September 2015, it has over one million organizational paying users. {{As of|2017|5}}, there are over two trillion files stored on the service.\n\n== Platforms ==\n{{infobox software\n| name = Google Drive\n| logo = Google Drive logo.svg\n| screenshot = [[File:Screenshot of Google Drive app for Android.png|237px]]\n| operating system = [[Chrome OS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]]\n| programming language = [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (back-end), [[Objective-C]] (Mac client), [[wxPython]] (Windows client)<ref>{{cite web |title=Open source components and licenses |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/1716931 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref>\n| ver layout = stacked\n| latest release version <!-- List platforms that are still being officially developed by Google --> = {{Multiple releases\n|branch1 = Android\n|version1 = 2.20.061.04\n|date1 = {{Start date and age|2020|02|13}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/drive/|title=Google Drive APKs|website=APKMirror|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n|branch2 = iOS\n|version2 = 4.2019.42202\n|date2 = {{Start date and age|2019|10|22}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.apple.com/app/id507874739|title=Google Drive|website=App Store|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> }}\n| license = [[Freeware]]\n| website = {{url|https://www.google.com/drive/}}\n| caption = Google Drive's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app\n}}\n\nGoogle Drive was introduced on April 24, 2012 with apps available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], as well as a [[web application|website interface]].<ref name=\"Introducing Google Drive\">{{cite web |first=Sundar |last=Pichai |title=Introducing Google Drive... yes, really |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2012/04/introducing-google-drive-yes-really.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> The iOS app was released later in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sean |last=Gallagher |title=Hands-on with the Google Drive for iOS app: mostly read only |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/06/hands-on-with-the-google-drive-for-ios-app-mostly-read-only/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=June 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Computer apps ===\n\nGoogle Drive is available for PCs running [[Windows 7]] or later, and Macs running [[Mac OS X Lion|OS X Lion]] or later.<ref>{{cite web |title=System requirements and browsers |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375082 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}</ref> Google indicated in April 2012 that work on Linux software was underway,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/254488/google_drive_for_linux_is_on_the_way.html|title=Google Drive for Linux Is on the Way|last=Noyes|first=Katherine|date=April 25, 2012|website=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> but there was no news on this as of November 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-drive-for-linux-patience-patience/ |title=Google Drive for Linux?

However, if the account lapsed for any reason, users had to choose from current plans.\n\n== Features ==\n=== Sharing ===\nGoogle Drive incorporates a system of file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder is, by default, its owner. The owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder. Ownership is transferable. Files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a [[Google account]], using their ''@gmail.com'' email addresses. Sharing files with users not having a Google account requires making them accessible to \"anybody with the link\". This generates a secret URL for the file, which may be shared via email or private messages. Files and folders can also be made \"public on the web\", which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone. The owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions. The three access levels offered are \"can edit\", \"can comment\" and \"can view\". Users with editing access can invite others to edit.\n\n=== Third-party apps ===\nA number of external [[web application]]s that work with Google Drive are available from the [[Chrome Web Store]]. To add an app, users are required to sign into the Chrome Web Store, but the apps are compatible with all supported web browsers. Some of these apps are first-party, such as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Drive apps operate on the online files and can be used to view, edit and create files in various formats, edit images and videos, fax and sign documents, manage projects, create flowcharts, etc. Drive apps can also be made the default for handling file formats supported by them. Some of these apps also work offline on [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chrome OS]].<ref name=\"about third-party apps\">{{cite web |title=Use Google Drive apps |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2500820 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Chitu |title=Chrome and Google Drive's Third-Party Apps |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.no/2012/04/chrome-and-google-drives-third-party.html |date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAll of the third-party apps are free to install.

It allows users to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations online while collaborating in real-time with other users. The three apps are available as [[web application]]s, as [[Chrome app]]s that work offline, and as [[mobile app]]s for Android and iOS. The apps are compatible with [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. The suite also consists of [[Google Forms]], [[Google Drawings]] and [[Google Fusion Tables]] (retired in December 2019). While Forms and Tables are only available as web applications, Drawings is also available as a Chrome app. The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive, and all files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive.\n\n===Updates===\n\nUpdates to Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms have introduced features using [[machine learning]], including \"Explore\", offering search results based on the contents of a document, answers based on [[Natural language processing|natural language]] questions in a spreadsheet, and dynamic design suggestions based on contents of a slideshow, and \"Action items\", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.\nWhile Google Docs has been criticized for lacking the functionality of [[Microsoft Office]], it has received praise for its simplicity, ease of collaboration and frequent product updates.\n\nIn order to view and edit Docs, Sheets, or Slides documents offline, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A [[Google Chrome#Extensions|Chrome extension]], ''Google Docs Offline'', allows users to enable offline support for Docs, Sheets and Slides files on the Google Drive website.<ref>{{cite web |title=Work on Google files offline |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=January 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nGoogle also offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called ''Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides'' that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Office documents on Google Chrome, via Docs, Sheets and Slides apps.

Google Drawings can be used for creating charts, diagrams, designs, flow-charts, etc. It contains a subset of the features in Google Slides but with different templates. Its features include laying out drawings precisely with alignment guides, snap to grid, auto distribution, and inserting drawings into other Google documents, spreadsheets, or presentations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Create & edit drawings |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179740 |website=Docs editors Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Features ===\nIn a review of Google Drive after its launch in April 2012, Dan Grabham of ''[[TechRadar]]'' wrote that the integration of Google Docs into Google Drive was \"a bit confusing\", mainly due to the differences in the [[user interface]]s between the two, where Drive offers a \"My Drive\" section with a specific \"Shared with me\" view for shared documents. He stated that \"We think the user interface needs a lot more work. It's like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here\". He considered uploading files \"fairly easy\", but noted that folder upload was only supported through the [[Google Chrome]] web browser. The lack of native editing of [[Microsoft Office]] documents was \"annoying\". Regarding Google Drive's computer apps, he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was \"powerful\". He wrote that Drive was \"a great addition to Google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly\", while again criticizing the interface for being \"confusing\" and that the file view was \"not quite intuitive enough\" without file icons. Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app, writing that \"it's a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish\", and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being \"easy\". He also praised that \"everything is easily searchable\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Grabham |title=Hands on: Google Drive review |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/web/hands-on-google-drive-review-1077614 |website=[[TechRadar]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA review by Michael Muchmore of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' in February 2016 praised the service as \"truly impressive\" in creating and editing files, describing its features as \"leading\" in office-suite collaboration. He added that \"Compatibility is rarely an issue\", with importing and exporting options, and that the free storage of 15&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s was \"generous\". However, he also criticized the user interface for being confusing to navigate, and wrote that \"Offline editing isn't simple\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Muchmore |title=Google Drive |url=http://uk.pcmag.com/google-drive/15854/review/google-drive |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Android version of Google Drive has been criticized for requiring users to individually toggle each file for use offline instead of allowing entire folders to be stored offline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.labnol.org/software/android-file-shortcuts-google-drive/31351/|title=How to Place Files Shortcuts on Android Home Screen with Google Drive|website=www.labnol.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Ownership and licensing ===\nImmediately after its announcement in April 2012, Google faced criticism over Google Drive privacy. In particular, privacy advocates have noted that Google has one unified set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements for all its products and services. In a ''[[CNET]]'' report, Zack Whittaker noted that \"the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users' copyright and intellectual property rights\". In a comparison of Terms of Service agreements between Google Drive and competing cloud storage services [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[OneDrive]], he cited a paragraph stating that Google has broad rights to reproduce, use, and create [[derivative work]]s from content stored on Google Drive, via a license from its users. Although the user retains intellectual property rights, the user licenses Google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize the advertising and other services that Google provides to the user and to promote the service. Summarized, he wrote that \"According to its terms, Google does not own user-uploaded files to Google Drive, but the company can do whatever it likes with them\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Zack |last=Whittaker |title=Who owns your files on Google Drive? |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/who-owns-your-files-on-google-drive/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref> In a highly critical editorial of the service, Ed Bott of ''[[ZDNet]]'' wrote that language in the agreements contained \"exact same words\" as Dropbox used in a July 2011 Privacy Policy update that sparked criticism and forced Dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language, adding that \"It's a perfect example of Google's inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the Googleplex\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Bott |title=Google clones Dropbox: lock, stock, and privacy gaffe |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-clones-dropbox-lock-stock-and-privacy-gaffe/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> Matt Peckham of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the lack of unique service agreements for Drive, writing that \"If any Google service warrants privacy firewalling, it\u2019s Google Drive.

Launched on April 24, 2012, Google Drive allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and [[file sharing|share files]]. In addition to a [[web application|website]], Google Drive offers apps with offline capabilities for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] computers, and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] smartphones and tablets. Google Drive encompasses [[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], and [[Google Slides]], which are a part of an [[office suite]] that permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more. Files created and edited through the office suite are saved in Google Drive.\n\nGoogle Drive offers users 15&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s of free storage through [[Google One]]. Google One also offers 100&nbsp;gigabytes, 200&nbsp;gigabytes, 2&nbsp;[[terabyte]]s, 10&nbsp;terabytes, 20&nbsp;terabytes, and 30&nbsp;terabytes offered through optional paid plans. Files uploaded can be up to 5&nbsp;terabytes in size. Users can change privacy settings for individual files and folders, including enabling sharing with other users or making content public. On the website, users can search for an image by describing its visuals, and use [[natural language processing|natural language]] to find specific files, such as \"find my budget spreadsheet from last December\".\n\nThe website and Android app offer a Backups section to see what Android devices have data backed up to the service, and a completely overhauled computer app released in July 2017 allows for backing up specific folders on the user's computer. A Quick Access feature can [[Machine learning|intelligently predict]] the files users need.\n\nGoogle Drive is a key component of [[G Suite]], Google's monthly subscription offering for businesses and organizations. As part of select G Suite plans, Drive offers unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting, enhanced administration controls, and greater collaboration tools for teams.\n\nFollowing the launch of the service, Google Drive's privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media. Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create [[derivative work]]s from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the right to use the information and data to customize the advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services, but that the competition uses \"more artful language\" in the agreements, and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to \"move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails\".\n\n{{As of|2017|3}}, Google Drive has 800&nbsp;million active users, and as of September 2015, it has over one million organizational paying users. {{As of|2017|5}}, there are over two trillion files stored on the service.\n\n== Platforms ==\n{{infobox software\n| name = Google Drive\n| logo = Google Drive logo.svg\n| screenshot = [[File:Screenshot of Google Drive app for Android.png|237px]]\n| operating system = [[Chrome OS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]]\n| programming language = [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (back-end), [[Objective-C]] (Mac client), [[wxPython]] (Windows client)<ref>{{cite web |title=Open source components and licenses |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/1716931 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref>\n| ver layout = stacked\n| latest release version <!-- List platforms that are still being officially developed by Google --> = {{Multiple releases\n|branch1 = Android\n|version1 = 2.20.061.04\n|date1 = {{Start date and age|2020|02|13}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/drive/|title=Google Drive APKs|website=APKMirror|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n|branch2 = iOS\n|version2 = 4.2019.42202\n|date2 = {{Start date and age|2019|10|22}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.apple.com/app/id507874739|title=Google Drive|website=App Store|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> }}\n| license = [[Freeware]]\n| website = {{url|https://www.google.com/drive/}}\n| caption = Google Drive's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app\n}}\n\nGoogle Drive was introduced on April 24, 2012 with apps available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], as well as a [[web application|website interface]].<ref name=\"Introducing Google Drive\">{{cite web |first=Sundar |last=Pichai |title=Introducing Google Drive... yes, really |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2012/04/introducing-google-drive-yes-really.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> The iOS app was released later in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sean |last=Gallagher |title=Hands-on with the Google Drive for iOS app: mostly read only |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/06/hands-on-with-the-google-drive-for-ios-app-mostly-read-only/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=June 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Computer apps ===\n\nGoogle Drive is available for PCs running [[Windows 7]] or later, and Macs running [[Mac OS X Lion|OS X Lion]] or later.<ref>{{cite web |title=System requirements and browsers |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375082 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}</ref> Google indicated in April 2012 that work on Linux software was underway,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/254488/google_drive_for_linux_is_on_the_way.html|title=Google Drive for Linux Is on the Way|last=Noyes|first=Katherine|date=April 25, 2012|website=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> but there was no news on this as of November 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-drive-for-linux-patience-patience/ |title=Google Drive for Linux?

However, if the account lapsed for any reason, users had to choose from current plans.\n\n== Features ==\n=== Sharing ===\nGoogle Drive incorporates a system of file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder is, by default, its owner. The owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder. Ownership is transferable. Files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a [[Google account]], using their ''@gmail.com'' email addresses. Sharing files with users not having a Google account requires making them accessible to \"anybody with the link\". This generates a secret URL for the file, which may be shared via email or private messages. Files and folders can also be made \"public on the web\", which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone. The owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions. The three access levels offered are \"can edit\", \"can comment\" and \"can view\". Users with editing access can invite others to edit.\n\n=== Third-party apps ===\nA number of external [[web application]]s that work with Google Drive are available from the [[Chrome Web Store]]. To add an app, users are required to sign into the Chrome Web Store, but the apps are compatible with all supported web browsers. Some of these apps are first-party, such as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Drive apps operate on the online files and can be used to view, edit and create files in various formats, edit images and videos, fax and sign documents, manage projects, create flowcharts, etc. Drive apps can also be made the default for handling file formats supported by them. Some of these apps also work offline on [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chrome OS]].<ref name=\"about third-party apps\">{{cite web |title=Use Google Drive apps |url=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2500820 |website=Drive Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Chitu |title=Chrome and Google Drive's Third-Party Apps |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.no/2012/04/chrome-and-google-drives-third-party.html |date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAll of the third-party apps are free to install.

It allows users to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations online while collaborating in real-time with other users. The three apps are available as [[web application]]s, as [[Chrome app]]s that work offline, and as [[mobile app]]s for Android and iOS. The apps are compatible with [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. The suite also consists of [[Google Forms]], [[Google Drawings]] and [[Google Fusion Tables]] (retired in December 2019). While Forms and Tables are only available as web applications, Drawings is also available as a Chrome app. The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive, and all files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive.\n\n===Updates===\n\nUpdates to Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms have introduced features using [[machine learning]], including \"Explore\", offering search results based on the contents of a document, answers based on [[Natural language processing|natural language]] questions in a spreadsheet, and dynamic design suggestions based on contents of a slideshow, and \"Action items\", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.\nWhile Google Docs has been criticized for lacking the functionality of [[Microsoft Office]], it has received praise for its simplicity, ease of collaboration and frequent product updates.\n\nIn order to view and edit Docs, Sheets, or Slides documents offline, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser.

He stated that \"We think the user interface needs a lot more work. It's like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here\". He considered uploading files \"fairly easy\", but noted that folder upload was only supported through the [[Google Chrome]] web browser. The lack of native editing of [[Microsoft Office]] documents was \"annoying\". Regarding Google Drive's computer apps, he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was \"powerful\". He wrote that Drive was \"a great addition to Google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly\", while again criticizing the interface for being \"confusing\" and that the file view was \"not quite intuitive enough\" without file icons. Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app, writing that \"it's a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish\", and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being \"easy\".

In particular, privacy advocates have noted that Google has one unified set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements for all its products and services. In a ''[[CNET]]'' report, Zack Whittaker noted that \"the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users' copyright and intellectual property rights\". In a comparison of Terms of Service agreements between Google Drive and competing cloud storage services [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[OneDrive]], he cited a paragraph stating that Google has broad rights to reproduce, use, and create [[derivative work]]s from content stored on Google Drive, via a license from its users. Although the user retains intellectual property rights, the user licenses Google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize the advertising and other services that Google provides to the user and to promote the service. Summarized, he wrote that \"According to its terms, Google does not own user-uploaded files to Google Drive, but the company can do whatever it likes with them\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Zack |last=Whittaker |title=Who owns your files on Google Drive? |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/who-owns-your-files-on-google-drive/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref> In a highly critical editorial of the service, Ed Bott of ''[[ZDNet]]'' wrote that language in the agreements contained \"exact same words\" as Dropbox used in a July 2011 Privacy Policy update that sparked criticism and forced Dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language, adding that \"It's a perfect example of Google's inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the Googleplex\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Bott |title=Google clones Dropbox: lock, stock, and privacy gaffe |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-clones-dropbox-lock-stock-and-privacy-gaffe/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> Matt Peckham of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the lack of unique service agreements for Drive, writing that \"If any Google service warrants privacy firewalling, it\u2019s Google Drive.

During this period, the French carried out many arrests and [[deportation|deported]] resisters, mainly to [[New Caledonia]] (see: \"[[Algerians of the Pacific]]\").

[[Messali Hadj]], [[Imache Amar]], [[Si Djilani]], and [[Belkacem Radjef]] rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s. They developed militants who became vital to the fighting for an independent Algeria. This became widespread after World War II.\n\nSince Algeria gained independence in 1962, tensions have arisen between Kabylie and the central government on several occasions. In July 1962, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] (National Liberation Front) was split rather than united. Indeed, many actors who contributed to independence wanted a share of power but the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] (National Liberation Army) directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]] joined by [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] seemed to had the upper hand because they of their military forces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] party of [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]] contested the authority of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], which had promoted itself as the only party in the nation. A\u00eft Ahmed and others consider that the central government led by [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]] is authoritarian and on September the 3<sup>rd</sup> 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] (Socialist Forces front) was created by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monbeig|first=Pierre|date=1992|title=Une opposition politique dans l'impasse.

But after Mohand Ouelhadj\u2019s defection, A\u00eft Ahmed could barely sustain the movement and after the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] congress on April 16<sup>th</sup> 1964 which reinforced the government\u2019s legitimacy, he was arrested on October 1964. As a consequence, the insurrection was a failure in 1965 because it was hugely repressed by the forces of the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]]. In 1965 [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed|A\u00eft Ahmed]] was sentenced to death, but was later pardoned by [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]].

In 1994\u20131995, the Kabyle conducted a school boycott, termed the \"strike of the school bag\". In June and July 1998, they protested, in events that turned violent, after the assassination of singer [[Matoub Lounes]] and passage of the law requiring use of Arabic in all fields.\n\nIn the months following April 2001 (called the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]]), major riots among the Kabyle took place following the killing of [[Masinissa Guermah]], a young Kabyle, by gendarmes. At the same time, organized activism produced the ''[[Arouch]]'', and neo-traditional local councils. The protests gradually decreased after the Kabyle won some concessions from President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]].\n\nOn 6 January 2016, Tamazight was officially recognized in Algeria's constitution as a language that was equal to Arabic.<ref name=\"APS\">{{cite web |url=http://constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/algeria_french.pdf |title=AVANT PROJET DE REVISION DE LA CONSTITUTION |publisher=[[Algeria Press Service]] |date=6 January 2016 |access-date=28 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Kabyle-speaking-map.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=2| Regions of Kabyle settlements in Algeria]]\n\nThe geography of the Kabyle region played an important role in the people's history. The difficult mountainous landscape of the [[Tizi Ouzou Province|Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Bejaia Province|Bejaia]] provinces served as a refuge, to which most of the Kabyle people retreated when under pressure or occupation. They were able to preserve their cultural heritage in such isolation from other cultural influences.\n\nThe area supported local dynasties (Numidia, Fatimids in the Kutama periods, Zirids, Hammadids, and Hafsids of Beja\u00efa) or Algerian modern nationalism, and the war of independence. The region was repeatedly occupied by various conquerors. Romans and Byzantines controlled the main road and valley during the period of antiquity and avoided the mountains (Mont ferratus).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmatheque.com/ebook/la-kabylie-orientale-dans-l-histoire-pays-des-kutuma-et-guerre-coloniale-39716|title=Ebook LA KABYLIE ORIENTALE DANS L'HISTOIRE - Pays des Kutuma et guerre coloniale de Hosni Kitouni|website=www.harmatheque.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> [[Spread of Islam|During the spread of Islam]], Arabs controlled plains but not all the countryside (they were called ''el aadua'' : enemy by the Kabyle).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdelfettah Lalmi|first=Nedjma|date=2004-01-01|title=Du mythe de l'isolat kabyle|journal=Cahiers d'\u00c9tudes Africaines|language=fr|volume=44|issue=175|pages=507\u2013531|doi=10.4000/etudesafricaines.4710|issn=0008-0055}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Regency of Algiers]], under Ottoman influence, tried to have indirect influence over the people (makhzen tribes of Amraoua, and marabout).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/kabyles/|title=KABYLES|last=Universalis|first=Encyclop\u00e6dia|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe French gradually and totally conquered the region and set up a direct administration. [[File:Djurdjura.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[Djurdjura]] chain]]\n[[File:Kabylie topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|200px|Topographic map of Kabylia.]]\nAlgerian provinces with significant Kabyle-speaking populations include [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]] and [[Bouira]], where they are a majority, as well as [[Boumerdes]], [[Setif]], [[Bordj Bou Arreridj]], and [[Jijel]]. [[Algiers]] also has a significant Kabyle population, where they make up more than half of the capital's population.\n\nThe Kabyle region is referred to as ''Al Qabayel'' (\"tribes\") by the Arabic-speaking population and as ''Kabylie'' in French. Its indigenous inhabitants call it ''Tamurt Idurar'' (\"Land of Mountains\") or ''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen''/''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen'' (\"Land of the Kabyle\"). It is part of the [[Atlas Mountains]] and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Kabyle speak [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], a [[Berber language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] family. As second and third languages, many people speak [[Algerian Arabic]], [[French language|French]] and, to a lesser degree [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used the [[Tifinagh]] writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the [[Latin script]]. It is the basis for the modern [[Berber Latin alphabet]].\n\nAfter the [[History of Algeria|independence of Algeria]], some Kabyle activists tried to revive the old Tifinagh alphabet. This new version of Tifinagh has been called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], but its use remains limited to [[logo]]s. Kabyle literature has continued to be written in the Latin script.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Kabyle people are mainly [[Muslim]], with a small [[Christians|Christian]] minority.<ref>Abdelmadjid Hannoum, ''Violent Modernity: France in Algeria'', Page 124, 2010, Harvard Center for Middle Eastern studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts.Amar Boulifa, ''Le Djurdjura \u00e0 travers l'histoire depuis l'Antiquit\u00e9 jusqu'en 1830 : organisation et ind\u00e9pendance des Zouaoua (Grande Kabylie)'', Page 197, 1925, Algiers.</ref> Many [[Zaouia]] exist all over the region; the [[Rahmaniyya]] is the most prolific.\n\n[[Catholic]]s of Kabyle background generally live in France and result from intermarriage with the French. Recently, the Protestant community has had significant growth, particularly among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] denominations.<ref>Lucien Oulahbib, ''Le monde arabe existe-t-il ?'', page 12, 2005, Editions de Paris, Paris.</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\nThe traditional economy of the area is based on [[arboriculture]] ([[orchard]]s and [[olive tree]]s) and on the craft industry ([[tapestry]] or [[pottery]]). Mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary). In the middle of the 20th century, with the influence and funding by the Kabyle diaspora, many industries were developed in this region. It has become the second most important industrial region in the country after Algiers.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Politics ==\nThe Kabyle have been fierce activists in promoting the cause of Berber (''Amazigh'') identity. The movement has three groups: those Kabyle who identify as part of a larger Berber nation ([[Berberism|Berberists]]); those who identify as part of the Algerian nation (known as \"Algerianists\", some view Algeria as an essentially Berber nation); and those who consider the Kabyle to be a distinct nation separate from (but akin to) other Berber peoples (known as [[Kabylism|Kabylists]]).\n* Two political parties dominate in Kabylie and have their principal support base there: the [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS), led by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]], and the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD), led by [[Sa\u00efd Sadi]]. Both parties are [[secularist]], [[Berberist]] and [[Algerianist]].\n* The Arouch emerged during the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]] of 2001 as a revival of the village assembly, a traditional Kabyle form of democratic organization. The Arouch share roughly the same political views as the FFS and the RCD.\n* The [[Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie|MAK (Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie)]] also emerged during the Black Spring, It claimed the right for a regional autonomy of Kabylie.

[[Messali Hadj]], [[Imache Amar]], [[Si Djilani]], and [[Belkacem Radjef]] rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s. They developed militants who became vital to the fighting for an independent Algeria. This became widespread after World War II.\n\nSince Algeria gained independence in 1962, tensions have arisen between Kabylie and the central government on several occasions. In July 1962, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] (National Liberation Front) was split rather than united. Indeed, many actors who contributed to independence wanted a share of power but the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] (National Liberation Army) directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]] joined by [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] seemed to had the upper hand because they of their military forces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] party of [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]] contested the authority of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], which had promoted itself as the only party in the nation. A\u00eft Ahmed and others consider that the central government led by [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]] is authoritarian and on September the 3<sup>rd</sup> 1963 the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]] (Socialist Forces front) was created by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monbeig|first=Pierre|date=1992|title=Une opposition politique dans l'impasse.

As a consequence, the insurrection was a failure in 1965 because it was hugely repressed by the forces of the [[National Liberation Army (Algeria)|ALN]] directed by [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne|Houari Boumediene]]. In 1965 [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed|A\u00eft Ahmed]] was sentenced to death, but was later pardoned by [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]].

In 1994\u20131995, the Kabyle conducted a school boycott, termed the \"strike of the school bag\". In June and July 1998, they protested, in events that turned violent, after the assassination of singer [[Matoub Lounes]] and passage of the law requiring use of Arabic in all fields.\n\nIn the months following April 2001 (called the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]]), major riots among the Kabyle took place following the killing of [[Masinissa Guermah]], a young Kabyle, by gendarmes. At the same time, organized activism produced the ''[[Arouch]]'', and neo-traditional local councils. The protests gradually decreased after the Kabyle won some concessions from President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]].\n\nOn 6 January 2016, Tamazight was officially recognized in Algeria's constitution as a language that was equal to Arabic.<ref name=\"APS\">{{cite web |url=http://constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/algeria_french.pdf |title=AVANT PROJET DE REVISION DE LA CONSTITUTION |publisher=[[Algeria Press Service]] |date=6 January 2016 |access-date=28 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Kabyle-speaking-map.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=2| Regions of Kabyle settlements in Algeria]]\n\nThe geography of the Kabyle region played an important role in the people's history. The difficult mountainous landscape of the [[Tizi Ouzou Province|Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Bejaia Province|Bejaia]] provinces served as a refuge, to which most of the Kabyle people retreated when under pressure or occupation. They were able to preserve their cultural heritage in such isolation from other cultural influences.\n\nThe area supported local dynasties (Numidia, Fatimids in the Kutama periods, Zirids, Hammadids, and Hafsids of Beja\u00efa) or Algerian modern nationalism, and the war of independence. The region was repeatedly occupied by various conquerors. Romans and Byzantines controlled the main road and valley during the period of antiquity and avoided the mountains (Mont ferratus).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmatheque.com/ebook/la-kabylie-orientale-dans-l-histoire-pays-des-kutuma-et-guerre-coloniale-39716|title=Ebook LA KABYLIE ORIENTALE DANS L'HISTOIRE - Pays des Kutuma et guerre coloniale de Hosni Kitouni|website=www.harmatheque.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> [[Spread of Islam|During the spread of Islam]], Arabs controlled plains but not all the countryside (they were called ''el aadua'' : enemy by the Kabyle).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdelfettah Lalmi|first=Nedjma|date=2004-01-01|title=Du mythe de l'isolat kabyle|journal=Cahiers d'\u00c9tudes Africaines|language=fr|volume=44|issue=175|pages=507\u2013531|doi=10.4000/etudesafricaines.4710|issn=0008-0055}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Regency of Algiers]], under Ottoman influence, tried to have indirect influence over the people (makhzen tribes of Amraoua, and marabout).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/kabyles/|title=KABYLES|last=Universalis|first=Encyclop\u00e6dia|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe French gradually and totally conquered the region and set up a direct administration. [[File:Djurdjura.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[Djurdjura]] chain]]\n[[File:Kabylie topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|200px|Topographic map of Kabylia.]]\nAlgerian provinces with significant Kabyle-speaking populations include [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]] and [[Bouira]], where they are a majority, as well as [[Boumerdes]], [[Setif]], [[Bordj Bou Arreridj]], and [[Jijel]]. [[Algiers]] also has a significant Kabyle population, where they make up more than half of the capital's population.\n\nThe Kabyle region is referred to as ''Al Qabayel'' (\"tribes\") by the Arabic-speaking population and as ''Kabylie'' in French. Its indigenous inhabitants call it ''Tamurt Idurar'' (\"Land of Mountains\") or ''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen''/''Tamurt n Iqbayliyen'' (\"Land of the Kabyle\"). It is part of the [[Atlas Mountains]] and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Kabyle speak [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], a [[Berber language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] family. As second and third languages, many people speak [[Algerian Arabic]], [[French language|French]] and, to a lesser degree [[English language|English]].\n\nDuring the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used the [[Tifinagh]] writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the [[Latin script]]. It is the basis for the modern [[Berber Latin alphabet]].\n\nAfter the [[History of Algeria|independence of Algeria]], some Kabyle activists tried to revive the old Tifinagh alphabet. This new version of Tifinagh has been called [[Neo-Tifinagh]], but its use remains limited to [[logo]]s. Kabyle literature has continued to be written in the Latin script.\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Kabyle people are mainly [[Muslim]], with a small [[Christians|Christian]] minority.<ref>Abdelmadjid Hannoum, ''Violent Modernity: France in Algeria'', Page 124, 2010, Harvard Center for Middle Eastern studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts.Amar Boulifa, ''Le Djurdjura \u00e0 travers l'histoire depuis l'Antiquit\u00e9 jusqu'en 1830 : organisation et ind\u00e9pendance des Zouaoua (Grande Kabylie)'', Page 197, 1925, Algiers.</ref> Many [[Zaouia]] exist all over the region; the [[Rahmaniyya]] is the most prolific.\n\n[[Catholic]]s of Kabyle background generally live in France and result from intermarriage with the French.

Mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary). In the middle of the 20th century, with the influence and funding by the Kabyle diaspora, many industries were developed in this region. It has become the second most important industrial region in the country after Algiers.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Politics ==\nThe Kabyle have been fierce activists in promoting the cause of Berber (''Amazigh'') identity. The movement has three groups: those Kabyle who identify as part of a larger Berber nation ([[Berberism|Berberists]]); those who identify as part of the Algerian nation (known as \"Algerianists\", some view Algeria as an essentially Berber nation); and those who consider the Kabyle to be a distinct nation separate from (but akin to) other Berber peoples (known as [[Kabylism|Kabylists]]).\n* Two political parties dominate in Kabylie and have their principal support base there: the [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS), led by [[Hocine A\u00eft Ahmed]], and the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD), led by [[Sa\u00efd Sadi]]. Both parties are [[secularist]], [[Berberist]] and [[Algerianist]].\n* The Arouch emerged during the [[Black Spring (Kabylie)|Black Spring]] of 2001 as a revival of the village assembly, a traditional Kabyle form of democratic organization. The Arouch share roughly the same political views as the FFS and the RCD.\n* The [[Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie|MAK (Movement for the Autonomy of Kabylie)]] also emerged during the Black Spring, It claimed the right for a regional autonomy of Kabylie. On 21 April 2010, MAK proclaimed a Provisional Government of Kabylie in exile (ANAVAD).

{"title_page": "Chatbot", "text_new": "{{short description|Program that simulates conversation}}The term '''Chatbot''' refers to a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.  Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse or pass the industry standard Turing test.  The term \"ChatterBot\" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs. \n\nChatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various purposes including customer service, request routing, or for information gathering.  While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, y processors, and sophisticated AI, others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or database.  \n\nToday, most chat it's are accessed on-line via website popups, or through virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat. Chat it's are typically classified into usage categories that include: commerce (e-commerce via chat), \n\n, entertainment, finance, health, news, and productivity.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1950, [[Alan Turing]]'s famous article \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\" was published,<ref>{{Harv|Turing|1950}}</ref> which proposed what is now called the [[Turing test]] as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a [[computer program]] to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably\u2014on the basis of the conversational content alone\u2014between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s program [[ELIZA]], published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:\n\n<blockquote>[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... The observer says to himself \"I could have written that\". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios ... The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". Few programs ever needed it more.<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|p=36}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|pp=44\u20135}}</ref> Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are ''capable of being interpreted'' as \"intelligent\".\n\nInterface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational\u2014even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching\u2014can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".\n\n==Development==\nAmong the most notable early chatbots are [[ELIZA]] (1966) and [[PARRY]] (1972).<ref name=\"G\u00fczeldere\">{{Harvnb|G\u00fczeldereFranchi|1995}}</ref><ref name=\"comphis\">{{Harvnb|Computer History Museum|2006}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sondheim|1997}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Network Working Group|1973}}\u2014Transcript of a session between Parry and Eliza. (This is ''not'' the dialogue from the ICCC, which took place October 24\u201326, 1972, whereas this session is from September 18, 1972.)</ref> More recent notable programs include [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|A.L.I.C.E.]], [[Jabberwacky]] and D.U.D.E ([[Agence Nationale de la Recherche]] and [[CNRS]] 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called ''The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed'' was published, allegedly written by the chatbot [[Racter]] (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).<ref>[http://everything2.com/title/The+Policeman%2527s+Beard+is+Half+Constructed www.everything.com] 13 November 1999</ref>\n\nOne pertinent field of AI research is [[natural language processing]]. Usually, [[Artificial general intelligence|weak AI]] fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a [[markup language]] called [[AIML]], which is specific to its function as a [[dialogue system|conversational agent]], and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called, [[Alicebot]]s. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on [[pattern matching]] techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require [[sapience]] and logical reasoning abilities.\n\nJabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with [[evolutionary algorithm]]s that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, [[information retrieval]].\n\nChatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the [[Loebner Prize]] and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schwaebische.de/archiv_artikel,-Chatroboter-simulieren-Menschen-_arid,855141.html|title=Chatroboter simulieren Menschen}}</ref>\n\n[[DBpedia]] created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chat.dbpedia.org/|title=DBpedia Chatbot|website=chat.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.dbpedia.org/blog/meet-dbpedia-chatbot|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot &#124; DBpedia|website=wiki.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.dbpedia.org/2018/08/22/dbpedia-chatbot-2/|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot|date=August 22, 2018}}</ref> and can communicate through Facebook Messenger.

However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health. The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%).

This criterion depends on the ability of a [[computer program]] to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably\u2014on the basis of the conversational content alone\u2014between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s program [[ELIZA]], published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:\n\n<blockquote>[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... The observer says to himself \"I could have written that\". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios ... The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". Few programs ever needed it more.<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|p=36}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').<ref>{{Harv|Weizenbaum|1966|pp=44\u20135}}</ref> Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are ''capable of being interpreted'' as \"intelligent\".\n\nInterface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational\u2014even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching\u2014can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".\n\n==Development==\nAmong the most notable early chatbots are [[ELIZA]] (1966) and [[PARRY]] (1972).<ref name=\"G\u00fczeldere\">{{Harvnb|G\u00fczeldereFranchi|1995}}</ref><ref name=\"comphis\">{{Harvnb|Computer History Museum|2006}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sondheim|1997}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Network Working Group|1973}}\u2014Transcript of a session between Parry and Eliza. (This is ''not'' the dialogue from the ICCC, which took place October 24\u201326, 1972, whereas this session is from September 18, 1972.)</ref> More recent notable programs include [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|A.L.I.C.E.]], [[Jabberwacky]] and D.U.D.E ([[Agence Nationale de la Recherche]] and [[CNRS]] 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called ''The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed'' was published, allegedly written by the chatbot [[Racter]] (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).<ref>[http://everything2.com/title/The+Policeman%2527s+Beard+is+Half+Constructed www.everything.com] 13 November 1999</ref>\n\nOne pertinent field of AI research is [[natural language processing]]. Usually, [[Artificial general intelligence|weak AI]] fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a [[markup language]] called [[AIML]], which is specific to its function as a [[dialogue system|conversational agent]], and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called, [[Alicebot]]s. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on [[pattern matching]] techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require [[sapience]] and logical reasoning abilities.\n\nJabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with [[evolutionary algorithm]]s that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, [[information retrieval]].\n\nChatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the [[Loebner Prize]] and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schwaebische.de/archiv_artikel,-Chatroboter-simulieren-Menschen-_arid,855141.html|title=Chatroboter simulieren Menschen}}</ref>\n\n[[DBpedia]] created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chat.dbpedia.org/|title=DBpedia Chatbot|website=chat.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.dbpedia.org/blog/meet-dbpedia-chatbot|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot &#124; DBpedia|website=wiki.dbpedia.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.dbpedia.org/2018/08/22/dbpedia-chatbot-2/|title=Meet the DBpedia Chatbot|date=August 22, 2018}}</ref> and can communicate through Facebook Messenger.

The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information (78%), booking a medical appointment (78%) and looking for local health services (80%). However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health. The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%). While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea. Interestingly, 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot. Therefore, perceived trustworthiness, individual attitudes towards bots and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots.\n\n===Politics===\nIn New Zealand, the chatbot SAM -short for [[Semantic analysis (machine learning)|Semantic Analysis Machine-]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tuiainnovation.com/sam%2c-the-virtual-politician|title=Sam, the virtual politician|website=Tuia Innovation}}</ref> (made by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/news/2017/12/meet-the-worlds-first-virtual-politician|title=Meet the world's first virtual politician|first=Victoria University of|last=Wellington|date=December 15, 2017|website=Victoria University of Wellington}}</ref>) has been developed.

[[Zaire]] is renamed the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].\n**The [[Second Congo War]] starts in 1998 in central Africa and includes 50 different cultures and 7 different nations.

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.\n*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994\u20131996) \u2013 the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. After the initial campaign of 1994\u20131995, culminating in the devastating [[Battle of Grozny (August 1996)|Battle of Grozny]], Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya but were set back by Chechen [[guerrilla warfare]] and raids on the flatlands in spite of Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and [[air support]]. The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]]. During the war Russian forces largely recaptured the separatist region of [[Chechnya]].<ref>GlobalSecurity.org, [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm Second Chechnya War \u2013 1999\u2013???]</ref> The campaign largely reversed the outcome of the [[First Chechen War]], in which the region gained de facto [[independence]] as the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].\n*The [[Kargil War]] (1999) \u2013 In May 1999, Pakistan sent troops covertly to occupy strategic peaks in [[Kashmir]]. A month later the [[Kargil War]] with India results in a political fiasco for Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], followed by a Pakistani military withdrawal to the [[Line of Control]]. The incident leads to a military [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in October, in which Sharif is ousted by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army Chief]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].

The [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992\u20131995) marked the most violent [[urban warfare]] in Europe since World War II at that time as [[Serbs|Serb]] forces bombard and attack [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] controlled and populated areas of the city. War crimes occur including [[ethnic cleansing]] and destruction of civilian property.\n**The final fighting in Croatian and Bosnian wars ends in 1995 with the success of Croatian military offensives against Serb forces and the mass exodus of [[Serbs]] from Croatia in 1995; Serb losses to Croat and Bosniak forces; and finally the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] which internally partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a [[Republika Srpska]] and a [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat federation]].\n*[[Kosovo War]] (1998\u20131999) \u2013 the war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb paramilitary forces in [[Kosovo]] begins in 1996 and escalates in 1998 with increasing reports of atrocities taking place.\n**In 1999, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) led by the United States launched [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|air attacks]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (then composed of only [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in [[Kosovo]] due to accusations of war crimes being committed by Yugoslav military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups.

This attempt did not succeed and Clinton continued to serve as the president until the end of his term in January 2001.]] The enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on 1 January 1994, creating a North American free trade zone consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the United States\n\n=====Canada=====\n*Canadian politics is radically altered in the 1993 federal election with the collapse of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]], (a major political party in Canada since 1867) from being in government to only 2 seats and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] collapsing from 44 seats to 9. The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] is the only genuine national political party that remains while the regionally based parties such as the Quebec-based [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] and the almost entirely Western Canada-based [[Reform Party of Canada]] rise from political insignificance to being major political parties.\n*After the collapse of the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake constitutional accord]] in 1990, the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada experienced a rekindled wave of separatism by [[francophone]] [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois people|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] nationalists, who sought for Quebec to become an independent country. In 1995, during a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, Quebec voters narrowly reject the vote for independence.\n*The [[1995 Quebec independence referendum|1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty]] is held in the predominantly [[francophone]] province of [[Quebec]] in Canada, a majority [[anglophone]] country. If accepted Quebec would become an independent country with an economic association with Canada. The proposal is narrowly rejected by Quebec's voters by 50.4% no, and 49.6% yes.\n\n=====Haiti=====\n*[[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] becomes the first democratically elected President of [[Haiti]] in 1990.\n\n=====United States=====\n*[[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was a dominant political figure in international affairs during the 1990s known especially for his attempts to negotiate peace in the Middle East and end the ongoing wars occurring in the former Yugoslavia; his promotion of international action to decrease human-created [[climate change]]; and his endorsement of advancing [[free trade]] in the Americas.\n*[[Lewinsky scandal]] \u2013 US president [[Bill Clinton]] was caught in a media-frenzied scandal involving inappropriate relations with a White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]], first announced on 21 January 1998. After the United States House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached Clinton]] on 19 December 1998 for perjury under oath, following an investigation by federal prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]], the Senate acquitted Clinton of the charges on 12 February 1999 and he finished his second term.\n*California voters passed [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] in 1996, to legalize [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for medicinal purposes. The debate over legalization of marijuana in the United States goes on today.\n*The enactment of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) on 1 January 1994, creating a North American [[free trade]] zone consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\n\n====Asia====\n=====Middle East=====\n[[File:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] during the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] on 13 September 1993.]]\n*In 1990, the ending of the civil war and the return to political normalcy in [[Lebanon]] began. With the peace among all factions in Lebanon, the rebuilding of Lebanon and its capital, Beirut, started.\n*[[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Yasser Arafat]] agree to the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process]] at the culmination of the [[Oslo Accords]], negotiated by the [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 13 September 1993. By signing the Oslo accords, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] recognize Israel's right to exist, while Israel permitted the creation of an autonomous [[Palestinian National Authority]] consisting of the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] which was implemented in 1994. Israeli military forces withdraw from the Palestinian territories in compliance with the accord, which marked the end of the [[First Intifada]] (a period of violence between Palestinian Arab militants and Israeli armed forces from 1987 to 1993).\n*The [[Palestinian National Authority]] is created in 1994 in accordance with the Oslo Accords, giving Palestinian Arab people official autonomy over the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]], though not official independence from [[Israel]].\n*In 1994, a peace treaty is signed between [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]].\n*[[North Yemen]] and [[South Yemen]] merge to form [[Yemen]] in 1991.\n\n=====Far East=====\n*[[Lee Kuan Yew]] relinquished prime-ministership of [[Singapore]] on 28 November 1990, a position he held since 1959, to [[Goh Chok Tong]]. He remained in the cabinet as Senior Minister.\n*In July 1994, North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] died, having ruled the country since its founding in 1948. His son [[Kim Jong-il]] succeeded him, taking over a nation on the brink of complete economic collapse. Famine caused a great number of deaths in the late '90s, and [[North Korea]] would gain a reputation for being a large source of money laundering, counterfeiting, and weapons proliferation. The country's ability to produce and sell nuclear weapons became a focus of concern in the international community.\n*[[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s [[National League for Democracy]] in Burma wins a majority of seats in the first free elections in 30 years in 1990, yet the Burmese [[military junta]] refuses to relinquish power, beginning an ongoing peaceful struggle throughout the 1990s to the present by Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters to demand the end of military rule in Burma.\n*In the [[Philippines]] two Presidents were elected, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in 1992 and [[Joseph Estrada]] in 1998.\n*Indonesian president [[Suharto]] resigned after ruling for 32 years (1966\u20131998).\n\n====Europe====\n*The improvement in relations between the countries of [[NATO]] and the former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] ended the [[Cold War]] both in Europe and other parts of the world.\n*[[German reunification]] \u2013 Germany reunified on 3 October 1990 as a result of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and after integrating the economic structure and provincial governments, focused on modernization of the former communist East. People who were brought up in a socialist culture became integrated with those living in capitalist western Germany.\n*[[Margaret Thatcher]], who had been the United Kingdom's Prime Minister since 1979, resigned as Prime Minister on 22 November 1990 after being challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by [[Michael Heseltine]]. This was because of widespread opposition to the introduction of the controversial [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], and the fact that her key allies such as [[Nigel Lawson]] and [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigned over the deeply sensitive issues of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and Margaret Thatcher's resistance to Britain joining the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Less than two years later on the infamous [[Black Wednesday]] of September 1992, the [[pound sterling]] crashed out of the system after the pound fell below the agreed exchange rate with the [[Deutsche Mark]].\n*[[John Major]] replaces [[Margaret Thatcher]] as Prime Minister in 1990.\n*The [[Perestroika|restructuring]] of the Soviet Union destabilizes, as nationalist and separatist demagogues gain popularity. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then [[Chairmen of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets|chairman]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] of [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], resigns from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and becomes the opposition leader against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The Communist Party loses its status as the governing force of the country and is banned after a [[August Putsch|coup attempt]] by Communist hardliners attempted to revert the effects of Gorbachev's policies. Yeltsin's counter-revolution is victorious on 25 December 1991 with the resignation of Gorbachev from presidency and the [[dissolution of the USSR]]. Yeltsin became president of the successor Russian Federation and presided over a period of political unrest, economic crisis, and social anarchy. On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin resigned leaving [[Vladimir Putin]] as acting president.\n*The [[European Union]] forms in 1992 under the [[Maastricht Treaty]].\n*The [[Downing Street Declaration]] 15 December 1993 by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[John Major]], and the [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland, [[Albert Reynolds]] at the British Prime Minister's office in [[10 Downing Street]]. It affirmed both the right of the people of Ireland to [[self-determination]], and that [[Northern Ireland]] would be transferred to the [[Republic of Ireland]] from the United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It included, as part of the prospective of the so-called \"Irish dimension\", the [[principle of consent]] that the people of the island of Ireland, had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.<ref>\nPeatling, Gary (2004).

This marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the IRA and the United Kingdom, and the start of political negotiations.\n*[[Tony Blair]] becomes Prime Minister in 1997 following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]].\n*The [[Belfast Agreement]] (a.k.a. the Good Friday Agreement) is signed by U.K. and Irish politicians on 10 April 1998, declaring a joint commitment to a peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the United Kingdom over [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum]] was held on 22 May 1998. There was a large majority of 'Yes'. A total of 1,738 ballots were spoiled. Turnout, at 81.1% was very high for a developed country where voting is not compulsory.<ref name=ARK01>ARK: Northern Ireland Elections, [http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fref98.htm The 1998 Referendums]</ref> Turnout in the equivalent referendum in the Republic of Ireland was average for a constitutional referendum but returned almost universal approval (94.39%).\n*The [[National Assembly for Wales]] established following the [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum]] was held on 18 September 1997 in which voters approved the creation of the National Assembly for Wales by a majority of 6,712 votes, or 50.3% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/analysis/rozenberg2.shtml Politics 97] by Joshua Rozenberg: BBC website.

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

The transformation from forest to farm is evident by the paler square shaped areas under development.]]\nAt the beginning of the decade, [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental protection]] became serious issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.\n\n==Society==\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\n[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and \"retro\" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in [[extreme sports]] and outdoor activities that combined embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.\n\nThose born in the 1990s are usually considered part of the [[Millennials|Millennial Generation]], along with those born in the late 1970s and 1980s. However, dates vary, with many demographers considering those born from 1995 onward as part of [[Generation Z]], the post-Millennial generation.<ref name=\"McCrindleAU\">[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf |date=16 June 2016 }}.

In the United States the [[Violence Against Women Act]] was passed, which greatly affected the world community through the United Nations. The law's author, [[Joe Biden]], and UN Ambassador and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton (see below) become vocal advocates of action against violence against women.\n*Women reach great heights of power in the United States government. [[Hillary Clinton]], leading policy proposals, traveling abroad as a State Department representative to 82 nations, advising her husband, and being elected a [[United States Senate|Senator]] (in 2000), is the most openly empowered and politically powerful [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in American history; [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Janet Reno]] take two of [[United States Cabinet|the cabinet]]'s top jobs as [[United States Secretary of State]] (#1), and [[United States Attorney General]] (#4), respectively.

In Turkey, [[Tansu \u00c7iller]] became the first female prime minister in 1993 (till 1996).\n*In popular culture, pop group the [[Spice Girls]] also played a part in the feminist movement, boosting popularity with their slogan \"Girl Power!\", while country music superstar [[Shania Twain]] declared female supremacy in her 1995 hit song \"[[Any Man of Mine]].\"\n\n==Additional significant worldwide events==\n*Worldwide New Year's Eve celebrations on 31 December 1999 welcoming the year 2000.\n\n'''Europe'''<br />\n[[File:Diana's funeral.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]], 1997.]]\n*1991 \u2013 Soviet Union military troops attack [[Lithuania]]n independence supporters in [[Vilnius]], killing 14 people and wounding 1000.\n*In Paris, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and her friend, [[Dodi Al-Fayed]], were killed in a car accident in August 1997, when their chauffeured, hired [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] crashed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel.

Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s.

Rave spawned genres such as [[Intelligent dance music]] and [[Drum and bass]]. The latter is an offshoot of jungle techno and [[Breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]]. Popular artists included [[Moby]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[the Orb]], [[the Chemical Brothers]], [[Basement Jaxx]], [[Todd Terry]], [[808 State]], [[Primal Scream]], [[the Shamen]], [[the KLF]] and [[the Prodigy]].\n\nThe rise of [[industrial music]], somewhat a fusion of [[synthpop]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], rose to worldwide popularity with bands like [[Godflesh]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Rammstein]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. [[Groove metal]] was born through the efforts of [[Pantera]], whose seventh studio album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'' (1994) was notable for going number one on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Another heavy metal subgenre called nu metal, which mixed metal with hip hop influences, becomes popular with bands like [[Korn]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] selling millions of albums worldwide.

Lasting for 9 seasons, the show tackled a wide variety of subjects, and was one of the few shows ever to perform karate.\n\n1993 also saw its debut of the [[medical]]\u2013[[:wikt:mystery|mystery]] drama, ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Dick Van Dyke]], who guest-starred on an episode of its sequel, ''[[Jake and The Fatman]]'', where the show got off to a rocky start, and became one of television's long-running mysteries, that lasted until its cancelation in 2001.\n\nMedical dramas started to come into television in the '90s. One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005\u2013present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\n''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000. It established the teen soap genre paving the way for ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', and other shows airing in later years. The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]].

The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

Specifically ''[[Warner Bros Animation]]'' shows like''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Also syndicated shows like ''[[Phantom 2040]]''.\n\nThe late 90s also saw the evolution of a new TV genre: primetime game shows, popularized by the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', hosted by [[Regis Philbin]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], as well as other first-run game shows aired in primetime on the newly launched [[Game Show Network]].\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1990s in fashion}}\n[[File:Jonathan Brandis Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Grunge]]-style flannel shirt and [[curtained hair]]]]\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1990s include:\n*[[Rachel haircut|The Rachel]], [[Jennifer Aniston]]'s hairstyle on the hit show ''[[Friends]]'', became a cultural phenomenon with millions of women copying it worldwide.\n*The [[Curtained hair|Curtained Haircut]] increased in popularity in fashion and culture among teenage boys and young men in the 1990s, mainly after it was popularized in the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' by the actor [[Edward Furlong]].\n*The model 1300 [[Wonderbra]] style has a resurgence of popularity in Europe in 1992 which kicks off a multinational media sensation, the 1994 re-introduction of \"The Wonderbra\" brand, and a spike in push-up, plunge bras around the world.\n*Additional fashion trends of the 1990s include the [[Tamagotchi]], [[Inline skates|Rollerblades]], [[Pogs]] and [[Dr. Martens]] shoes.\n*Bleached Blond hair became very popular in the late '90s, as was men with short hair with the bangs \"flipped up\".\n*The 1990s also saw the return of '70s teen female fashion with long, straight hair and denim hot pants.\n*''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'' sideburns also became popular in the early and mid-1990s.\n*[[Slap bracelet]]s were a popular fad among children, pre-teens and teenagers in the early 1990s and were available in a wide variety of patterns and colors.

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles.

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.\n*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994\u20131996) \u2013 the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. After the initial campaign of 1994\u20131995, culminating in the devastating [[Battle of Grozny (August 1996)|Battle of Grozny]], Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya but were set back by Chechen [[guerrilla warfare]] and raids on the flatlands in spite of Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and [[air support]]. The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]].

A month later the [[Kargil War]] with India results in a political fiasco for Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], followed by a Pakistani military withdrawal to the [[Line of Control]]. The incident leads to a military [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in October, in which Sharif is ousted by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army Chief]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].

The [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992\u20131995) marked the most violent [[urban warfare]] in Europe since World War II at that time as [[Serbs|Serb]] forces bombard and attack [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] controlled and populated areas of the city. War crimes occur including [[ethnic cleansing]] and destruction of civilian property.\n**The final fighting in Croatian and Bosnian wars ends in 1995 with the success of Croatian military offensives against Serb forces and the mass exodus of [[Serbs]] from Croatia in 1995; Serb losses to Croat and Bosniak forces; and finally the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] which internally partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a [[Republika Srpska]] and a [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat federation]].\n*[[Kosovo War]] (1998\u20131999) \u2013 the war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb paramilitary forces in [[Kosovo]] begins in 1996 and escalates in 1998 with increasing reports of atrocities taking place.\n**In 1999, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) led by the United States launched [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|air attacks]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (then composed of only [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in [[Kosovo]] due to accusations of war crimes being committed by Yugoslav military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups.

The debate over legalization of marijuana in the United States goes on today.\n*The enactment of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) on 1 January 1994, creating a North American [[free trade]] zone consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\n\n====Asia====\n=====Middle East=====\n[[File:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] during the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] on 13 September 1993.]]\n*In 1990, the ending of the civil war and the return to political normalcy in [[Lebanon]] began. With the peace among all factions in Lebanon, the rebuilding of Lebanon and its capital, Beirut, started.\n*[[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Yasser Arafat]] agree to the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process]] at the culmination of the [[Oslo Accords]], negotiated by the [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 13 September 1993. By signing the Oslo accords, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] recognize Israel's right to exist, while Israel permitted the creation of an autonomous [[Palestinian National Authority]] consisting of the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] which was implemented in 1994. Israeli military forces withdraw from the Palestinian territories in compliance with the accord, which marked the end of the [[First Intifada]] (a period of violence between Palestinian Arab militants and Israeli armed forces from 1987 to 1993).\n*The [[Palestinian National Authority]] is created in 1994 in accordance with the Oslo Accords, giving Palestinian Arab people official autonomy over the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]], though not official independence from [[Israel]].\n*In 1994, a peace treaty is signed between [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]].\n*[[North Yemen]] and [[South Yemen]] merge to form [[Yemen]] in 1991.\n\n=====Far East=====\n*[[Lee Kuan Yew]] relinquished prime-ministership of [[Singapore]] on 28 November 1990, a position he held since 1959, to [[Goh Chok Tong]]. He remained in the cabinet as Senior Minister.\n*In July 1994, North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] died, having ruled the country since its founding in 1948. His son [[Kim Jong-il]] succeeded him, taking over a nation on the brink of complete economic collapse. Famine caused a great number of deaths in the late '90s, and [[North Korea]] would gain a reputation for being a large source of money laundering, counterfeiting, and weapons proliferation. The country's ability to produce and sell nuclear weapons became a focus of concern in the international community.\n*[[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s [[National League for Democracy]] in Burma wins a majority of seats in the first free elections in 30 years in 1990, yet the Burmese [[military junta]] refuses to relinquish power, beginning an ongoing peaceful struggle throughout the 1990s to the present by Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters to demand the end of military rule in Burma.\n*In the [[Philippines]] two Presidents were elected, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in 1992 and [[Joseph Estrada]] in 1998.\n*Indonesian president [[Suharto]] resigned after ruling for 32 years (1966\u20131998).\n\n====Europe====\n*The improvement in relations between the countries of [[NATO]] and the former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] ended the [[Cold War]] both in Europe and other parts of the world.\n*[[German reunification]] \u2013 Germany reunified on 3 October 1990 as a result of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and after integrating the economic structure and provincial governments, focused on modernization of the former communist East. People who were brought up in a socialist culture became integrated with those living in capitalist western Germany.\n*[[Margaret Thatcher]], who had been the United Kingdom's Prime Minister since 1979, resigned as Prime Minister on 22 November 1990 after being challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by [[Michael Heseltine]]. This was because of widespread opposition to the introduction of the controversial [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], and the fact that her key allies such as [[Nigel Lawson]] and [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigned over the deeply sensitive issues of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and Margaret Thatcher's resistance to Britain joining the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Less than two years later on the infamous [[Black Wednesday]] of September 1992, the [[pound sterling]] crashed out of the system after the pound fell below the agreed exchange rate with the [[Deutsche Mark]].\n*[[John Major]] replaces [[Margaret Thatcher]] as Prime Minister in 1990.\n*The [[Perestroika|restructuring]] of the Soviet Union destabilizes, as nationalist and separatist demagogues gain popularity. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then [[Chairmen of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets|chairman]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] of [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], resigns from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and becomes the opposition leader against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The Communist Party loses its status as the governing force of the country and is banned after a [[August Putsch|coup attempt]] by Communist hardliners attempted to revert the effects of Gorbachev's policies. Yeltsin's counter-revolution is victorious on 25 December 1991 with the resignation of Gorbachev from presidency and the [[dissolution of the USSR]]. Yeltsin became president of the successor Russian Federation and presided over a period of political unrest, economic crisis, and social anarchy. On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin resigned leaving [[Vladimir Putin]] as acting president.\n*The [[European Union]] forms in 1992 under the [[Maastricht Treaty]].\n*The [[Downing Street Declaration]] 15 December 1993 by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[John Major]], and the [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland, [[Albert Reynolds]] at the British Prime Minister's office in [[10 Downing Street]]. It affirmed both the right of the people of Ireland to [[self-determination]], and that [[Northern Ireland]] would be transferred to the [[Republic of Ireland]] from the United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It included, as part of the prospective of the so-called \"Irish dimension\", the [[principle of consent]] that the people of the island of Ireland, had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.<ref>\nPeatling, Gary (2004).

The joint declaration also pledged the governments to seek a peaceful constitutional settlement, and promised that parties linked with paramilitaries (such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]) could take part in the talks, so long as they abandoned violence.<ref>Cox & Guelke, pp. 487\u2013488</ref>\n*The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] agreed to a truce in 1994. This marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the IRA and the United Kingdom, and the start of political negotiations.\n*[[Tony Blair]] becomes Prime Minister in 1997 following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]].\n*The [[Belfast Agreement]] (a.k.a. the Good Friday Agreement) is signed by U.K. and Irish politicians on 10 April 1998, declaring a joint commitment to a peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the United Kingdom over [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum]] was held on 22 May 1998. There was a large majority of 'Yes'. A total of 1,738 ballots were spoiled.

Four bullets hit Wallace.\n*15 July 1997 [[Gianni Versace]] was shot dead, aged 50, on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion as he returned from a morning walk on Ocean Drive. He was murdered by [[Andrew Cunanan]], who was also liable in murdering four others including [[Lee Miglin]], a real estate developer and Chicago tycoon two months prior, and used the same gun to commit suicide on a houseboat several days later.

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

The transformation from forest to farm is evident by the paler square shaped areas under development.]]\nAt the beginning of the decade, [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental protection]] became serious issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.\n\n==Society==\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\n[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and \"retro\" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in [[extreme sports]] and outdoor activities that combined embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.\n\nThose born in the 1990s are usually considered part of the [[Millennials|Millennial Generation]], along with those born in the late 1970s and 1980s. However, dates vary, with many demographers considering those born from 1995 onward as part of [[Generation Z]], the post-Millennial generation.<ref name=\"McCrindleAU\">[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf |date=16 June 2016 }}.

In the United States the [[Violence Against Women Act]] was passed, which greatly affected the world community through the United Nations. The law's author, [[Joe Biden]], and UN Ambassador and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton (see below) become vocal advocates of action against violence against women.\n*Women reach great heights of power in the United States government. [[Hillary Clinton]], leading policy proposals, traveling abroad as a State Department representative to 82 nations, advising her husband, and being elected a [[United States Senate|Senator]] (in 2000), is the most openly empowered and politically powerful [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in American history; [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Janet Reno]] take two of [[United States Cabinet|the cabinet]]'s top jobs as [[United States Secretary of State]] (#1), and [[United States Attorney General]] (#4), respectively.

Popular American contemporary R&B artists included [[Celine Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[En Vogue]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Dru Hill]] and [[Vanessa L. Williams]].\n\nThe [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]] brought 120,000 people together in the interest of increased human rights and autonomy for [[Tibet]] from China. [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.\n\n[[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s.

One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005\u2013present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\n''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000.

The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down.

The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\n\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance into the computer game world with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997, although they don't gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999. MMORPGs go on to become among the most popular genres in the first decade of the 21st century.\n\n''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' enters the world scene with the release of the original [[Game Boy]] ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Green]]'' games in Japan in 1996, later changed to ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Blue]]'' for worldwide release in 1998. It soon becomes popular in the United States, spurring the term Pok\u00e9mania and is adapted into a popular [[anime]] series and [[trading card]] game, among other media forms.\n\n''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' is released in 1996. It becomes the most popular survival-horror series in video gaming well into the next decade and inspires several films.\n\n''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' is released in September 1996, becoming an innovative platformer for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|Nintendo's '''[[Game Boy]]''' was a popular handheld game console during the 1990s.\nFile:PSX-Console-wController.png|The '''[[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]''' was released in the mid-1990s and became the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling gaming console]] of its time.\nFile:Diana Maria (cropped).jpg|The game '''''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]''''', launched in 1996, became particularly popular during the decade and as a result [[Lara Croft]]'s character eventually became a cultural icon in the video game industry\nFile:Mittelgrosse_lan-party.jpg|Private '''[[LAN parties]]''' were at the peak of their popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s when broadband Internet access was unavailable or too expensive for most people\n</gallery>\n\n=== Internet ===\n* '''Prominent websites / apps launched during the decade:''' [[IMDb]] (1993), [[EBay]] (1995), [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] (1994), [[GeoCities]] (1994), [[Netscape]] (1994), [[Yahoo!]] (1995), [[AltaVista]] (1995), [[ICQ]] (1996), [[Hotmail]] (1996), [[Google]] (1998), [[Napster]] (1999)\n* The pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing internet service '''[[Napster]]''', which was first launched in the fall of 1999, was the first peer-to-peer software to become massively popular. While at the time it was possible to share files in other ways via the Internet (such as [[IRC]] and [[USENET]]), Napster was the first software to focus exclusively on sharing MP3 files. Napster was eventually forced to shutdown in July 2001 to prevent further copyright violations.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Further|:Category:1990s architecture}}\n[[File:Twin Towers in all its Glory.JPG|thumb|right|120px|The [[Petronas Twin Towers]] were the world's tallest buildings when completed in 1999.]]\n*The [[Petronas Towers|Petronas Twin Towers]] became two of the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|tallest man-made structures]] ever built after they officially opened on 31 August 1999.\n\n===Sports===\n\n[[File:Blue Jays Win the 1993 World Series.jpg|250px|thumb|Fireworks in the [[SkyDome]] after [[Joe Carter]]'s [[1993 World Series|World Series]]-winning home run, as the Canadian [[Toronto Blue Jays]] won their second straight [[World Series]] title in 1993 against the US' [[Philadelphia Phillies]].]]\n*The [[1992 Summer Olympics]] are held in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].\n*[[Major League Baseball]] players went on [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] on 12 August 1994, thus ending the season and canceling the [[World Series]] for the first time in 90 years.

He revolutionized sports marketing through deals with companies such as [[Gatorade]], [[Hanes]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His Chicago Bulls team won six NBA titles during the decade ([[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]], [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]).

Upon his final game on 18 April, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six All-Star records. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, as well as the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season \u2013 a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive.
