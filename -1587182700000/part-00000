The decree was accepted at the Council of the Croatian Kingdom on November 3, 1671. The Academy was run by the [[Jesuits]] for more than a century until the order was dissolved by [[Pope Clement XIV]] in 1773. In 1776, Empress [[Maria Theresa]] issued a decree founding the ''Royal Academy of Science'' which succeeded the previous Jesuit Academy. Bishop [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] proposed the founding of a University to the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 1861. Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] signed the decree on the establishment of the University of Zagreb in 1869. The Act of Founding was passed by the Parliament in 1874, and was ratified by the Emperor on January 5, 1874. On October 19, 1874, the ''Royal University of Franz Joseph I'' was officially opened.\n\nThe University is composed of 29 faculties, 3 art academies and 1 university center with more than 70,000 students.

In 1919, this school became the Faculty of Husbandry and Forestry.\n\nIn 1919, the School of Technology (''Tehni\u010dka visoka \u0161kola'') was founded, which was transformed into a university faculty in 1926. Also in 1919 the School of Veterinary Medicine (''Veterinarska visoka \u0161kola'') was founded; it transformed into a university faculty in 1925.\n\n[[File:Great Hall of the Rectorate of the University of Zagreb.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Great Hall of the University]]\n\nIn the Faculty of Philosophy, major reorganization ensued in the 1920s, as mathematics, pharmacy and other sciences started to split off, first with the creation of separate mathematics and pharmaceutical departments in 1928, when the faculty was renamed into its current name ''Filozofski fakultet''.\n\nIn 1926, the university was composed of seven faculties:\n* Theology (''Bogoslovni fakultet'')\n* Law (''Pravni\u010dki fakultet'')\n* Medicine (''Lije\u010dni\u010dki fakultet'')\n* Philosophy (''Mudroslovni fakultet'')\n** Philosophy dept.

Organization in philosophy and it became a part of the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] Studies Department of the University of Zagreb.\n\nOn 8 December 2016, the Senate of the University of Zagreb determined that FFDI would become a faculty and equal component of the University under the title Faculty of Philosophy and Religious Sciences (FFRZ).<ref>{{Cite

The decree was accepted at the Council of the Croatian Kingdom on November 3, 1671. The Academy was run by the [[Jesuits]] for more than a century until the order was dissolved by [[Pope Clement XIV]] in 1773. In 1776, Empress [[Maria Theresa]] issued a decree founding the ''Royal Academy of Science'' which succeeded the previous Jesuit Academy. Bishop [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] proposed the founding of a University to the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 1861. Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] signed the decree on the establishment of the University of Zagreb in 1869. The Act of Founding was passed by the Parliament in 1874, and was ratified by the Emperor on January 5, 1874. On October 19, 1874, the ''Royal University of Franz Joseph I'' was officially opened.\n\nThe University is composed of 29 faculties, 3 art academies and 1 university center with more than 70,000 students.

Also in 1919 the School of Veterinary Medicine (''Veterinarska visoka \u0161kola'') was founded; it transformed into a university faculty in 1925.\n\n[[File:Great Hall of the Rectorate of the University of Zagreb.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Great Hall of the University]]\n\nIn the Faculty of Philosophy, major reorganization ensued in the 1920s, as mathematics, pharmacy and other sciences started to split off, first with the creation of separate mathematics and pharmaceutical departments in 1928, when the faculty was renamed into its current name ''Filozofski fakultet''.\n\nIn 1926, the university was composed of seven faculties:\n* Theology (''Bogoslovni fakultet'')\n* Law (''Pravni\u010dki fakultet'')\n* Medicine (''Lije\u010dni\u010dki fakultet'')\n* Philosophy (''Mudroslovni fakultet'')\n** Philosophy dept.

Taking a degree in architectural history from Cambridge University in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in London\u2019s Covent Garden that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the Greater London Council for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the Grenadier Guards, whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as Heal\u2019s, Liberty\u2019s and John Lewis. Venture capital was raised and significant investment made in a factory in Wiltshire which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Much was owed in this strategic shift to Ray Leigh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GRDM-Newsletter-22.pdf|title=22nd e-newsletter of the Gordon Russell Design Museum|website=www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, appointed chairman of the limited company in 1990, and an architect whose own background included work on the Festival of Britain in 1951 and a long career, first as design director then managing director, of iconic Cotswold furniture manufacturer Gordon Russell<ref>{{Cite book | last=Leigh | first=Ray | title=Advance the Product |date=2015 |publisher=Gordon Russell Trust|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Myerson | first=Jeremy | title=Gordon Russell, Designer of Furniture |date=1992 |publisher=The Design Council of Great Britain|}}</ref>. Here is the substantive link to the Arts and Crafts movement<ref>{{Cite book | last=Blakesley | first=Rosalind P. | title=The Arts & Crafts Movement |date=2006 |publisher=Phaidon|}}</ref> which is so important in the underlying philosophy of Luke Hughes and Company.\n\nIn 1990, the same year of Ray Leigh\u2019s appointment and the opening of the Wiltshire factory, the company opened a showroom / studio in Drury Lane, Covent Garden, establishing its distinctive identity at a level to reassure corporate clients. The first Oxbridge commission, of dining hall furniture for Corpus Christi College Cambridge, came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. The first commission for the Foreign Office \u2013 the British Embassy in Buenos Aires \u2013 and the first order over \u00a3250,000, for Merton College Oxford, followed in 1992. 1997 saw a high-profile commission at the height of the \u2018Cool Britannia\u2019 years for the idiosyncratic new British Embassy in Moscow, designed by Ahrends Burton Koralek<ref>{{Cite book | last=Melvin | first=Jeremy | title=British Embassy in Moscow |date=1999 |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Powell | first=Kenneth | title=From Russia with live - the Moscow embassy |date=2000 |publisher=Royal Academy Journal|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Taylor | first=David | title=ABK's Moscow Embassy - Britain at its best |date=2000 |publisher=Architect's Journal|}}</ref>, and in 1998 came the first order of over \u00a3500,000, for St Hugh\u2019s College Oxford. The late 90s also saw the development of meeting and conference room tables for the executive boardroom market<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Corbett |first=Sue |date=22 October 1998 |title=Table d'Art | magazine=Country Life}}</ref>, culminating in two widely publicised corporate HQs for Unilever and Diageo<ref>{{cite news |date=February 2003 |title=The spirit of enlightenment \u2013 Diageo headquarters | work=Architecture Today | edition=AT 135 }}</ref>.\n\nSince 2000 the company has concentrated on commissions for public buildings, a large proportion of them of either historic or architectural interest or both.\n\n==Company Philosophy & Identity==\nThe \u2018core proposition\u2019 of the Luke Hughes brand is \u2018Furniture in Architecture\u2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lukehughes.co.uk/project/overview-furniture-in-architecture|title=Company website's 'Furniture in Architecture' projects page|website=lukehughes.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>. Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the architecture is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the architect who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically.

Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as Heal\u2019s, Liberty\u2019s and John Lewis. Venture capital was raised and significant investment made in a factory in Wiltshire which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Much was owed in this strategic shift to Ray Leigh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GRDM-Newsletter-22.pdf|title=22nd e-newsletter of the Gordon Russell Design Museum|website=www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, appointed chairman of the limited company in 1990, and an architect whose own background included work on the Festival of Britain in 1951 and a long career, first as design director then managing director, of iconic Cotswold furniture manufacturer Gordon Russell<ref>{{Cite book | last=Leigh | first=Ray | title=Advance the Product |date=2015 |publisher=Gordon Russell Trust|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Myerson | first=Jeremy | title=Gordon Russell, Designer of Furniture |date=1992 |publisher=The Design Council of Great Britain|}}</ref>.

The first Oxbridge commission, of dining hall furniture for Corpus Christi College Cambridge, came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. The first commission for the Foreign Office \u2013 the British Embassy in Buenos Aires \u2013 and the first order over \u00a3250,000, for Merton College Oxford, followed in 1992. 1997 saw a high-profile commission at the height of the \u2018Cool Britannia\u2019 years for the idiosyncratic new British Embassy in Moscow, designed by Ahrends Burton Koralek<ref>{{Cite book | last=Melvin | first=Jeremy | title=British Embassy in Moscow |date=1999 |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Powell | first=Kenneth | title=From Russia with live - the Moscow embassy |date=2000 |publisher=Royal Academy Journal|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Taylor | first=David | title=ABK's Moscow Embassy - Britain at its best |date=2000 |publisher=Architect's Journal|}}</ref>, and in 1998 came the first order of over \u00a3500,000, for St Hugh\u2019s College Oxford.

Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the architecture is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the architect who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as New College Oxford<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

The proposition is that the longer a building and its furniture stay relevant, the longer the carbon stays locked up, and the longer it stays locked up, the less CO2 emissions. Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid hardwoods from suppliers who derive their raw material from forests managed to the standards of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification), SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan.

The Summa Corporation was the name adopted for the business interests of Howard Hughes after he sold the tool division of [[Hughes Tool Company]] in 1972. The company served as the principal holding company for Hughes' business ventures and investments. It is primarily involved in aerospace and defense, electronics, mass media, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, but has maintained a strong presence in a wide variety of industries including real estate, petroleum drilling and oilfield services, consulting, entertainment, and engineering. Much of his fortune was later used for philanthropic causes, notably towards health care and medical research.\n\n===Entertainment===\nHis first film, ''Swell Hogan,'' directed by [[Ralph Graves]], was a disaster. His next two films, ''[[Everybody's Acting]]'' (1926) and ''[[Two Arabian Knights]]'' (1927), were financial successes, the latter winning the first [[Academy Award for Best Director]] of a comedy picture.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|45\u201346}} ''[[The Racket (1928 film)|The Racket]]'' (1928) and ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1931) were also nominated for [[Academy Awards]].\n\nHughes spent $3.5&nbsp;million to make the flying film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930).<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|52,126}} ''Hell's Angels'' received one [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].\n\nHe produced another hit, ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), a production delayed by censors' concern over its violence.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|128}}\n\n''[[The Outlaw]]'' premiered in 1943, but was not released nationally until 1946. The film featured [[Jane Russell]], who received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to Russell's revealing costumes.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|152\u2013160}}\n\n====RKO====\n{{Main|RKO Pictures}}\n\n[[File:Howard-Hughes-TIME-1948.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hughes on the cover of [[TIME Magazine]], July 1948 (with the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] on the background)]]\n\nDuring the 1940s to the late 1950s, the Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film industry when it obtained partial ownership of the RKO companies which included RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, a chain of movie theaters known as RKO Theatres and a network of radio stations known as the RKO Radio Network.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes gained control of [[RKO]], a struggling major Hollywood studio, by acquiring the 929,000 shares owned by [[Floyd Odlum]]'s [[Atlas Corporation]], for $8,825,000. Within weeks of acquiring the studio, Hughes dismissed 700 employees. Production dwindled to 9 pictures that first year Hughes was in control, while before, RKO averaged 30 per year.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|234\u2013237}}\n\nProduction was shut down for six months during which time investigations were conducted of each employee who remained with RKO as far as their political leanings were concerned. Only after ensuring that the stars under contract to RKO had no suspect affiliations would Hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for re-shooting. This was especially true of the women who were under contract to RKO at that time. If Hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or if a film's [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] politics were not sufficiently clear, he pulled the plug. In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based group connected to the mafia with no experience in the industry disrupted studio operations at RKO even further.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1953, Hughes was involved with a high profile lawsuit as part of the settlement of the ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' [[Antitrust]] Case. As a result of the hearings, the shaky status of RKO became increasingly apparent. A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO's minority shareholders had grown to be extremely annoying to Hughes. They had accused him of financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement. Since Hughes wanted to focus primarily on his aircraft manufacturing and TWA holdings during the [[Korean War]] years, Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders in order to dispense with their distractions.\n\nBy the end of 1954, Hughes had gained near-total control of RKO at a cost of nearly $24&nbsp;million, becoming the first sole owner of a major Hollywood studio since the [[silent film era]]. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] for $25&nbsp;million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5&nbsp;million in personal profit.<ref>Lasky 1989, p. 229.</ref> According to Noah Dietrich, Hughes made a $10,000,000 profit from the sale of the theaters, and made a profit of $1,000,000 from his 7-year ownership of RKO.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|272\u2013273}}\n\nGeneral Tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the RKO library for television programming even though it made some attempts to continue producing films. After a year and a half of mixed success, General Tire shut down film production entirely at RKO at the end of January 1957. The studio lots in Hollywood and [[Culver City]] were sold to [[Desilu Productions]] later that year for $6.15&nbsp;million.\n\n===Real estate===\n{{main|Howard Hughes Corporation}}\n\nAccording to Noah Dietrich, \"Land became a principal asset for the Hughes empire.\" This investment sheltered the profits his companies made. Hughes acquired 1200 acres in Culver City for Hughes Aircraft, bought 7 sections [4,480 acres] in Tucson for his Falcon missile plant, and purchased 25,000 acres near Las Vegas.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|103,254}}\n\nBeyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful [[real estate]] investor. Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in [[Las Vegas]] and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime. In 1968, the [[Hughes Tool Company]] purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.\n\nOriginally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes Jr., was floated on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the Hughes Tool name. This forced the remaining businesses of the \"original\" Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa. The name \"Summa\"{{emdash}}Latin for \"highest\"{{emdash}}was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials). In 1988, Summa announced plans for [[Summerlin, Nevada|Summerlin]], a master-planned community named for the paternal grandmother of Howard Hughes, Jean Amelia Summerlin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nInitially staying in the [[Desert Inn]], Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels, and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million, and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the [[organized crime]] connected venues. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its [[Wild West]] roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} In addition to the Desert Inn, Hughes would eventually own the [[Las Vegas Sands|Sands]], [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Frontier]], [[Silver Slipper]], [[Castaways (casino)|Castaways]] and [[Landmark (hotel and casino)|Landmark]] and Harold's Club in Reno. Hughes would eventually become the largest employer in Nevada.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Aviation and aerospace===\n[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|Hughes with his [[Boeing 100]] in the 1940s]]\n\nAnother portion of Hughes' business interests lay in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot. He survived four airplane accidents: one in a [[Thomas-Morse Scout]] while filming ''Hell's Angels'', one while setting the air speed record in the Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near fatal crash of the [[Hughes XF-11]] in 1946. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including [[Moye Stephens]] and J.B. Alexander. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading [[Hughes Aircraft]] at the [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|airport in Glendale]], CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane [[Flight airspeed record|airspeed record]] of {{convert|352|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} over his test course near [[Santa Ana, California]] ([[Giuseppe Motta (aviator)|Giuseppe Motta]] reached 362&nbsp;mph in 1929 and [[George Stainforth]] reached 407.5&nbsp;mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new [[transcontinental airspeed record]] by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in seven hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of nine hours, 27 minutes). His average ground speed over the flight was {{convert|322|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Onkst, David H.

Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight. Taking off from [[New York City]], Hughes continued to [[Paris]], [[Moscow]], [[Omsk]], [[Yakutsk]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Minneapolis]], then returning to New York City. For this flight he flew a [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14 Super Electra]] (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a four-man crew) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment. Harry Connor was the co-pilot, Thomas Thurlow the navigator, Richard Stoddart the engineer, and Ed Lund the mechanic. Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of American aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible.

The D-2 design was abandoned, but led to the extremely controversial [[Hughes XF-11]]. The XF-11 was a large all-metal, two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]]-31 engines, each driving a set of [[contra-rotating propellers]].

It was built in Hughes' [[Westchester, California]], facility. In 1947, Howard Hughes was summoned to testify before the [[Senate War Investigating Committee]] to explain why the H-4 development had been so troubled, and why $22 million had produced only two prototypes of the XF-11. General Elliott Roosevelt and numerous other USAAF officers were also called to testify in hearings that transfixed the nation during August and November 1947. In hotly disputed testimony over [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]]'s route awards and malfeasance in the defense acquisition process, Hughes turned the tables on his main interlocutor, Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]], and the hearings were widely interpreted as a Hughes victory.

During and after World War II, Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor. The [[Hughes Helicopters]] division started in 1947 when [[helicopter]] manufacturer [[Kellett Autogiro Corporation|Kellett]] sold their latest design to Hughes for production. The company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor manufacturing numerous technology related products that include spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes created a new division of the company: the [[Hughes Aerospace#Hughes Aerospace Group|Hughes Aerospace]] Group. The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the [[Hughes Space and Communications Company#Hughes Space and Communications|Hughes Space and Communications Company]] in 1961. In 1953, Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax-exempt charitable organization. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion. In 1997, General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to [[Raytheon]] and in 2000, sold Hughes Space & Communications to Boeing. A combination of Boeing, GM, and [[Raytheon]] acquired the [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], where it focused on advanced developments in microelectronics, information & systems sciences, materials, sensors, and photonics; their workspace spans from basic research to product delivery. It has particularly emphasized capabilities in high performance integrated circuits, high power lasers, antennas, networking, and smart materials.\n\n====Airlines====\nIn 1939, at the urging of [[Jack Frye]], president of Transcontinental & Western Airlines, the predecessor of [[Trans World Airlines]] ([[TWA]]), Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of TWA stock, and took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944.<ref name=\":1\">Bartlett and Steele 2011, p. 216.</ref> Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, which included Noah Dietrich, and often issued orders directly to airline staff.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.stlmag.com/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/|title=TWA \u2013 Death Of A Legend|last=Grant|first=Elaine X.|date=July 28, 2006|work=St. Louis Magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Hughes Tool Co. purchased the first 6 [[Boeing C-75 Stratoliner|Stratoliners]] Boeing manufactured.

Convair proposed two concepts to Hughes, but Hughes was unable to decide which concept to adopt, and Convair eventually abandoned its initial jet project after the mockups of the 707 and [[Douglas DC-8]] were unveiled.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 218\u2013219.</ref> Even after competitors such as [[United Airlines]], [[American Airlines]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] had placed large orders for the 707, Hughes only placed eight orders for 707s through the Hughes Tool Company and forbade TWA from using the aircraft.<ref name=\":2\" /> After finally beginning to reserve 707 orders in 1956, Hughes embarked on a plan to build his own \"superior\" jet aircraft for TWA, applied for [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAB]] permission to sell Hughes aircraft to TWA, and began negotiations with the state of Florida to build a manufacturing plant there. However, he abandoned this plan around 1958, and in the interim, negotiated new contracts for 707 and [[Convair 880]] aircraft and engines totaling $400 million.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 219\u2013222.</ref>\n\nThe financing of TWA's jet orders precipitated the end of Hughes' relationship with [[Noah Dietrich]], and ultimately Hughes's ouster from control of TWA. Hughes did not have enough cash on hand or future cash flow to pay for the orders, and did not immediately seek bank financing. Hughes's refusal to heed Dietrich's financing advice led to a major rift between the two by the end of 1956. Hughes believed that Dietrich wished to have Hughes committed as mentally incompetent, although the evidence of this is inconclusive. Dietrich resigned by telephone in May 1957 after repeated requests for stock options, which Hughes refused to grant, and with no further progress on the jet financing.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, p. 224-228.</ref> As Hughes's mental state worsened, he ordered various tactics to delay payments to Boeing and Convair; his behavior led TWA's banks to insist that he be removed from management as a condition for further financing.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out of management of TWA, although he continued to own 78% of the company. In 1961, TWA filed suit against Hughes Tool Company, claiming that the latter had violated antitrust law by using TWA as a captive market for aircraft trading. The claim was largely dependent upon obtaining testimony from Hughes himself. Hughes went into hiding and refused to testify. A default judgment was issued against Hughes Tool Company for $135 million in 1963, but was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1973, on the basis that Hughes was immune from prosecution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/23/archives/just-about-everybody-versus-howard-hughes-the-strange-case-of-twa.html|title=The strange case of T.W.A. vs. Howard Hughes vs. T.W.A.|last=Brooks|first=John|date=December 23, 1973|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1966, Hughes was forced to sell his TWA shares.

According to Russell's autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to bed her after a party. Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again. The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years.

He stayed in the studio's darkened screening room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only [[chocolate]] bars and chicken and drank only [[milk]], and was surrounded by dozens of [[Kleenex]] boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions neither to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had neither bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to [[allodynia]], which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.<ref name=PPM.Tennant/>\n\nAfter the screening room incident, Hughes moved into a [[bungalow]] at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain\u2014a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially those who do not receive adequate treatment.<ref name=PPM.Tennant/> In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11&nbsp;million at the hotel.\n\nHughes began purchasing restaurant chains and four-star hotels that had been founded within the state of [[Texas]]. This included, if for only a short period, many unknown franchises currently out of business. He placed ownership of the restaurants with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and all licenses were resold shortly after.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAnother time, he became obsessed with the 1968 film ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'', and had it run on a continuous loop in his home.

For example, Hughes once became fond of [[Baskin-Robbins]]' banana nut ice cream, so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him, only to discover that Baskin-Robbins had discontinued the flavor. They put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order, 350 gallons (1,300 L), and had it shipped from Los Angeles. A few days after the order arrived, Hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only French vanilla ice cream. The Desert Inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year.<ref>Brown and Broeske 1996, p. 341.</ref> In a 1996 interview, ex\u2013Howard Hughes Chief of Nevada Operations [[Robert Maheu]] said, \"There is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. Hughes was concerned about the risk from residual [[Ionizing radiation|nuclear radiation]], and attempted to halt the tests.

Hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars, but she declined it. Hughes did not insist on a [[gag order|confidentiality agreement]] from Peters as a condition of the divorce.

It was apparently in a home surrounding the Desert Inn Golf Course belonging to the mother of an assistant.

The Summa Corporation was the name adopted for the business interests of Howard Hughes after he sold the tool division of [[Hughes Tool Company]] in 1972. The company served as the principal holding company for Hughes' business ventures and investments. It is primarily involved in aerospace and defense, electronics, mass media, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, but has maintained a strong presence in a wide variety of industries including real estate, petroleum drilling and oilfield services, consulting, entertainment, and engineering. Much of his fortune was later used for philanthropic causes, notably towards health care and medical research.\n\n===Entertainment===\nHis first film, ''Swell Hogan,'' directed by [[Ralph Graves]], was a disaster. His next two films, ''[[Everybody's Acting]]'' (1926) and ''[[Two Arabian Knights]]'' (1927), were financial successes, the latter winning the first [[Academy Award for Best Director]] of a comedy picture.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|45\u201346}} ''[[The Racket (1928 film)|The Racket]]'' (1928) and ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1931) were also nominated for [[Academy Awards]].\n\nHughes spent $3.5&nbsp;million to make the flying film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930).<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|52,126}} ''Hell's Angels'' received one [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].\n\nHe produced another hit, ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), a production delayed by censors' concern over its violence.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|128}}\n\n''[[The Outlaw]]'' premiered in 1943, but was not released nationally until 1946. The film featured [[Jane Russell]], who received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to Russell's revealing costumes.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|152\u2013160}}\n\n====RKO====\n{{Main|RKO Pictures}}\n\n[[File:Howard-Hughes-TIME-1948.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hughes on the cover of [[TIME Magazine]], July 1948 (with the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]] on the background)]]\n\nDuring the 1940s to the late 1950s, the Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film industry when it obtained partial ownership of the RKO companies which included RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, a chain of movie theaters known as RKO Theatres and a network of radio stations known as the RKO Radio Network.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes gained control of [[RKO]], a struggling major Hollywood studio, by acquiring the 929,000 shares owned by [[Floyd Odlum]]'s [[Atlas Corporation]], for $8,825,000. Within weeks of acquiring the studio, Hughes dismissed 700 employees. Production dwindled to 9 pictures that first year Hughes was in control, while before, RKO averaged 30 per year.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|234\u2013237}}\n\nProduction was shut down for six months during which time investigations were conducted of each employee who remained with RKO as far as their political leanings were concerned. Only after ensuring that the stars under contract to RKO had no suspect affiliations would Hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for re-shooting. This was especially true of the women who were under contract to RKO at that time. If Hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or if a film's [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] politics were not sufficiently clear, he pulled the plug. In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based group connected to the mafia with no experience in the industry disrupted studio operations at RKO even further.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1953, Hughes was involved with a high profile lawsuit as part of the settlement of the ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' [[Antitrust]] Case. As a result of the hearings, the shaky status of RKO became increasingly apparent. A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO's minority shareholders had grown to be extremely annoying to Hughes. They had accused him of financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement. Since Hughes wanted to focus primarily on his aircraft manufacturing and TWA holdings during the [[Korean War]] years, Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders in order to dispense with their distractions.\n\nBy the end of 1954, Hughes had gained near-total control of RKO at a cost of nearly $24&nbsp;million, becoming the first sole owner of a major Hollywood studio since the [[silent film era]]. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] for $25&nbsp;million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5&nbsp;million in personal profit.<ref>Lasky 1989, p. 229.</ref> According to Noah Dietrich, Hughes made a $10,000,000 profit from the sale of the theaters, and made a profit of $1,000,000 from his 7-year ownership of RKO.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|272\u2013273}}\n\nGeneral Tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the RKO library for television programming even though it made some attempts to continue producing films. After a year and a half of mixed success, General Tire shut down film production entirely at RKO at the end of January 1957. The studio lots in Hollywood and [[Culver City]] were sold to [[Desilu Productions]] later that year for $6.15&nbsp;million.\n\n===Real estate===\n{{main|Howard Hughes Corporation}}\n\nAccording to Noah Dietrich, \"Land became a principal asset for the Hughes empire.\" This investment sheltered the profits his companies made. Hughes acquired 1200 acres in Culver City for Hughes Aircraft, bought 7 sections [4,480 acres] in Tucson for his Falcon missile plant, and purchased 25,000 acres near Las Vegas.<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|103,254}}\n\nBeyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful [[real estate]] investor. Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in [[Las Vegas]] and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime. In 1968, the [[Hughes Tool Company]] purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.\n\nOriginally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes Jr., was floated on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the Hughes Tool name. This forced the remaining businesses of the \"original\" Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa. The name \"Summa\"{{emdash}}Latin for \"highest\"{{emdash}}was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials). In 1988, Summa announced plans for [[Summerlin, Nevada|Summerlin]], a master-planned community named for the paternal grandmother of Howard Hughes, Jean Amelia Summerlin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nInitially staying in the [[Desert Inn]], Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels, and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million, and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the [[organized crime]] connected venues. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its [[Wild West]] roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} In addition to the Desert Inn, Hughes would eventually own the [[Las Vegas Sands|Sands]], [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Frontier]], [[Silver Slipper]], [[Castaways (casino)|Castaways]] and [[Landmark (hotel and casino)|Landmark]] and Harold's Club in Reno. Hughes would eventually become the largest employer in Nevada.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Aviation and aerospace===\n[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|Hughes with his [[Boeing 100]] in the 1940s]]\n\nAnother portion of Hughes' business interests lay in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot. He survived four airplane accidents: one in a [[Thomas-Morse Scout]] while filming ''Hell's Angels'', one while setting the air speed record in the Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near fatal crash of the [[Hughes XF-11]] in 1946. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including [[Moye Stephens]] and J.B. Alexander. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading [[Hughes Aircraft]] at the [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|airport in Glendale]], CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane [[Flight airspeed record|airspeed record]] of {{convert|352|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} over his test course near [[Santa Ana, California]] ([[Giuseppe Motta (aviator)|Giuseppe Motta]] reached 362&nbsp;mph in 1929 and [[George Stainforth]] reached 407.5&nbsp;mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new [[transcontinental airspeed record]] by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in seven hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of nine hours, 27 minutes). His average ground speed over the flight was {{convert|322|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Onkst, David H.

Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight. Taking off from [[New York City]], Hughes continued to [[Paris]], [[Moscow]], [[Omsk]], [[Yakutsk]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Minneapolis]], then returning to New York City. For this flight he flew a [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14 Super Electra]] (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a four-man crew) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment. Harry Connor was the co-pilot, Thomas Thurlow the navigator, Richard Stoddart the engineer, and Ed Lund the mechanic. Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of American aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible.

The D-2 design was abandoned, but led to the extremely controversial [[Hughes XF-11]].

It was built in Hughes' [[Westchester, California]], facility. In 1947, Howard Hughes was summoned to testify before the [[Senate War Investigating Committee]] to explain why the H-4 development had been so troubled, and why $22 million had produced only two prototypes of the XF-11. General Elliott Roosevelt and numerous other USAAF officers were also called to testify in hearings that transfixed the nation during August and November 1947. In hotly disputed testimony over [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]]'s route awards and malfeasance in the defense acquisition process, Hughes turned the tables on his main interlocutor, Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]], and the hearings were widely interpreted as a Hughes victory. After being displayed at the harbor of Long Beach, California, the Hercules was moved to [[McMinnville, Oregon]], where it is now part of the [[Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum]].<ref>[http://www.evergreenmuseum.org/the-museum/aircraft-exhibits/the-spruce-goose/ \"Spruce Goose.\"] ''Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum''.

During and after World War II, Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor. The [[Hughes Helicopters]] division started in 1947 when [[helicopter]] manufacturer [[Kellett Autogiro Corporation|Kellett]] sold their latest design to Hughes for production. The company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor manufacturing numerous technology related products that include spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes created a new division of the company: the [[Hughes Aerospace#Hughes Aerospace Group|Hughes Aerospace]] Group. The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the [[Hughes Space and Communications Company#Hughes Space and Communications|Hughes Space and Communications Company]] in 1961. In 1953, Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax-exempt charitable organization. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion. In 1997, General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to [[Raytheon]] and in 2000, sold Hughes Space & Communications to Boeing. A combination of Boeing, GM, and [[Raytheon]] acquired the [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], where it focused on advanced developments in microelectronics, information & systems sciences, materials, sensors, and photonics; their workspace spans from basic research to product delivery. It has particularly emphasized capabilities in high performance integrated circuits, high power lasers, antennas, networking, and smart materials.\n\n====Airlines====\nIn 1939, at the urging of [[Jack Frye]], president of Transcontinental & Western Airlines, the predecessor of [[Trans World Airlines]] ([[TWA]]), Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of TWA stock, and took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944.<ref name=\":1\">Bartlett and Steele 2011, p. 216.</ref> Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, which included Noah Dietrich, and often issued orders directly to airline staff.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.stlmag.com/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/|title=TWA \u2013 Death Of A Legend|last=Grant|first=Elaine X.|date=July 28, 2006|work=St. Louis Magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Hughes Tool Co. purchased the first 6 [[Boeing C-75 Stratoliner|Stratoliners]] Boeing manufactured.

The Constellations were among the highest-performing commercial aircraft of the late 1940s and 1950s, and allowed TWA to pioneer nonstop transcontinental service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://airwaysmag.com/best-of-airways/howard-hughes-twas-constellations/|title=Howard Hughes and TWA\u00b4S Constellations \u2013 Airways Magazine|date=June 6, 2016|work=Airways Magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> During World War II, Hughes leveraged political connections in Washington to obtain rights for TWA to serve Europe, making it the only U.S. carrier with a combination of domestic and transatlantic routes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter the [[Boeing 707]] was announced, Hughes opted to pursue a more unique jet aircraft for TWA and approached [[Convair]] in late 1954. Convair proposed two concepts to Hughes, but Hughes was unable to decide which concept to adopt, and Convair eventually abandoned its initial jet project after the mockups of the 707 and [[Douglas DC-8]] were unveiled.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 218\u2013219.</ref> Even after competitors such as [[United Airlines]], [[American Airlines]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] had placed large orders for the 707, Hughes only placed eight orders for 707s through the Hughes Tool Company and forbade TWA from using the aircraft.<ref name=\":2\" /> After finally beginning to reserve 707 orders in 1956, Hughes embarked on a plan to build his own \"superior\" jet aircraft for TWA, applied for [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAB]] permission to sell Hughes aircraft to TWA, and began negotiations with the state of Florida to build a manufacturing plant there. However, he abandoned this plan around 1958, and in the interim, negotiated new contracts for 707 and [[Convair 880]] aircraft and engines totaling $400 million.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 219\u2013222.</ref>\n\nThe financing of TWA's jet orders precipitated the end of Hughes' relationship with [[Noah Dietrich]], and ultimately Hughes's ouster from control of TWA. Hughes did not have enough cash on hand or future cash flow to pay for the orders, and did not immediately seek bank financing. Hughes's refusal to heed Dietrich's financing advice led to a major rift between the two by the end of 1956. Hughes believed that Dietrich wished to have Hughes committed as mentally incompetent, although the evidence of this is inconclusive. Dietrich resigned by telephone in May 1957 after repeated requests for stock options, which Hughes refused to grant, and with no further progress on the jet financing.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, p. 224-228.</ref> As Hughes's mental state worsened, he ordered various tactics to delay payments to Boeing and Convair; his behavior led TWA's banks to insist that he be removed from management as a condition for further financing.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out of management of TWA, although he continued to own 78% of the company. In 1961, TWA filed suit against Hughes Tool Company, claiming that the latter had violated antitrust law by using TWA as a captive market for aircraft trading. The claim was largely dependent upon obtaining testimony from Hughes himself. Hughes went into hiding and refused to testify. A default judgment was issued against Hughes Tool Company for $135 million in 1963, but was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1973, on the basis that Hughes was immune from prosecution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/23/archives/just-about-everybody-versus-howard-hughes-the-strange-case-of-twa.html|title=The strange case of T.W.A. vs. Howard Hughes vs. T.W.A.|last=Brooks|first=John|date=December 23, 1973|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1966, Hughes was forced to sell his TWA shares.

For breakfast, Hughes wanted his eggs cooked the way his family cook, Lily, made them. Hughes had a \"phobia about germs\", and \"his passion for secrecy became a mania.\"<ref name=Noah/>{{rp|58\u201362,182\u2013183}}\n\nWhile directing ''The Outlaw'', Hughes became fixated on a small flaw in one of [[Jane Russell]]'s blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. [[Richard Fleischer]], who directed ''[[His Kind of Woman]]'' with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon. In his book, ''Just Tell Me When to Cry'', Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable [[mood swing]]s made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.\n\nIn 1958, Hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened screening room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only [[chocolate]] bars and chicken and drank only [[milk]], and was surrounded by dozens of [[Kleenex]] boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions neither to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had neither bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to [[allodynia]], which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.<ref name=PPM.Tennant/>\n\nAfter the screening room incident, Hughes moved into a [[bungalow]] at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain\u2014a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially those who do not receive adequate treatment.<ref name=PPM.Tennant/> In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11&nbsp;million at the hotel.\n\nHughes began purchasing restaurant chains and four-star hotels that had been founded within the state of [[Texas]]. This included, if for only a short period, many unknown franchises currently out of business. He placed ownership of the restaurants with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and all licenses were resold shortly after.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAnother time, he became obsessed with the 1968 film ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'', and had it run on a continuous loop in his home.

They put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order, 350 gallons (1,300 L), and had it shipped from Los Angeles. A few days after the order arrived, Hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only French vanilla ice cream.

The so-called \"Mormon Will\" gave $1.56 billion to various charitable organizations (including $625&nbsp;million to the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]), nearly $470&nbsp;million to the upper management in Hughes' companies and to his aides, $156&nbsp;million to first cousin William Lummis, and $156&nbsp;million split equally between his two ex-wives Ella Rice and [[Jean Peters]].\n\nIn this{{which?|date=April 2020}} will, Hughes left his entire estate to the Hughes Medical Institute, as he had no connection to family and was seriously ill. This is contrary to the many wills that have surfaced after his death. The original will that included payments to aides never surfaced. It was apparently in a home surrounding the Desert Inn Golf Course belonging to the mother of an assistant. He had no desire to leave any money to family, aides or churches, including William Gay and Frank Morse. Hughes was not Mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church. Frank P. Morse is still the attorney of record for Hughes.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nA further $156&nbsp;million was endowed to a gas-station owner, [[Melvin Dummar]], who told reporters that in 1967, he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along [[U.S. Route 95]], just {{convert|150|mi|km}} north of [[Las Vegas]]. The man asked for a ride to Vegas. Dropping him off at the [[Sands Hotel]], Dummar said the man told him that he was Hughes. Dummar later claimed that days after Hughes' death a \"mysterious man\" appeared at his gas station, leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk. Unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do, Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office. In 1978, a [[Nevada]] court ruled the Mormon Will a forgery, and officially declared that Hughes had died [[intestate]] (without a valid will). Dummar's story was later adapted into [[Jonathan Demme]]'s film ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'' in 1980.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/obituaries/melvin-dummar-dead.html|title=Melvin Dummar, 74, Who Claimed Howard Hughes Left Him Millions, Dies|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|date=2018-12-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nHughes' $2.5&nbsp;billion estate was eventually split in 1983 among 22 cousins, including William Lummis, who serves as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
