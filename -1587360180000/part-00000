The defence of Pistorius was that, in shooting at what he believed to be an intruder, he mistakenly believed he was acting in self-defence, and as self-defence excludes the unlawfulness requirement of criminal liability, an act in valid self-defence is lawful. Technically his defence amounted to a claim that he did not intend to act unlawfully. If he could raise a reasonable doubt in his favour that he was mistaken, as he claimed, he is entitled, under South African law, to an acquittal on the charge of murder. The court then considered whether this mistake was reasonable \u2013 one that a reasonable person, in his circumstances, may have made. If the court concluded that this was an unreasonable mistake, it would convict him of [[Culpable homicide]] (all other requirements assumed). [[Culpable homicide#South Africa|Culpable homicide in South African criminal law]] is defined as the negligent unlawful killing of another human being \u2013 roughly the equivalent of the English and US [[manslaughter]].<ref name=\"Grant\" />\n\n=== Progress of the trial ===\nOn the first and second day of the trial, a witness testified to hearing sounds of arguing that lasted about an hour.

The defence of Pistorius was that, in shooting at what he believed to be an intruder, he mistakenly believed he was acting in self-defence, and as self-defence excludes the unlawfulness requirement of criminal liability, an act in valid self-defence is lawful. Technically his defence amounted to a claim that he did not intend to act unlawfully. If he could raise a reasonable doubt in his favour that he was mistaken, as he claimed, he is entitled, under South African law, to an acquittal on the charge of murder. The court then considered whether this mistake was reasonable \u2013 one that a reasonable person, in his circumstances, may have made. If the court concluded that this was an unreasonable mistake, it would convict him of [[Culpable homicide]] (all other requirements assumed). [[Culpable homicide#South Africa|Culpable homicide in South African criminal law]] is defined as the negligent unlawful killing of another human being \u2013 roughly the equivalent of the English and US [[manslaughter]].<ref name=\"Grant\" />\n\n=== Progress of the trial ===\nOn the first and second day of the trial, a witness testified to hearing sounds of arguing that lasted about an hour.
