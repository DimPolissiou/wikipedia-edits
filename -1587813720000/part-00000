For such purposes, Hindustani was equated with Urdu, as opposed to any geographically defined dialect of Hindi and was given official status through large parts of north India. Written in the Persian script with a largely Persian and, via Persian, an Arabic vocabulary, Urdu stood at the shortest distance from the previous situation and was easily attainable by the same personnel. In the wake of this official transformation, the British government began to make its first significant efforts on behalf of vernacular education. The earliest controversies over Hindi versus Urdu apparently took place among the British because some officials were anxious to uproot the Mughal gentry by replacing Urdu with a still unformulated standard of Hindi.\"</ref>  Under the [[British Raj]], 1858\u20131947, Hindustani, as Urdu, remained, along with English, an official language of the British Indian Empire.<ref name=\"Dalby1998\">{{citation|last=Dalby|first=Andrew|title=Dictionary of Languages: The Definitive Reference to More Than 400 Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKSeVLghcfQC&pg=PA248|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11568-1|pages=248\u2013|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=}} Quote: \"Under the British Raj Persian eventually declined, but, the administration remaining largely Muslim, the role of Persian was taken not by Hindi but by Urdu, known to the British as Hindustani.\"</ref> The attempts at standardization, which had the unintended effect of exacerbating sectarian divisions characterized by diverse goals of linguistic purity, prompted [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in the 20th-century to promote a colloquial version of Hindustani.<ref name=britannica_gandhi_colloquial>{{citation|title=Hindustani language|author=Editors|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=8 December 2019|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hindustani-language}} Quote: \"Mahatma Gandhi realized that the standardization process was dangerously divisive.

The Arabic (and also Turkic) lexemes borrowed into Hindi frequently were mediated through Persian, as a result of which a throrough intertwining of Persian and Arabic elements took place, as manifest by such phenomena as hybrid compounds and compound words. Moreover, although the dominant trajectory of lexical borrowing was from Arabic into Persian, and thence into Hindi/Urdu, examples can be found of words that in origin are actually Persian loanwords into both Arabic and Hindi/Urdu.}}</ref> The grammar and base vocabulary (most pronouns, verbs, adpositions, etc.) of both Hindi and Urdu, however, are the same and derive from a Prakritic base, and both have Persian/Arabic influence.<ref name=\"PeterDass2019\"/>\n\nThe standardised registers Hindi and Urdu are collectively known as ''Hindi-Urdu''.<ref name=\"NCSU-Hindustani\"/> Hindustani is perhaps the ''lingua franca'' of the north and west of the [[Indian subcontinent]], though it is understood fairly well in other regions also, especially in the urban areas.<ref name=\"siddiqi1994\"/> A common vernacular sharing characteristics with Sanskritised Hindi, regional Hindi and Urdu, Hindustani is more commonly used as a vernacular than highly Sanskritised Hindi or highly Persianised Urdu.<ref name=\"Ashmore1961\"/>\n\nThis can be seen in the popular culture of [[Bollywood]] or, more generally, the vernacular of North Indians and Pakistanis, which generally employs a lexicon common to both ''Hindi'' and ''Urdu'' speakers.<ref name=\"Hiro2015\"/> Minor subtleties in region will also affect the 'brand' of Hindustani, sometimes pushing the Hindustani closer to Urdu or to Hindi. One might reasonably assume that the Hindustani spoken in [[Lucknow]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] (known for its usage of Urdu) and [[Varanasi]] (a holy city for Hindus and thus using highly Sanskritised Hindi) is somewhat different.<ref name=\"NCSU-Hindustani\"/>\n\n===Modern Standard Hindi===\n{{Main|Hindi}}\nStandard Hindi, one of the [[official languages of India|22 officially recognised languages of India]] and the [[official language]] of the Union, is usually written in the indigenous [[Devanagari]] script of India and exhibits less Persian and Arabic influence than Urdu. It has a literature of 500 years, with prose, poetry, religion and philosophy. One could conceive of a wide spectrum of dialects and registers, with the highly Persianised Urdu at one end of the spectrum and a heavily Sanskritized variety spoken in the region around [[Varanasi]], at the other end. In common usage in India, the term ''Hindi'' includes all these dialects except those at the Urdu spectrum. Thus, the different meanings of the word ''Hindi'' include, among others:\n# standardised Hindi as taught in schools throughout India (except some states such as Tamil Nadu),\n# formal or official Hindi advocated by [[Purushottam Das Tandon]] and as instituted by the post-independence Indian government, heavily influenced by Sanskrit,\n# the vernacular dialects of Hindustani as spoken throughout India,\n# the neutralised form of Hindustani used in popular television and films, or\n# the more formal neutralised form of Hindustani used in television and print news reports.\n\n===Modern Standard Urdu===\n[[File:Zaban urdu mualla.png|thumb|165px|The phrase ''Zab\u0101n-e Urdu-ye Mualla'' in the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script]]]]\n{{Main|Urdu}}\nUrdu is the [[national language]] and [[state language]] of Pakistan and one of the [[official languages of India|22 officially recognised languages of India]]. \nIt is written, except in some parts of India, in the Persian [[Nastaliq script]] using the [[Urdu alphabet]], an extended Perso-Arabic script incorporating Indic phonemes. It is heavily influenced by [[Dari Persian|Persian]] vocabulary and was historically also known as [[Rekhta]], the primary language of the Hindustani poetic tradition. \n\nAs [[Dakhini]] (or Deccani) where it also draws words from local languages, it survives and enjoys a rich history in the [[Deccan]] and other parts of [[South India]], with the prestige dialect being [[Hyderabadi Urdu]] spoken in and around the capital of the [[Nizams of Hyderabad|Nizams]] and the [[Deccan Sultanates]].\n\nEarliest forms of the language's literature may be traced back to the 13th-14th century works of [[Amir Khusrau|Am\u012br Khusrau Dehlav\u012b]], often called the \"father of [[Urdu literature]]\" while [[Wali Dakhni|Wal\u012b Deccani]] is seen as the progenitor of [[Urdu poetry]].\n\n===Bazaar Hindustani===\nIn a specific sense, ''Hindustani'' may be used to refer to the dialects and varieties used in common speech or slang, in contrast with the standardised Hindi and Urdu. This meaning is reflected in the use of the term ''[[bazaar]] Hindustani'', in other words, the \"street talk\" or literally \"marketplace Hindustani\", as opposed to the perceived refinement of formal Hindi/Urdu, or even Sanskrit.\n\n==Names==\n[[Amir Khusro]] ca. 1300 referred to this language of his writings as ''Dehlavi'' (\u0926\u0947\u0939\u0932\u0935\u0940; {{Nastaliq|\u062f\u06c1\u0644\u0648\u06cc}} 'of Delhi') or ''Hindavi'' (\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0935\u0940; {{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0646\u062f\u0648\u06cc}}).

Conversational registers of Hindi/Urdu (not to mentioned formal registers of Urdu) employ large numbers of Persian and Arabic loanwords, although in Sanskritized registers many of these words are replaced by ''tatsama'' forms from Sanskrit. The Persian and Arabic lexical elements in Hindi result from the effects of centuries of Islamic administrative rule over much of north India in the centuries before the establishment of British rule in India. Although it is conventional to differentiate among Persian and Arabic loan elements into Hindi/Urdu, in practice it is often difficult to separate these strands from one another. The Arabic (and also Turkic) lexemes borrowed into Hindi frequently were mediated through Persian, as a result of which a throrough intertwining of Persian and Arabic elements took place, as manifest by such phenomena as hybrid compounds and compound words. Moreover, although the dominant trajectory of lexical borrowing was from Arabic into Persian, and thence into Hindi/Urdu, examples can be found of words that in origin are actually Persian loanwords into both Arabic and Hindi/Urdu.}}</ref> The grammar and base vocabulary (most pronouns, verbs, adpositions, etc.) of both Hindi and Urdu, however, are the same and derive from a Prakritic base, and both have Persian/Arabic influence.<ref name=\"PeterDass2019\"/>\n\nThe standardised registers Hindi and Urdu are collectively known as ''Hindi-Urdu''.<ref name=\"NCSU-Hindustani\"/> Hindustani is perhaps the ''lingua franca'' of the north and west of the [[Indian subcontinent]], though it is understood fairly well in other regions also, especially in the urban areas.<ref name=\"siddiqi1994\"/> A common vernacular sharing characteristics with Sanskritised Hindi, regional Hindi and Urdu, Hindustani is more commonly used as a vernacular than highly Sanskritised Hindi or highly Persianised Urdu.<ref name=\"Ashmore1961\"/>\n\nThis can be seen in the popular culture of [[Bollywood]] or, more generally, the vernacular of North Indians and Pakistanis, which generally employs a lexicon common to both ''Hindi'' and ''Urdu'' speakers.<ref name=\"Hiro2015\"/> Minor subtleties in region will also affect the 'brand' of Hindustani, sometimes pushing the Hindustani closer to Urdu or to Hindi. One might reasonably assume that the Hindustani spoken in [[Lucknow]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] (known for its usage of Urdu) and [[Varanasi]] (a holy city for Hindus and thus using highly Sanskritised Hindi) is somewhat different.<ref name=\"NCSU-Hindustani\"/>\n\n===Modern Standard Hindi===\n{{Main|Hindi}}\nStandard Hindi, one of the [[official languages of India|22 officially recognised languages of India]] and the [[official language]] of the Union, is usually written in the indigenous [[Devanagari]] script of India and exhibits less Persian and Arabic influence than Urdu. It has a literature of 500 years, with prose, poetry, religion and philosophy. One could conceive of a wide spectrum of dialects and registers, with the highly Persianised Urdu at one end of the spectrum and a heavily Sanskritized variety spoken in the region around [[Varanasi]], at the other end. In common usage in India, the term ''Hindi'' includes all these dialects except those at the Urdu spectrum. Thus, the different meanings of the word ''Hindi'' include, among others:\n# standardised Hindi as taught in schools throughout India (except some states such as Tamil Nadu),\n# formal or official Hindi advocated by [[Purushottam Das Tandon]] and as instituted by the post-independence Indian government, heavily influenced by Sanskrit,\n# the vernacular dialects of Hindustani as spoken throughout India,\n# the neutralised form of Hindustani used in popular television and films, or\n# the more formal neutralised form of Hindustani used in television and print news reports.\n\n===Modern Standard Urdu===\n[[File:Zaban urdu mualla.png|thumb|165px|The phrase ''Zab\u0101n-e Urdu-ye Mualla'' in the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script]]]]\n{{Main|Urdu}}\nUrdu is the [[national language]] and [[state language]] of Pakistan and one of the [[official languages of India|22 officially recognised languages of India]]. \nIt is written, except in some parts of India, in the Persian [[Nastaliq script]] using the [[Urdu alphabet]], an extended Perso-Arabic script incorporating Indic phonemes. It is heavily influenced by [[Dari Persian|Persian]] vocabulary and was historically also known as [[Rekhta]], the primary language of the Hindustani poetic tradition. \n\nAs [[Dakhini]] (or Deccani) where it also draws words from local languages, it survives and enjoys a rich history in the [[Deccan]] and other parts of [[South India]], with the prestige dialect being [[Hyderabadi Urdu]] spoken in and around the capital of the [[Nizams of Hyderabad|Nizams]] and the [[Deccan Sultanates]].\n\nEarliest forms of the language's literature may be traced back to the 13th-14th century works of [[Amir Khusrau|Am\u012br Khusrau Dehlav\u012b]], often called the \"father of [[Urdu literature]]\" while [[Wali Dakhni|Wal\u012b Deccani]] is seen as the progenitor of [[Urdu poetry]].\n\n===Bazaar Hindustani===\nIn a specific sense, ''Hindustani'' may be used to refer to the dialects and varieties used in common speech or slang, in contrast with the standardised Hindi and Urdu. This meaning is reflected in the use of the term ''[[bazaar]] Hindustani'', in other words, the \"street talk\" or literally \"marketplace Hindustani\", as opposed to the perceived refinement of formal Hindi/Urdu, or even Sanskrit.\n\n==Names==\n[[Amir Khusro]] ca. 1300 referred to this language of his writings as ''Dehlavi'' (\u0926\u0947\u0939\u0932\u0935\u0940; {{Nastaliq|\u062f\u06c1\u0644\u0648\u06cc}} 'of Delhi') or ''Hindavi'' (\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0935\u0940; {{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0646\u062f\u0648\u06cc}}).

Most of the over 2,000 rivers and streams<ref name=\"Terry\">Terry</ref> have headwaters in the [[Andes]] mountain range, flowing therefrom either westward toward the [[Pacific Ocean]] or eastward toward the [[Amazon River]].<ref name=\"Hanratty\">Hanratty</ref> Narrow in the highlands, the majority of the rivers broaden as they reach the lower elevations of the [[Regions of Ecuador|Coast]] and Oriente.<ref name=\"Hanratty\"/> During the SUNNY season, which lasts from January to April, the rivers that drain into the Pacific flood and often cause damage.\n\n==Geography==\nThe two main water systems are the [[Esmeraldas River]] in the North and the [[Guayas River|Guayas]] in the South.<ref name=\"Gerlach\">Gerlach</ref>\n\nThe Esmeraldas begins as the [[Guayllabamba River]] in the Sierra, flowing west before emptying in the Pacific near the city of [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]].\n\nThe Guayas forms to the north of [[Guayaquil]], where the [[Daule River|Daule]] and the [[Babahoyo River]]s converge.  The Babahayo arises from its tributaries in the Andes.  The Guayas basin covers 40,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\"Hanratty\"/>\n\nThe most important rivers in the Oriente are the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]].  The Pastaza includes the [[Agoyan Waterfall]], Ecuador's highest.\n\n==Economy==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, the [[indigenous people of Ecuador]] used the rivers for fishing and transportation, although frequent waterfalls limited canoe travel in the Andes.  The rivers long continued to be an important means of transportation, especially as the mountains made road and railroad building difficult.\n\nSince the 20th century, rivers have become an important source of electric power in Ecuador.  As of 2006, hydroelectric dams have a capacity 1,750 megawatts.<ref name=\"Terry\">Terry</ref>  Some critics have noted that these projects have tended to be \"substantially oversized\" without \"delivering the promised energy benefits.\"<ref name=\"Terry\"/>  In 2008, [[President of Ecuador|President]] [[Rafael Correa]] announced that the [[government of Ecuador|government]] planned to build eleven new hydroelectric power plants.<ref name=\"Xinhua\">Xinhua</ref>  Almost all of the dam projects face opposition from local communities that fear negative environmental impacts on the land and a lack of transparency in decision-making.<ref name=\"Terry\"/>\n\nRecreational rafting on the rivers has become an important part of Ecuador's tourism-based economy.\n\n==Rivers==\nThis

Most of the over 2,000 rivers and streams<ref name=\"Terry\">Terry</ref> have headwaters in the [[Andes]] mountain range, flowing therefrom either westward toward the [[Pacific Ocean]] or eastward toward the [[Amazon River]].<ref name=\"Hanratty\">Hanratty</ref> Narrow in the highlands, the majority of the rivers broaden as they reach the lower elevations of the [[Regions of Ecuador|Coast]] and Oriente.<ref name=\"Hanratty\"/> During the SUNNY season, which lasts from January to April, the rivers that drain into the Pacific flood and often cause damage.\n\n==Geography==\nThe two main water systems are the [[Esmeraldas River]] in the North and the [[Guayas River|Guayas]] in the South.<ref name=\"Gerlach\">Gerlach</ref>\n\nThe Esmeraldas begins as the [[Guayllabamba River]] in the Sierra, flowing west before emptying in the Pacific near the city of [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]].\n\nThe Guayas forms to the north of [[Guayaquil]], where the [[Daule River|Daule]] and the [[Babahoyo River]]s converge.  The Babahayo arises from its tributaries in the Andes.  The Guayas basin covers 40,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\"Hanratty\"/>\n\nThe most important rivers in the Oriente are the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]].  The Pastaza includes the [[Agoyan Waterfall]], Ecuador's highest.\n\n==Economy==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, the [[indigenous people of Ecuador]] used the rivers for fishing and transportation, although frequent waterfalls limited canoe travel in the Andes.  The rivers long continued to be an important means of transportation, especially as the mountains made road and railroad building difficult.\n\nSince the 20th century, rivers have become an important source of electric power in Ecuador.  As of 2006, hydroelectric dams have a capacity 1,750 megawatts.<ref name=\"Terry\">Terry</ref>  Some critics have noted that these projects have tended to be \"substantially oversized\" without \"delivering the promised energy benefits.\"<ref name=\"Terry\"/>  In 2008, [[President of Ecuador|President]] [[Rafael Correa]] announced that the [[government of Ecuador|government]] planned to build eleven new hydroelectric power plants.<ref name=\"Xinhua\">Xinhua</ref>  Almost all of the dam projects face opposition from local communities that fear negative environmental impacts on the land and a lack of transparency in decision-making.<ref name=\"Terry\"/>\n\nRecreational rafting on the rivers has become an important part of Ecuador's tourism-based economy.\n\n==Rivers==\nThis

As of December 2009, there have been nine issues of ''Tango'', published intermittently since 1997, and an additional compilation ''The Tango Collection'', published in 2009 by [[Allen & Unwin]].\n\n==Overview==\n''Tango'' is described as \"the Australian romance comics anthology\".<ref name=\"cardigancomics.com\">http://www.cardigancomics.com/index.php/tango.html</ref>  Each issue features contributions by comic artists living and working in Melbourne and other parts of Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"anislandart.blogspot.com\">http://anislandart.blogspot.com/2009/06/tango9-love-and-war.html</ref>  The first three issues of ''Tango'' were large format publications, inspired by large format anthologies from the United States such as the early issues of [[RAW (magazine)|''RAW'']].<ref>http://www.cardigancomics.com/images/cardigan/downlods/romance-comics.pdf (p. 5)</ref>  Later issues became smaller in format, and beginning with the fourth issue in 2001 (''Tango Quatro''), each has been sub-titled with a theme of \"Love and ...\".  Respectively, the themes for issues four through nine have been: 'Love and Death', 'Love and the Senses', 'Love and Sex', 'Love and Sedition' 'Love and Food', and 'Love and War'.  Drawing on contributions from the first eight issues of ''Tango'', [[Allen and Unwin]] published ''The Tango Collection'' in 2009.<ref>http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an44241488</ref><ref>http://hackpacker.blogspot.com/2009/09/tango-collection-plus.html</ref>\n\n==The Creator of ''Tango''==\n[[Bernard Caleo]] is the creator and editor of ''Tango'', as well as being a contributor to each issue.  Caleo is also a performer, speaker, interviewer, blogger and general promoter of comics and comic talent in Melbourne and more broadly in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n==Origins==\nSpurred by the disappearance of an earlier Australian comic anthology, [[Fox Comics (Australia)|Fox Comics]], Caleo wanted to provide a vehicle for both experienced and new comic artists to demonstrate and develop their talents.<ref>http://www.cardigancomics.com/images/cardigan/downlods/romance-comics.pdf (p. 3)</ref>  The chosen theme of romance is intended to evoke associations with both love and adventure.<ref name=\"anislandart.blogspot.com\"/><ref>http://www.cardigancomics.com/images/cardigan/downlods/romance-comics.pdf (p. 4)</ref>\n\n==Issues==\nThere are currently nine issues of ''Tango'', with the latest issue ''Tango 9: Love and War'' published in December 2009.\n\n===Tango===\nPublished: 1997<br />\nEdited by: Bernard Caleo<br />\nCover: Anita Ba\u0109i\u0107<br />\npp.&nbsp;44\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As of December 2009, there have been nine issues of ''Tango'', published intermittently since 1997, and an additional compilation ''The Tango Collection'', published in 2009 by [[Allen & Unwin]].\n\n==Overview==\n''Tango'' is described as \"the Australian romance comics anthology\".<ref name=\"cardigancomics.com\">http://www.cardigancomics.com/index.php/tango.html</ref>  Each issue features contributions by comic artists living and working in Melbourne and other parts of Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"anislandart.blogspot.com\">http://anislandart.blogspot.com/2009/06/tango9-love-and-war.html</ref>  The first three issues of ''Tango'' were large format publications, inspired by large format anthologies from the United States such as the early issues of [[RAW (magazine)|''RAW'']].<ref>http://www.cardigancomics.com/images/cardigan/downlods/romance-comics.pdf (p. 5)</ref>  Later issues became smaller in format, and beginning with the fourth issue in 2001 (''Tango Quatro''), each has been sub-titled with a theme of \"Love and ...\".  Respectively, the themes for issues four through nine have been: 'Love and Death', 'Love and the Senses', 'Love and Sex', 'Love and Sedition' 'Love and Food', and 'Love and War'.  Drawing on contributions from the first eight issues of ''Tango'', [[Allen and Unwin]] published ''The Tango Collection'' in 2009.<ref>http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an44241488</ref><ref>http://hackpacker.blogspot.com/2009/09/tango-collection-plus.html</ref>\n\n==The Creator of ''Tango''==\n[[Bernard Caleo]] is the creator and editor of ''Tango'', as well as being a contributor to each issue.  Caleo is also a performer, speaker, interviewer, blogger and general promoter of comics and comic talent in Melbourne and more broadly in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n==Origins==\nSpurred by the disappearance of an earlier Australian comic anthology, [[Fox Comics (Australia)|Fox Comics]], Caleo wanted to provide a vehicle for both experienced and new comic artists to demonstrate and develop their talents.<ref>http://www.cardigancomics.com/images/cardigan/downlods/romance-comics.pdf (p. 3)</ref>  The chosen theme of romance is intended to evoke associations with both love and adventure.<ref name=\"anislandart.blogspot.com\"/><ref>http://www.cardigancomics.com/images/cardigan/downlods/romance-comics.pdf (p. 4)</ref>\n\n==Issues==\nThere are currently nine issues of ''Tango'', with the latest issue ''Tango 9: Love and War'' published in December 2009.\n\n===Tango===\nPublished: 1997<br />\nEdited by: Bernard Caleo<br />\nCover: Anita Ba\u0109i\u0107<br />\npp.&nbsp;44\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Michael H. Payne", "text_new": "{{other people|Michael Payne}}\n{{BLP sources|date=November 2013}}\n'''Michael H. Payne''' (born February 10, 1965) is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] writer, cartoonist, and reviewer. He holds an M.A. in [[Classics]] from the [[University of California, Irvine]], and has hosted the Darkling Eclectica, a radio program originally on Saturday mornings, now on Sunday afternoons, on [[KUCI]] for more than 30 years.\n\nPayne's novel ''The Blood Jaguar'' ([[Tor Books]], 1998) and most of his short stories utilize [[talking animals in fiction|talking animal]] characters: his novelette \"Crow's Curse\" won third place in the [[Writers of the Future]] contest in 1991 and his short story \"Familiars\" won the [[Ursa Major Award]] in 2002. His cartoons as well, published in the ''New Horizons'' anthology from [[Shanda Fantasy Arts]] and on his websites, take animals, give them intelligence, and examine what sorts of multi-cultural societies they might form.\n\nAs a reviewer, Payne is a past contributor to Tangent magazine, both in its original print edition and in its early online form, and his capsule book reviews began appearing in 1999 on the website of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] before being moved in August 2009 to the \"members only\" section of the site's discussion forum.

There have been different opinions about his nature of identity and it's been told by some of his devotees he is such or such person. But far from any pretension he has called all those attributes chimerical and superstitious and once answered to the question 'who you really are?': ''\"I am not somebody else, I am who I am.\"''<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/WhoIsTheMasterEn/2090/ Who is Master Iliya?], An Introduction published at Fattahi's official website.</ref>\nHe presents himself as a servant of God and frequently refers to himself as an ordinary and normal person.

The founder of Elahism is Maha-Avatar who has been called by various names and appellations in different regions of the globe. He is known as Master Rouhollah in Iran. A number of documentaries (in the form of films and books) have been produced about him. It's also been claimed that he has the highest rank in the esoteric masters' hierarchy. However, ''Elahism'' has been taught by some other spiritual masters in the world. The Esoteric Elahism could be defined as divine-shifted esoteric knowledge which is neither related to any of the religions nor faiths, sects or cults. Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques (named ZX methods) are the secret part of these teachings which is taught in the form of non \u2013public tutorials.</ref> A more popular name given to his teachings is \"The Art of [[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Life\" which is carried on two levels. The first level consists of simple and general instructions which is called the ''Solar Level'' or the stage of \"Revival and Rebirth\". This is the cycle of awakening, of the opening of eyes and ears, of mobilization of minds and activation of hearts.\n\nThe essence of his instructions in this level is a perception of [[divinity|divine]] presence and revelation of love for [[The Lord]] or \"living lovingly in the divine presence\". His teachings are based upon determining principles and clear basis.<ref>The Art of Transcendental Life is neither a new sacred law \u2013 [[shariat]] \u2013 nor a new spiritual path, but it is the interpretation and significance of the words of the Living Lord in the present time. The basis of his teachings consists of \"tendency towards the truth\" and this means to be inclined towards existence and presence instead of to lean towards the illusion. That is to say, being inclined toward God, God- worshiping, God-seeking, God-centeredness, God-infatuation, God-mindfulness, God-observance, God-infatuation instead of being inclined towards oneself, self-worshiping, selfishness, self-conceit, self-infatuation, and self-centeredness. In the art of transcendental life, the emphasis is on quality, introversion, and worship of the Lining One rather than extroversion and worship of dead.</ref>\n\nThe second level is called ''Astronomical Level'' or ''Transcendental Arts'' which is related to metaphysical techniques or Psychotechnology and consists of teachings of mysteries. This level is meant for the selected and admitted individuals and due to its mysterious nature, quite a little information has been publicized about its details.<ref>More information could be retrieved at [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Fattahi's autobiography], page 112</ref><br />\n \nElia does not charge the attendees for his teachings but he believes the student's self is the price of their training.<ref>same</ref>\n\n===Other branches of Elia's public teachings===\nIn addition to [[spirituality|spiritual]] and cognitive teachings, Fattahi has held some tutorials for a limited number of his students during which they have been trained in more specialized fields. Science of Success, Harmonical Marriage, Sublime Nutrition, Creative Speaking, Methods of Sublime Struggling, Methods of Writing, Lecturing and Doing research, [[wikt:symbolism|Symbolism]] and Nature-based [[Semiotics]], Methods of Dynamic and Coordinated Therapy, Techniques of Analyzing and Interpreting of the Articles, and Esoteric [[Anthropology]] are some of his semi-public teaching courses.<ref>same</ref>\n\n====Thinking Methods====\nOne of the most pivotal branches of Fattahi's teachings is called ''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Teach/Teach9/1710/ XZY]'' or ''36 Methods of Sublime Thinking''. Methods such as [http://prothinka.org/Article/2887/ Creative Thinking], [http://prothinka.org/Article/2886/ Pattern-extractor Thinking] as well as Conceptualizer Thinking, Foresighter, Symmetrizing and Ultra-viewing methods could be noted.

This can be concluded regarding his activities within the recent years which was mainly focused on the field of thinking and thought. Some of the El-Yasin affiliated institutions such as [http://www.pmrg.ir/portal Professional Management Research Group] (PMRG) as well as [[www.prothinka.com|Association of Thinkers and Researchers]] have also been very active in discussion and transcription of Fattahi's thinking methods ever since.\n\n===Non-public Teachings===\nAnother aspect of Fattahi's teaching is focused on [[esoteric]] knowledge. It's been called ''Astronomical level'', ''ZX methods'' or Psychotechnology in which Creative Dreaming (dream making), Spiritual Communication, Teletransportation, Energy Hunting and Parallel Experiencing are taught to the trainees.<br />\nFattahi believes such trainings are not necessary for the public, therefore, he has recommended them to a limited number of his followers who have been selected and admitted by precise and strict criteria. According to Fattahi's followers, it's necessary for an esoteric apprentice to be committed to some strict rules such as keeping anonymity, protecting the mysterious techniques, avoiding the use of their abilities for personal means and complying with some unusual conditions.<ref>More information could be retrieved from [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Aamin, vol.1], page 12</ref>\n\nRegardless to the detailed content of all above-mentioned categories, Fattahi considers the extract of his teachings in the divine phrase ''There is no deity other than Him/Her'' (La Elaha Ella Hou).<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, 1998</ref>\n\n==Lectures==\nThe first rounds of Master Elia's public lectures were begun at his age of 23 (1996) in [[Tehran]]. These lectures used to be held mostly in cultural centers and community halls and were extremely welcomed by different categories of audiences especially youth, [[students]], writers, [[intellectuals]] and [[scholars]]. \nBefore being forced to stop by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Iran)]], the organizers had to arrange his lectures in the largest [[auditoriums]] of Tehran with the capacity for admission of thousands of people, but, those auditoriums were not spacious enough for eager audiences, therefore, further sessions were carried out with [[wikt:audio|audio]] or video playback.\n\nThose lectures were generally given in various subjects such as:\n* [[Faith]], the key of human [[salvation]]\n* [[Thinking]] and its methods\n* [[wikt:divine|Divine]] [[Parables]]\n* Calling on God\n* God is the one\n* Review and analysis of Eastern mysticism\n* Guiles and traps of the [[Devil]]\n* Observation and methods of controlling [[ego (spirituality)|ego]]\n* God's holy names\n* [[Parapsychology]] and Science of success\n* The art of [[transcendentals|transcendental]] living; the sublime life\n* God's [[blessing]], God's [[Divine grace|grace]]\n* Gratitude to God\n* Divine communication\n* Methods of [[worshiping]] and the keys to materialization of a wish\n* [[The Art of Dreaming|Dreaming]] and creative observation\n* Female-dominance or male-dominance?\n* The Superior President\n* Your attitude is determinant to your [[future]]\n* Determinative words\n* ...\n\nIn the following years, under serious pressures of the Security Office against Religions and Religious Minorities, the lectures were held less frequently. Not a day passed without direct or indirect attacks from radical [[clergies]] in their bid to control the scene of culture and religion. \nIn Spring 2005, during a lecture at the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium]] in Tehran, a direct and physical attack was mounted by undercover agents in a bid to harm and arrest Elia.<ref>To watch a footage of this event click [http://ostad-iliya.org/MovieEn/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=114 here] or [http://ostad-iliya.org/Movie/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=103 here] .</ref> Although, he was not arrested as a result of participants' robust defense but this session is considered as the last public meeting of Master Elia M. Ramollah since 2005. It is worth mentioning that in winter 2007 a plan was set to hold a speech session in [[Azadi Stadium]] (Tehran) with a capacity to admit 100,000 audiences, but it was dropped due to strong disagreement of the authorities at [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Ministry of Intelligence and Security of Iran]].\n\n==From the critics' point of view==\nFattahi's name (Elia M. Ramollah) was first mentioned by [[Kayhan|''Kayhan'' newspaper]]<ref>Kayhan newspaper, 28/03/1383- Persian calendar</ref> (the organ of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]) as a perverted character (2004). His name was published once again in ''Kayhan''<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> and ''[[Resalat (newspaper)|Resalat]]''<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref> newspapers a few months before his first detention in 2007 by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Security service of Iran]].\n\nTaking the actions of Iranian governmental newspapers and TVs into account, one can conclude that despite having thousands of followers and admirers, Fattahi is faced with serious [[dogmatic]] [[critics]] some of which accuse him of heresy and claiming [[prophecy]], and categorize his teachings as a [[New religious movement]] (NRM).<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref>\n\nSome others, however, consider him as the master of a tempting and [[Subversion|subversive]] [[sect]], related to global [[Zionism]] networks, related to [[Freemasonry|Masons]], a talented [[Hypnotize Minds|mesmerizer]], [[wizard (paranormal)|wizard]], a neo-[[Rasputin]] and a [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] promoter.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhouri Eslami]] newspaper published an article titled ''A God who is the 13th child of his family'' in which Fattahi was introduced as a person claiming [[deity]].<ref>Jomhouri Eslami newspaper, No. 8619, 02/03/1388- persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn brief, various calumnious accusations surfaced against Fattahi were:\nThe new [[Messiah]], [[Krishnamurti]]'s next ring, the [[Devil]], spirit of Messiah, the prophet of non-believers and non-religious, the preacher of spirituality without religion, US and Western power's agent, a preacher of negative resistance, 21st century wizard, Mahatma Elia, the second [[Gandhi]], the second [[Martin Luther|Luther]], the 3rd [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], corrupted, excommunicated, leader of American culture, a preacher of spiritual innovation and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], harbinger of so-called Elia-ism, and a deity claimant.\n\nTo address the accusations claimed by Fattahi's opponents, the 6th branch of the Special Court for Governmental Staffs was authorized to open a special case against him (2006), and recalled the possible plaintiffs through a public announcement by [[Kayhan]] to lodge their complaints.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> However, the case was closed without any specific result due to lack of plaintiffs.<ref>[http://www.ettelaat.net/08-maj/news.asp?id=28905 Ettelaat Net]</ref>\n\nElia's opponents do not deny his ability and knowledge in different areas but unlike his fans who consider it as an entitlement of a divine sense, their approach is to destruct and to question his talents.\nSome of them claim that his charismatic character has its root on his childhood and the family issues he was facing combined with an essence of talent and innate genius: \n''Due to his family problems, especially mental turbulent atmosphere full of family conflicts, he was forced to quit school and became solitary and isolated.''<ref>Anonymous,''Elia, Ramollah, the Avatar and ...'', Kajraheh Supplement, Jam e Jam Newspaper, March 2007, p. 18</ref> <br />\n \nSome other opponents attribute his talents to extensive studies in various fields:\n''Later on, he began studying the metaphysics books and documents such as Psycho technology, halo vision, dreaming, Maha-meditation, energy healing and other so-called science including cosmic science. He then met some celebrities and masters in this area\u2026''<ref>same</ref>\n\n''Despite lack of formal education and classical studies, he took advantage of his talents and proportional abilities to compensate his personality defects very well.''<ref>same</ref>\n\nFattahi has responded to some of these allegations in this way:\n\n''Question: Some believe you are insane or a wizard. Why should they believe so?''\n\nAnswer: \"If I would use the opposite medicine you would use to cure the same illness, we shall, naturally, take each other for insane. It is not your fault to call me mad for you to realize the way I act, think or move is contrary to your expectations. Since you take yourself as a wise person, you will naturally call mad and insane whoever moves and thinks unlike you\u2026those who call me sorcerer and wizard want to relieve their conscience and actually assert themselves and maintain their claims.\nThey hear my teachings and get impressed and see that others are impressed as well. They observe changes and evolution, awakenings and cries and are thus faced with divine power and holy teachings. However, they think if they accept these teachings, the colossal palace they have built in their conceit will collapse and their false and superficial rightfulness will be denounced. They believe accepting the teachings of God's Spirit jeopardizes their profits\u2026They see the divine power yet because it goes against their egoistic aspirations they attack the person and individuality of the teacher. They calumniate him and investigate his personality.\"<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Page 123-124</ref>\n\nThere have been several statements officially published by Elyasin Community as a response to rumors and allegations about Peyman Fattahi.<ref>These statements have originally been issued between 1990 and 1997 by the Office of Public Relations of the community and republished to clarify his followers' attitude toward those rumors. To read an extract of them click [http://www.ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/ here].</ref>\n\nFattahi's devotees do believe most of these rumors and allegations have been already responded in officially issued statements, however, many of them have been actively challenging with such destructive acts specifically after the open conflicts of Iranian security service with their master and leader. They have expressed their disagreement with these demolition jobs mostly by compiling books, publishing articles, film making, and blogging and are still working on these issues.\n\nIn spite of their attempts to respond to the allegations and rumors, destructive acts by Fattahi's opponents are still ongoing, using the governmental tribunes and in form of publishing articles, circulation of free bulletins and digests, broadcasting TV serials and round-tables as well as making fake and fabricated documentaries. In Summer 2011, a report was published by Religions and Faiths Watch<ref>http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/308/1/ Corruptors and Demons!</ref> about the exhibition and fairs held by [[Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom|Qom Seminary]] and the [http://www.ido.ir/en/en-default.aspx Islamic Development Organization] (IDO). In those events, an extensive attack has been designated to happen against Green movement leaders ([[Mirhossein Mousavi|Mousavi]], [[Mehdi KARUBI|Karubi]] and [[Seyed Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]]), U.S. presidents ([[Barack Obama]] and [[George W. Bush]]), European presidents (like [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]), some Iranian intellectuals and dissidents (such as Dr [[Abdolkarim Soroush|Soroush]], [[Mohsen Kadivar]], [[Akbar Ganji]], [[Alireza Nourizadeh]], [[Mohsen Sazegara]]). In these sets of exhibitions, further to Peyman Fattahi (known as Master Elia \u2013 the leader of Elyasin Community) some spiritual movements (such as [[Baha'i]]s and [[Dervish]]es) and spiritual leaders (such as [[Dalai Lama]], [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], Paul Twitchel \u2013 the master of [[Eckankar]] and Li Hongzhi \u2013 the master of [[Falun Dafa]]) has been targeted by Iranian extremist clergies.\n\nFurthermore, a TV programme entitled ''[[Armageddon]]'' (the final battle between the good and evil) has been broadcast by the News Channel of Islamic republic of Iran (IRINN) and other governmental media (2011). The TV series consists of 104 episodes, some of which have been replayed several times by governmental TV. According to the latest report of ''Association of Thinkers and Researcher''<ref>''The 45th attack of Iranian extremist clergies to Master Elia'' (Summary of Armageddon TV Series, episode 25), Paris Keynezhad \u2013 Senior member of Association of THikers and Researchers</ref> episode 25 begins with blatant lies and demolition jobs on Elia M. then continues doing the same against the author [[Paulo Coelho]]. It is claimed in the film that Paulo Coelho is corrupted, Satanist, Zionist and a drug addict. In another episode the narrator speaks about other famous characters and groups like [[Shimon Peres]]-the ex-prime minister and the current president of Israel and one of the pioneers of modern Zionism, [[Osho Rajneesh]] and [[Eckankar]] spiritual movement then emphasizes that the [[U.S.]] presidents, like Mr. Bush and Obama as well as the foreign minister of United States [[Hillary Clinton]], European presidents and even the Pope<ref>the world leader of catholic Christians</ref> are all [[Satanist]]s.\n\nThe 4th season of ''Armageddon'' TV programme has been replayed four times on governmental television of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].<ref>The main subject of the other episodes of Armageddon, season 4 is as follows:\nMedia Pluralism, Satellite Channels, BBC, VOA ( in this episode it is claimed that VOA is affiliated with Zionism, Baha'i, etc), Cold Digital War (claiming that Facebook, Microsoft, Internet, etc. are all perverted and Zionistic), Rereading the History of Cinema in Iran (claiming that the cinema of Iran has its roots in Freemasons and Zionism\u2026), Zionist Cults and Terrorist Coup d'\u00e9tat-seekers (it speaks about the Baha'i's attempts to dominate Iran and their treachery and demolitions), Secular Sufis, Modern Spiritualities (claiming that Dalai Lama, Sai Baba, Osho, Krishnamurti, etc. are all perverted and hirelings and Ekankar, TSM, etc. are all Zionistic), Anarchistic Spirituality (claiming that Elia M.

A number of his close associates and followers were also arrested<ref>[[Khabarnet]], 13 July 2009</ref> including two of his brothers, Keyvan and Ramin Fattahi.\n\nIn 2004, Fattahi and his followers began to gain attention in the mainstream media, with an incendiary editorial in a hard-line national newspaper portraying Fattahi as a miscreant.<ref>[[Kayhan]], 17 June 2004</ref> Several more articles were published in hard-line newspapers since then (Resalat, Kayhan, Jam e jam, Jomhouri Eslami), with the charges leveled at Fattahi and his group taking on a more serious air. These reports and the growing magnitude of his public events may have ultimately contributed to his arrest.\n\n\"On May 27, 2007, Master Fattahi (known as Eliya M) was arrested by the \"Department against Religions and Religious Minorities\" (DARRM). He was sent to notorious security ward 209 of [[Evin prison]]. Afraid of his follower's support, the security officials were at loss to decide on jailing him. According to DARRM statement, Eliya M. was finally arrested by the decision of high-ranking religious officials. A council consist of highest-ranking religious and cleric powers of Iran decided that Eliya M. should be quietly arrested under charges of permuting the religion (Islam), proselytism, an invitation to spiritual pluralism, conspiracy against the Islamic government, renewal of religion by linking Islam, Christianity and Judaism; spiritual liberalism and incitement to the so \u0640 called American Islam and many other routine accusations that are used in these cases such as Offending sacred symbols of religion, a conspiracy by creating underground secret society and cult (Eliya \u0640 ism). But he had only one crime: he was against the Islam that calls for violence... Eliya was arrested for spiritual liberty, for a different interpretation of God's words which was against the cold stagnant understanding of religion.\".<ref>Extracted from [http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/40/36/ the first open letter of Elia's followers to leaders of the world]</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Peyman Fattahi was released on a bail of 300 million Tomans (almost 300,000 USD) after spending six months in prison, suffering from recurrent bleeding from nose and ears, bloody vomiting and bloody urination.<ref>[[U.S Department of State]] annual report on Iran Human Rights.

Elyasin consists of a number of NGO's and publishing houses, most of which have been banned and shut time from the time of Ahmadinejad's presidency.

However, it's been recognized that people from different categories of the society has joined him as his followers; [[literate]] and [[illiterate]], young and old, religious and secular, [[intellectual]] and [[dogmatic]], rich, poor, and even a few numbers of people with a very low incidence of being influenced by his teachings; those who have been addicted, [[perverted]] or had been considering themselves as extraordinary people and had some followers.\n\nFattahi's teachings are based on ''Elahism''.<ref>Elahism is a universal monotheistic ritual transcending any religion or faith (in [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages it could be an abbreviation of [[Allah]]-ism). The founder of Elahism is Maha-Avatar who has been called by various names and appellations in different regions of the globe. He is known as Master Rouhollah in Iran. A number of documentaries (in the form of films and books) have been produced about him. It's also been claimed that he has the highest rank in the esoteric masters' hierarchy. However, ''Elahism'' has been taught by some other spiritual masters in the world. The Esoteric Elahism could be defined as divine-shifted esoteric knowledge which is neither related to any of the religions nor faiths, sects or cults. Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques (named ZX methods) are the secret part of these teachings which is taught in the form of non \u2013public tutorials.</ref> A more popular name given to his teachings is \"The Art of [[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Life\" which is carried on two levels. The first level consists of simple and general instructions which is called the ''Solar Level'' or the stage of \"Revival and Rebirth\". This is the cycle of awakening, of the opening of eyes and ears, of mobilization of minds and activation of hearts.\n\nThe essence of his instructions in this level is a perception of [[divinity|divine]] presence and revelation of love for [[The Lord]] or \"living lovingly in the divine presence\". His teachings are based upon determining principles and clear basis.<ref>The Art of Transcendental Life is neither a new sacred law \u2013 [[shariat]] \u2013 nor a new spiritual path, but it is the interpretation and significance of the words of the Living Lord in the present time. The basis of his teachings consists of \"tendency towards the truth\" and this means to be inclined towards existence and presence instead of to lean towards the illusion. That is to say, being inclined toward God, God- worshiping, God-seeking, God-centeredness, God-infatuation, God-mindfulness, God-observance, God-infatuation instead of being inclined towards oneself, self-worshiping, selfishness, self-conceit, self-infatuation, and self-centeredness. In the art of transcendental life, the emphasis is on quality, introversion, and worship of the Lining One rather than extroversion and worship of dead.</ref>\n\nThe second level is called ''Astronomical Level'' or ''Transcendental Arts'' which is related to metaphysical techniques or Psychotechnology and consists of teachings of mysteries. This level is meant for the selected and admitted individuals and due to its mysterious nature, quite a little information has been publicized about its details.<ref>More information could be retrieved at [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Fattahi's autobiography], page 112</ref><br />\n \nElia does not charge the attendees for his teachings but he believes the student's self is the price of their training.<ref>same</ref>\n\n===Other branches of Elia's public teachings===\nIn addition to [[spirituality|spiritual]] and cognitive teachings, Fattahi has held some tutorials for a limited number of his students during which they have been trained in more specialized fields. Science of Success, Harmonical Marriage, Sublime Nutrition, Creative Speaking, Methods of Sublime Struggling, Methods of Writing, Lecturing and Doing research, [[wikt:symbolism|Symbolism]] and Nature-based [[Semiotics]], Methods of Dynamic and Coordinated Therapy, Techniques of Analyzing and Interpreting of the Articles, and Esoteric [[Anthropology]] are some of his semi-public teaching courses.<ref>same</ref>\n\n====Thinking Methods====\nOne of the most pivotal branches of Fattahi's teachings is called ''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Teach/Teach9/1710/ XZY]'' or ''36 Methods of Sublime Thinking''. Methods such as [http://prothinka.org/Article/2887/ Creative Thinking], [http://prothinka.org/Article/2886/ Pattern-extractor Thinking] as well as Conceptualizer Thinking, Foresighter, Symmetrizing and Ultra-viewing methods could be noted.

This can be concluded regarding his activities within the recent years which was mainly focused on the field of thinking and thought. Some of the El-Yasin affiliated institutions such as [http://www.pmrg.ir/portal Professional Management Research Group] (PMRG) as well as [[www.prothinka.com|Association of Thinkers and Researchers]] have also been very active in discussion and transcription of Fattahi's thinking methods ever since.\n\n===Non-public Teachings===\nAnother aspect of Fattahi's teaching is focused on [[esoteric]] knowledge. It's been called ''Astronomical level'', ''ZX methods'' or Psychotechnology in which Creative Dreaming (dream making), Spiritual Communication, Teletransportation, Energy Hunting and Parallel Experiencing are taught to the trainees.<br />\nFattahi believes such trainings are not necessary for the public, therefore, he has recommended them to a limited number of his followers who have been selected and admitted by precise and strict criteria. According to Fattahi's followers, it's necessary for an esoteric apprentice to be committed to some strict rules such as keeping anonymity, protecting the mysterious techniques, avoiding the use of their abilities for personal means and complying with some unusual conditions.<ref>More information could be retrieved from [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Aamin, vol.1], page 12</ref>\n\nRegardless to the detailed content of all above-mentioned categories, Fattahi considers the extract of his teachings in the divine phrase ''There is no deity other than Him/Her'' (La Elaha Ella Hou).<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, 1998</ref>\n\n==Lectures==\nThe first rounds of Master Elia's public lectures were begun at his age of 23 (1996) in [[Tehran]]. These lectures used to be held mostly in cultural centers and community halls and were extremely welcomed by different categories of audiences especially youth, [[students]], writers, [[intellectuals]] and [[scholars]]. \nBefore being forced to stop by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Iran)]], the organizers had to arrange his lectures in the largest [[auditoriums]] of Tehran with the capacity for admission of thousands of people, but, those auditoriums were not spacious enough for eager audiences, therefore, further sessions were carried out with [[wikt:audio|audio]] or video playback.\n\nThose lectures were generally given in various subjects such as:\n* [[Faith]], the key of human [[salvation]]\n* [[Thinking]] and its methods\n* [[wikt:divine|Divine]] [[Parables]]\n* Calling on God\n* God is the one\n* Review and analysis of Eastern mysticism\n* Guiles and traps of the [[Devil]]\n* Observation and methods of controlling [[ego (spirituality)|ego]]\n* God's holy names\n* [[Parapsychology]] and Science of success\n* The art of [[transcendentals|transcendental]] living; the sublime life\n* God's [[blessing]], God's [[Divine grace|grace]]\n* Gratitude to God\n* Divine communication\n* Methods of [[worshiping]] and the keys to materialization of a wish\n* [[The Art of Dreaming|Dreaming]] and creative observation\n* Female-dominance or male-dominance?\n* The Superior President\n* Your attitude is determinant to your [[future]]\n* Determinative words\n* ...\n\nIn the following years, under serious pressures of the Security Office against Religions and Religious Minorities, the lectures were held less frequently. Not a day passed without direct or indirect attacks from radical [[clergies]] in their bid to control the scene of culture and religion. \nIn Spring 2005, during a lecture at the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium]] in Tehran, a direct and physical attack was mounted by undercover agents in a bid to harm and arrest Elia.<ref>To watch a footage of this event click [http://ostad-iliya.org/MovieEn/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=114 here] or [http://ostad-iliya.org/Movie/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=103 here] .</ref> Although, he was not arrested as a result of participants' robust defense but this session is considered as the last public meeting of Master Elia M. Ramollah since 2005. It is worth mentioning that in winter 2007 a plan was set to hold a speech session in [[Azadi Stadium]] (Tehran) with a capacity to admit 100,000 audiences, but it was dropped due to strong disagreement of the authorities at [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Ministry of Intelligence and Security of Iran]].\n\n==From the critics' point of view==\nFattahi's name (Elia M. Ramollah) was first mentioned by [[Kayhan|''Kayhan'' newspaper]]<ref>Kayhan newspaper, 28/03/1383- Persian calendar</ref> (the organ of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]) as a perverted character (2004). His name was published once again in ''Kayhan''<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> and ''[[Resalat (newspaper)|Resalat]]''<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref> newspapers a few months before his first detention in 2007 by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Security service of Iran]].\n\nTaking the actions of Iranian governmental newspapers and TVs into account, one can conclude that despite having thousands of followers and admirers, Fattahi is faced with serious [[dogmatic]] [[critics]] some of which accuse him of heresy and claiming [[prophecy]], and categorize his teachings as a [[New religious movement]] (NRM).<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref>\n\nSome others, however, consider him as the master of a tempting and [[Subversion|subversive]] [[sect]], related to global [[Zionism]] networks, related to [[Freemasonry|Masons]], a talented [[Hypnotize Minds|mesmerizer]], [[wizard (paranormal)|wizard]], a neo-[[Rasputin]] and a [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] promoter.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhouri Eslami]] newspaper published an article titled ''A God who is the 13th child of his family'' in which Fattahi was introduced as a person claiming [[deity]].<ref>Jomhouri Eslami newspaper, No. 8619, 02/03/1388- persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn brief, various calumnious accusations surfaced against Fattahi were:\nThe new [[Messiah]], [[Krishnamurti]]'s next ring, the [[Devil]], spirit of Messiah, the prophet of non-believers and non-religious, the preacher of spirituality without religion, US and Western power's agent, a preacher of negative resistance, 21st century wizard, Mahatma Elia, the second [[Gandhi]], the second [[Martin Luther|Luther]], the 3rd [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], corrupted, excommunicated, leader of American culture, a preacher of spiritual innovation and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], harbinger of so-called Elia-ism, and a deity claimant.\n\nTo address the accusations claimed by Fattahi's opponents, the 6th branch of the Special Court for Governmental Staffs was authorized to open a special case against him (2006), and recalled the possible plaintiffs through a public announcement by [[Kayhan]] to lodge their complaints.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> However, the case was closed without any specific result due to lack of plaintiffs.<ref>[http://www.ettelaat.net/08-maj/news.asp?id=28905 Ettelaat Net]</ref>\n\nElia's opponents do not deny his ability and knowledge in different areas but unlike his fans who consider it as an entitlement of a divine sense, their approach is to destruct and to question his talents.\nSome of them claim that his charismatic character has its root on his childhood and the family issues he was facing combined with an essence of talent and innate genius: \n''Due to his family problems, especially mental turbulent atmosphere full of family conflicts, he was forced to quit school and became solitary and isolated.''<ref>Anonymous,''Elia, Ramollah, the Avatar and ...'', Kajraheh Supplement, Jam e Jam Newspaper, March 2007, p. 18</ref> <br />\n \nSome other opponents attribute his talents to extensive studies in various fields:\n''Later on, he began studying the metaphysics books and documents such as Psycho technology, halo vision, dreaming, Maha-meditation, energy healing and other so-called science including cosmic science. He then met some celebrities and masters in this area\u2026''<ref>same</ref>\n\n''Despite lack of formal education and classical studies, he took advantage of his talents and proportional abilities to compensate his personality defects very well.''<ref>same</ref>\n\nFattahi has responded to some of these allegations in this way:\n\n''Question: Some believe you are insane or a wizard. Why should they believe so?''\n\nAnswer: \"If I would use the opposite medicine you would use to cure the same illness, we shall, naturally, take each other for insane. It is not your fault to call me mad for you to realize the way I act, think or move is contrary to your expectations. Since you take yourself as a wise person, you will naturally call mad and insane whoever moves and thinks unlike you\u2026those who call me sorcerer and wizard want to relieve their conscience and actually assert themselves and maintain their claims.\nThey hear my teachings and get impressed and see that others are impressed as well. They observe changes and evolution, awakenings and cries and are thus faced with divine power and holy teachings. However, they think if they accept these teachings, the colossal palace they have built in their conceit will collapse and their false and superficial rightfulness will be denounced. They believe accepting the teachings of God's Spirit jeopardizes their profits\u2026They see the divine power yet because it goes against their egoistic aspirations they attack the person and individuality of the teacher. They calumniate him and investigate his personality.\"<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Page 123-124</ref>\n\nThere have been several statements officially published by Elyasin Community as a response to rumors and allegations about Peyman Fattahi.<ref>These statements have originally been issued between 1990 and 1997 by the Office of Public Relations of the community and republished to clarify his followers' attitude toward those rumors. To read an extract of them click [http://www.ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/ here].</ref>\n\nFattahi's devotees do believe most of these rumors and allegations have been already responded in officially issued statements, however, many of them have been actively challenging with such destructive acts specifically after the open conflicts of Iranian security service with their master and leader. They have expressed their disagreement with these demolition jobs mostly by compiling books, publishing articles, film making, and blogging and are still working on these issues.\n\nIn spite of their attempts to respond to the allegations and rumors, destructive acts by Fattahi's opponents are still ongoing, using the governmental tribunes and in form of publishing articles, circulation of free bulletins and digests, broadcasting TV serials and round-tables as well as making fake and fabricated documentaries. In Summer 2011, a report was published by Religions and Faiths Watch<ref>http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/308/1/ Corruptors and Demons!</ref> about the exhibition and fairs held by [[Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom|Qom Seminary]] and the [http://www.ido.ir/en/en-default.aspx Islamic Development Organization] (IDO). In those events, an extensive attack has been designated to happen against Green movement leaders ([[Mirhossein Mousavi|Mousavi]], [[Mehdi KARUBI|Karubi]] and [[Seyed Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]]), U.S. presidents ([[Barack Obama]] and [[George W. Bush]]), European presidents (like [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]), some Iranian intellectuals and dissidents (such as Dr [[Abdolkarim Soroush|Soroush]], [[Mohsen Kadivar]], [[Akbar Ganji]], [[Alireza Nourizadeh]], [[Mohsen Sazegara]]). In these sets of exhibitions, further to Peyman Fattahi (known as Master Elia \u2013 the leader of Elyasin Community) some spiritual movements (such as [[Baha'i]]s and [[Dervish]]es) and spiritual leaders (such as [[Dalai Lama]], [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], Paul Twitchel \u2013 the master of [[Eckankar]] and Li Hongzhi \u2013 the master of [[Falun Dafa]]) has been targeted by Iranian extremist clergies.\n\nFurthermore, a TV programme entitled ''[[Armageddon]]'' (the final battle between the good and evil) has been broadcast by the News Channel of Islamic republic of Iran (IRINN) and other governmental media (2011). The TV series consists of 104 episodes, some of which have been replayed several times by governmental TV. According to the latest report of ''Association of Thinkers and Researcher''<ref>''The 45th attack of Iranian extremist clergies to Master Elia'' (Summary of Armageddon TV Series, episode 25), Paris Keynezhad \u2013 Senior member of Association of THikers and Researchers</ref> episode 25 begins with blatant lies and demolition jobs on Elia M. then continues doing the same against the author [[Paulo Coelho]].

A number of his close associates and followers were also arrested<ref>[[Khabarnet]], 13 July 2009</ref> including two of his brothers, Keyvan and Ramin Fattahi.\n\nIn 2004, Fattahi and his followers began to gain attention in the mainstream media, with an incendiary editorial in a hard-line national newspaper portraying Fattahi as a miscreant.<ref>[[Kayhan]], 17 June 2004</ref> Several more articles were published in hard-line newspapers since then (Resalat, Kayhan, Jam e jam, Jomhouri Eslami), with the charges leveled at Fattahi and his group taking on a more serious air. These reports and the growing magnitude of his public events may have ultimately contributed to his arrest.\n\n\"On May 27, 2007, Master Fattahi (known as Eliya M) was arrested by the \"Department against Religions and Religious Minorities\" (DARRM). He was sent to notorious security ward 209 of [[Evin prison]]. Afraid of his follower's support, the security officials were at loss to decide on jailing him. According to DARRM statement, Eliya M. was finally arrested by the decision of high-ranking religious officials. A council consist of highest-ranking religious and cleric powers of Iran decided that Eliya M. should be quietly arrested under charges of permuting the religion (Islam), proselytism, an invitation to spiritual pluralism, conspiracy against the Islamic government, renewal of religion by linking Islam, Christianity and Judaism; spiritual liberalism and incitement to the so \u0640 called American Islam and many other routine accusations that are used in these cases such as Offending sacred symbols of religion, a conspiracy by creating underground secret society and cult (Eliya \u0640 ism). But he had only one crime: he was against the Islam that calls for violence... Eliya was arrested for spiritual liberty, for a different interpretation of God's words which was against the cold stagnant understanding of religion.\".<ref>Extracted from [http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/40/36/ the first open letter of Elia's followers to leaders of the world]</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Peyman Fattahi was released on a bail of 300 million Tomans (almost 300,000 USD) after spending six months in prison, suffering from recurrent bleeding from nose and ears, bloody vomiting and bloody urination.<ref>[[U.S Department of State]] annual report on Iran Human Rights.

[[U.S. Department of State]] and [[Amnesty International]] have mentioned in their annual reports about human rights abuses and violations against Elyasin Community and its leadership (Peyman Fattahi) by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nSome of the most important events during Fattahi's re-arrest can be cited as:\n# Publishing a testimonial film about one of Fattahi's students who had been detained on the first round (2007) in which he was claiming the interrogators had forced him to act against Fattahi and lodge a complaint against him.

Although there is no press released report available on this matter.\n\n===Third Detention===\nOn 24 July 2011, a report was published about Fatahi's third detention along with a number of his students and members of Association of Thinkers and Researchers.<ref>To original script of the news could be retrieved from this [http://prothinka.org/News/3381/ link]</ref>\n\nA few days later, the official spokesperson of Elyasin Community who resides in UK<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/people/Paris-Keynejad/1108926967 Paris Keynezhad]</ref> verified this news by publishing an announcement but she mentioned they have all been released shortly after detention and none of the Elyasin members are under arrest. Some other key members of Elyasin verified this official announcement as well.<ref>The statement can be retrieved from this [http://www.emruznews.com/2011/08/post-7081.php link]</ref>\n\nImmediately after publishing of this announcement [[Tabnak]] and some the government- related blogs and websites began to widely publish a short note about Fattahi's arrest in which the event was distorted.<ref>[http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/179079/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C-%C2%AB%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%C2%BB Tabnak], 02/05/1390 \u2013 Persian calendar, news code# 179079</ref> Fattahi's followers do believe re-publishing of this news firstly by Tabnak then by the other government affiliated websites have happened to proceed with the aim of [[psychological war]] against Fattahi and Elyasin Community.\n\nHowever, this act brought an immediate response from Fattahi's followers in the form of publishing an open letter from members of [http://www.prothinka-src.org Association of Thinkers and Researchers (overseas branch)] to world leaders. To read the letter you can click [http://prothinka-src.org/Persian/Show_News.php?msg=596 here].\n\n==Elyasin (Ale-Yasin) Community==\nAfter Fattahi's first detention in June 2007, the institutions and non-governmental organizations that were directly or indirectly supervised and directed by him, integrated and announced the formation of a unique organization named El-Yasin (Ale-Yasin) community.\nThis community was working without being dependent on any political party of the group and their activities were mainly focused on research and studying of cultural- spiritual matters, but its members were prosecuted and their activities were harshly suppressed by the security service of Iran. Elyasin consists of a number of NGO's and publishing houses, most of which have been banned and shut time from the time of Ahmadinejad's presidency. There are some magazines affiliated to Elyasin such as ''Art of Living'', ''Esoteric Knowledge'', ''Motivators'', [[Science of Success (magazine)|''Science of Success'']], ''The Art of Transcendental Life'', and ''Sublime Thinking''. \nAvamer-e-Yasin, Science of Success, [http://www.prothinka.com Association of Thinkers and Researchers], Nature Front Association, Yasin Society of Writers and Researchers (Payam), and [http://ayahra.org/en Elyasin Human Rights and International Affairs] are some of Elyasin treaty bodies to be noted.\nIt's worth mentioning that Fattahi's followers are generally known as 'Elahioun' who can be recognized in different sub-categories such as \"Mansouroun (Elias' Offsprings)\", Iliya Supporters, The protectors of Elia M., Ghadr and Payam 1,2,3 groups, and Sina group (Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques trainees and apprentices).\nFattahi's devotees are running a number of active blogs and websites at the moment.\n\n==Written Works and confiscated books==\n'''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Jaryane-_Hedayate-Elahi_edition-2.pdf The Flow of Divine Guidance]''' is the only published book which is a transcription of Fattahi's public speeches at the age of 23. This book has been compiled by one of his close disciples and primarily published in 1998. However, this book was banned after the first publishing. His followers claim thousands of copies of it have been printed and distributed by Fattahi's devotees inside and outside of Iran. \nThere are more than 30 books have been confiscated by Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran) including:<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/ILIYA-CV-en.pdf Victims of ruthlessness]</ref>\n\n# The \"Teachings of Truth\" canon which contains some of his speeches and lectures.\n# \"Esoteric schools and the mysterious meanings in manuscripts\"\n# \"Sublime thinking and methods of creative thinking\" (consist of thirty six methods of thinking)\n# \"Thinking Formulas and Mental Software\"(consist of more than seven hundred thinking formulas to do different works)\n# \"The Art of Sublime Struggle\"\n# [[Hezbollah]] Doctrine (The Army of God Doctrine) (on inviting Hezbollah to use flexible methods and software thinking and to avoid violence and increase tendency to love)\n# \"Universal Theories and Modern Spirituality\"\n# \"Fundamental Life patterns\"\n# \"True Intuitions and False interpretations\"\n# \"The Art of Dreaming in Elahism (creative dreaming and dream making)\"\n# \"Esoteric judgment and true justice\"\n# \"Harmonious and Disharmonic Marriage\"\n# \"Saviors of the World and Motivators\"\n# \"Fundamental Insights and Enlivening Thoughts\"\n# \"The Ancient Science of Semiotics\"(understanding the signs of the world around us)\n# \"Teaching revolutionary counseling\"\n# \"Inward Interpretations of outward verses or signs\"\n# \"Creative Look; constructive thoughts and inventive words\"\n# \"The Meanings of Nature Sounds and Birds Songs\"\n# \"The Future of the World, Civilizations and Religions\"\n# \"The Knowledge of Names and Luminous Keys\"\n# \"The Methods of Predicting future\"\n# \"Cults and Anti Cults\" (on what cults are and analyzing and controlling them)\n# \"The Correspondence\"(letters, questions, messages and recommendations to the leaders of the world, scientists and scholars)\n\n==Doctrines and Fundamental Theories==\nAccording to Fattahi's old allies a large number of [[doctrine]]s and fundamental theories have been proposed by him since 20 years ago.<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Ammin, vol.1], page 452-454,</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been usually suggested during public speeches and meetings as well as personal conversations and discussions on the daily routine. Then, they have been further analyzed by students who have been responsible for collecting them. Although most of these theories are esoteric-based and esoteric-oriented, they do concern all aspects of life and sometimes are linked to the details of daily life.\nThe doctrines of Sublime Struggle, Reconciliation of Civilizations, Creative Look, Harmonious Marriage, as well as the doctrine of coordination, doctrine Suprapolar Human Being (bipolar man), the doctrine of 360-degree view are some of which could be mentioned in this regard. Also, the theories of Intuitive References, Creative Review and the doctrine of Voluntary and Recurrent Death could be noted.<ref>same</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been collected and further discussed by a number of his students in a multi-volume set of books entitled ''360 Doctrines and Comprehensive Theories''. This collection has been recently{{when|date=November 2011}} registered at the [[Library of Congress]] parts of which are previously published through his students' websites.<ref>Some of them could be read at this [http://ostad-iliya.org/En/ link]</ref> They have also claimed the complete collection has set to be published in the near future.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://ostad-iliya.org\n* http://ayahra.org/en\n* http://safireaseman.com\n* http://aleyassin.blogspot.com/\n* http://master-iliya.blogfa.com/\n* http://www.revayatgaran-iliya.blogfa.com/\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fattahi, Peyman}}\n[[Category:Iranian reformists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:Prisoners and detainees of Iran]]\n[[Category:Iranian prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:Iranian scholars]]\n", "name_user": "Leo Flamin' Valdez", "label": "safe", "comment": "small grammatical corrections.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyman_Fattahi"}

The MCFC [[Manchester City F.C.#Current squad|official first team squad]] consists of about 40 players, which is why the EDS players' squad numbers start in the region of the middle forties.  For the [[Professional Development League|Premier League 2]], players use the 1\u201311 numbering system whilst [[squad number (association football)|squad numbers]] (including player names) are used for the [[EFL Trophy]].\n\nThe MCFC first team squad numbers are normally assigned and published in late July during the close season and they remain constant for the entire duration of the upcoming season (meaning that a squad number that is assigned to a player in the close season who subsequently wears that number in a competitive match, but who later leaves the club during that same season, will not be assigned to another player during the remainder of that season).\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Updated|27 January 2020}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CITY EDS |url=https://www.mancity.com/teams/eds

From 1951 the 'A' team competed in the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] against reserve and youth teams of other clubs from North West England. From 1955 a second youth team, the 'B' team, typically comprising younger players than the 'A' team, competed in Division Two of the Lancashire League.\n\nYouth football in England was restructured by [[the Football Association]] in 1997, with the introduction of the [[FA Premier Academy League|Academy]] system. Current International Youth Academy Director [[Jim Cassell]] joined from [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in July 1997 and was responsible for building Manchester City's youth structure, which gained Academy accreditation in 1998.\n\nIn its new incarnation, the 'A' and 'B' teams were replaced with 'Under-19' and 'Under-17' teams, which competed in the FA Premier Youth League. Since gaining FA approval the Academy has produced 35 first team players, 15 of whom have gained full international honours, including [[England national football team|England]] internationals [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]], [[Micah Richards]] and [[Joey Barton]]. The academy not only produces players for Manchester City but also players that have the talent to make the grade elsewhere, with players such as [[Glenn Whelan]] building a successful career at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and now [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Dickson Etuhu]] similarly making his career at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]\n\n===Present day===\nSince the club was [[Ownership of Manchester City F.C.#Abu Dhabi United Group buyout|taken over in September 2008]], with extra capital and increased ambitions the club looked to expand their successful academy further afield<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Blues Academy to go global\n|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1124085_blues_academy_to_go_global\n|publisher=MEN Media\n|date=2 July 2009\n|accessdate=11 August 2010\n}}</ref> and City in the Community programme in [[Manchester]].

The MCFC [[Manchester City F.C.#Current squad|official first team squad]] consists of about 40 players, which is why the EDS players' squad numbers start in the region of the middle forties.  For the [[Professional Development League|Premier League 2]], players use the 1\u201311 numbering system whilst [[squad number (association football)|squad numbers]] (including player names) are used for the [[EFL Trophy]].\n\nThe MCFC first team squad numbers are normally assigned and published in late July during the close season and they remain constant for the entire duration of the upcoming season (meaning that a squad number that is assigned to a player in the close season who subsequently wears that number in a competitive match, but who later leaves the club during that same season, will not be assigned to another player during the remainder of that season).\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Updated|27 January 2020}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CITY EDS |url=https://www.mancity.com/teams/eds

From 1951 the 'A' team competed in the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] against reserve and youth teams of other clubs from North West England. From 1955 a second youth team, the 'B' team, typically comprising younger players than the 'A' team, competed in Division Two of the Lancashire League.\n\nYouth football in England was restructured by [[the Football Association]] in 1997, with the introduction of the [[FA Premier Academy League|Academy]] system. Current International Youth Academy Director [[Jim Cassell]] joined from [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in July 1997 and was responsible for building Manchester City's youth structure, which gained Academy accreditation in 1998.\n\nIn its new incarnation, the 'A' and 'B' teams were replaced with 'Under-19' and 'Under-17' teams, which competed in the FA Premier Youth League. Since gaining FA approval the Academy has produced 35 first team players, 15 of whom have gained full international honours, including [[England national football team|England]] internationals [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]], [[Micah Richards]] and [[Joey Barton]]. The academy not only produces players for Manchester City but also players that have the talent to make the grade elsewhere, with players such as [[Glenn Whelan]] building a successful career at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and now [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Dickson Etuhu]] similarly making his career at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]\n\n===Present day===\nSince the club was [[Ownership of Manchester City F.C.#Abu Dhabi United Group buyout|taken over in September 2008]], with extra capital and increased ambitions the club looked to expand their successful academy further afield<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Blues Academy to go global\n|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1124085_blues_academy_to_go_global\n|publisher=MEN Media\n|date=2 July 2009\n|accessdate=11 August 2010\n}}</ref> and City in the Community programme in [[Manchester]].

He was very fond of Chhotoma whose husband was Bibhuti, the very first scholar of the village before Girija. Bibhuti changed his religion to Christianity so Chhotoma refused to go with him to City after death of Bibhuti's elder brother, Kalidas, who was a religious person and a critic of Bibhuti's religious transformation. Besides, Girija left his village for higher studies and came back after a long time. All of his villagers believed him to be rich. After few days, everyone came to know about his poor financial condition. His only daughter Bimala was attracted to Block Development Officer Pravakar. As Girijaprasad was not rich, everybody tried to neglect him and helped his only brother Girin who stayed in the same village. Girin was a wealthy person and very clever kind of man. He deprived his elder brother and tried to make relation with Pravakar. But in the end, Girija's daughter Bimala was married to Pravakar instead of Girin's daughter Tia in the intervention of Girin's wife. On the other hand, Udas Kotal a soft-hearted, honest man wanted to learn driving for a better life. He married Laxmimoni to learn driving from his father-in-law. Laxmimoni's father taught him driving and made him an expert driver. Unfortunately, Laxmimoni had some psychological problem and as a result, she committed suicide. Udas became very upset and after few days, he wanted to get married his childhood friend Padma but Padma refused to get married. Day by day Udas became an alcoholic, characterless bohemian kind of person. One day after a quarrel, he hears baseless and incorrect news that Padma was having an affair with the doctor, he goes to murder the doctor with a knife. In the darkness, drunken Udas killed his old mate Padma. As a result, he was convicted and sentenced to death.
