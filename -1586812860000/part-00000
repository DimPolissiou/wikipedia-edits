Although the platform of the [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] was used to underpin the new Scirocco, almost every part of the car was re-engineered in favour of a new styling (penned by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]) which was sleeker and sportier than that of the Golf. The Scirocco debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1973|1973 Geneva Motor Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/10-revolutionary-geneva-motor-show-debuts-of-the-last-50-years|title=10 revolutionary Geneva Motor Show debuts in the last 50 years|last=Prince|first=Max|date=2014-02-28|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n\nLaunched six months before the Golf, in order to resolve any teething troubles before production of the high volume hatchback started,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciroccoregisterforum.co.uk/index.php?p=1_5_Scirocco-Timeline |title=Scirocco Timeline |publisher=Sciroccoregisterforum.co.uk |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> the Scirocco went on sale in Europe in 1974 and in North America in 1975. Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo \u2013 Das Auto, das es nie gab \u2013 Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]\nThe '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coup\u00e9 icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> \nIts high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years. The 1975 models are 1.5&nbsp;L (1471&nbsp;cc), followed by a larger 1.6 with {{convert|76|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=RTbg79>{{citation | ref = RT79 | title = Four Sports Coupes | work = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1979 | date = January\u2013February 1979 | publisher = CBS Publications | location = Greenwich, CT | page = 31 }}</ref> For 1978 Volkswagen reverted to a short-stroke 1.5 (now of 1457&nbsp;cc), stating that this made meeting emissions requirements easier.

One feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined \"<small>SCIROCCO</small>\" script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.\n[[File:VW Scirocco II rear 20070518.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view, late Scirocco GTX (Germany)]]\n\nHalfway through the 1984 model year, a new space-saver spare wheel was added, that provided room for a larger fuel tank (with a second \"transfer\" fuel pump). Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. \n\nEleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models.

Type 1 models featured a range of four-cylinder engines with displacements from 1.1 to 1.6 litres, with a 1.7 also offered in North America, all featuring a single-overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe design of the vehicle combined with the lack of US [[Department of Transportation|D.O.T.]] approved rectangular headlights, made it necessary to have four round headlights, two for low beam use and two for high beam use for all the cars imported to USA. However, the European \"TS\" version, for which maximum power was listed as {{Convert|85|PS|hp kW|abbr=on}}, was easily distinguishable from the less powerful \"L\" and \"S\" (50 and 70 PS) versions which came with just two rectangular headlights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> An automatic transmission option was added in January 1975.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Automatic transmission-equipped Sciroccos were generally rare outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |title=Blech der Woche (23): VW Scirocco Turbo \u2013 Das Auto, das es nie gab \u2013 Auto & Mobil |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211140308/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/automobil/720/313626/text/ |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco GTi.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Scirocco GTi]]\nThe '''Scirocco GTi''' entered production in the summer of 1976, while the later cult Golf GTI wasn't unveiled until the autumn of the same year.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-coupe-icon-2276  www.volkswagen-newsroom] The coup\u00e9 icon- Retrieved 21 Feb 2020.</ref> \nIts high-revving, 81 kW / 110 horsepower 1.6-litre engine featured mechanical fuel injection, 175/70HR13 tires on 5.5Jx13 wheels, a larger duckbill style front spoiler, a red frame for the grille, and the standard car's solid front brake discs were replaced with 9.4 in (239 mm) ventilated discs.

In 1977, the GTE and LS were offered with the 1.5L engine and the fuel injection technology from Bosch. The GTE was available with either the 4-speed manual transmission or the 3-speed automatic, while the LS offered the automatic only. Sales of the Scirocco continued for this entire generation to Japanese buyers, and it was in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] which helped sales. The engines offered to Japanese buyers were the smaller displacement versions to reduce the annual Japanese [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation.\n \nThe car changed little before being replaced by the second generation in March 1981 (Europe).<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 138</ref> However, air conditioning became available as an option on the domestic market in August 1975.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport1975>{{cite magazine| authorlink = | title = Nachrichten aus der Technik: Klimaanlage f\u00fcr VW Golf und Scirocco (Technical news: air conditioning for VW Golf and Scirocco)|magazine= [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u.

On cars produced after the summer break in August 1975 (for the 1976 model year), the conventional two wiper system changed to a single wiper which parks on the passenger side of the windscreen, while the driver also benefited from improved, lighter, steering linkage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 88</ref> In August 1977 (for model year 1978) the separate front side marker and turn signal, changed to a combination wrap-around orange lens. At the same time, behind the doors the B-pillar colour changed from body colour to black, which was thought to give the car a more pleasing profile.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>   Other mid-life changes include the move from chrome bumpers with rubberised end caps to a plastic-coated one-piece wrap around bumper.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Oswald Band 3|Oswald 1945 - 90 (vol 3)]], p 89</ref> In 1979, the one-piece \"flag\" style outside mirrors transitioned to a two-piece shrouded mirror.  \n\nThere were also special variants throughout the Type 1 production. Most distinguishable by paint schemes and trim, there were special versions called \"Sidewinder\", \"Sidewinder II\", \"Champagne Edition\", \"Champagne Edition II\" and the \"S\". The Champagne Edition II only came in white with black accents and a Zender front spoiler. On the NA models the 1980 \"S\" versions came in only three colours, Alpine White, Black and Mars Red with unique colour accents. This \"S\" model differed from the base model by having blacked out chrome trim, day glow additions to the exterior trim, Recaro designed sports seats, white letter tires, sport strips and a standard five-speed transmission. This was followed by the 1981 \"S\" versions which only came in Cosmos Silver Metallic, Cirrus Gray Metallic and Mars Red without the colour accents. Steel sunroofs were an available option on both the \"S\" non-\"S\" vehicles. Unlike the sunroofs on the second-generation Sciroccos introduced in 1982, these earlier versions only tilted open. They did not slide back but could be removed and stored in a special fabric folder and placed in the trunk hatch. Not forgetting the addition of the \"Storm\" models, available in two colours with a run of 250 cars in each colour.\n\n===North America===\nThe 1975-1978 model year USA vehicles had four-speed manual transmissions; for the 1979-1980 model years, USA vehicles were offered a five-speed manual transmissions as an option. In 1981 the five-speed became standard. The engine option was mostly limited to one, although it changed frequently over the years.

Leather interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner [[Oettinger (tuner)|Oettinger]] in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show#1983|1983 Frankfurt Motor Show]].<ref name=AG106>{{cite magazine | ref = AG106 | magazine = De AutoGids | number = 106 | volume = 5 | page = 24 | title = Salon: De Kleppenoorlog |trans-title= Motor Show: The Valve War | last = Verhelle | first = Tony | language = nl-be | date = 1983-10-13 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> It went on sale in Germany and a few other markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986.

Special limited edition models including the White Cat (Europe), Tropic (Europe), Storm (UK), Slegato (Canada), and Wolfsburg Edition (USA and Canada) were also produced. These special models typically featured unique interior/exterior color combinations, special alloy wheels and had special combinations of options such as leather, multifunction trip computer and/or power windows as standard.\n\nScirocco sales continued until 1992 in Germany, the UK, and some other European markets. The Scirocco was briefly joined but effectively replaced by the [[Volkswagen Corrado|Corrado]] in the VW line-up, although this had been on sale since 1988 and was aimed further upmarket.\n\nThe Scirocco continued to be offered to Japanese buyers, but only the GTi with the 1.8 L engine in either manual or automatic transmissions, but starting with 1986 only the automatic transmission was offered. It did continue to comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations.\n\n===North America===\nSpecifications in North America are somewhat different from those of cars sold in the rest of the world, due to the differing safety and emissions regulations in place there. In North America, 1982 and 1983 models produce {{convert|74|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|90|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The engine code was EN. The 1984 models produce {{convert|90|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, the engine code was JH. In mid-1986, a 16-valve model was released in the United States and Canada, which included a full body skirt, larger rear spoiler, and tear-drop shaped wheel slots to distinguish it from Type 2 8-valve models. Sales continued until 1988 in the United States, 1989 in Canada, being effectively replaced in both markets by the more expensive Corrado.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Mk3|13}}Third generation (2008\u20132017)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = VW Scirocco III 2.0 TSI DSG Collectors Edition 54 von 100 Oryxwei\u00df.JPG\n| production = 2008\u20132017\n| assembly = Portugal: [[Palmela]] ([[AutoEuropa]])\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]]\n| platform = [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|Volkswagen Group A5 platform]]\n| engine = 1.4 L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] ([[Petrol engine|petrol]])<br />2.0 L I4 (petrol)<br />2.0 L I4 ([[Diesel engine|diesel]])\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] ([[Direct-Shift Gearbox|DSG]])<br />7-speed automatic (DSG)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2578|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4256|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1404|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|2862|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}-{{convert|1450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]]<br />[[Volkswagen Eos]]<br />[[SEAT Le\u00f3n]] Mk2\n| predecessor = [[Volkswagen Corrado]]\n| designer = [[Walter de Silva]]<br />Marc Lichte\n}}\n\n[[File:Volkswagen Scirocco 2008 67 (8451971989).jpg|thumbnail|left|Pre-facelift Scirocco (Europe)]]\nVolkswagen officially announced in June 2006 production of a new Scirocco model at the [[AutoEuropa]] assembly plant in [[Palmela]], Portugal.<ref name=\"announcement\">{{\ncite news\n|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/Unternehmen/Industrie/pshb/fn/relhbi/sfn/buildhbi/cn/GoArt!200012,200038,1095675/SH/0/depot/0/neuer-vw-scirocco-kommt-aus-portugal.html\n|publisher=Handelsblatt\n|title=Neuer VW Scirocco kommt aus Portugal\n|trans-title=New VW Scirocco to come from Portugal\n|date=June 20, 2006\n|language=german\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n{{anchor|Iroc}}\n\nThe new model, identified by the internal type numbers 137 or 1K8, is based on the [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5 (PQ35)|PQ35 platform]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf V]] and was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2008|2008 Geneva Motor Show]].

{"title_page": "Paraphrase mass", "text_new": "[[File:Josquin Missa BV Kyrie.jpg|thumb|Manuscript showing the opening Kyrie of the ''[[Missa de Beata Virgine (Josquin)|Missa de Beata Virgine]]'', a late work by [[Josquin des Prez]], and a paraphrase mass.  Each of the voices sings a version of the source plainchant, elaborated or \"paraphrased\".|300px]]\nA '''paraphrase mass''' is a musical setting of the [[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]] of the [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that uses as its basis an elaborated version of a [[cantus firmus]], typically chosen from [[plainsong]] or some other sacred source.  It was a common means of mass composition from the late 15th century until the end of the 16th century, during the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period in music history, and was most frequently used by composers in the parts of western Europe which remained under the direct control of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  It is distinguished from the other types of mass composition, including [[cyclic mass]], [[parody mass|parody]], [[canon (music)|canon]], [[soggetto cavato]], free composition, and mixtures of these techniques.\n\n==History==\n\nMusical paraphrase, in general, had been used for a long time before it was first applied to the music of the Ordinary of the Mass.  It was common in the early and middle 15th century for a work such as a [[motet]] to use an embellished plainchant melody as its source, with the melody usually in the topmost voice.  [[John Dunstable]]'s ''Gloria'' is an example of this procedure, as are the two settings by [[Guillaume Dufay]] of the [[Marian Antiphon]] ''Alma redemptoris mater.''  Many compositions in [[fauxbourdon]], a characteristic technique of the [[Burgundian School]], use a paraphrased version of a plainchant tune in the highest voice.  In these cases the source would not be obscured by the paraphrase; it was still easily recognizable through whatever ornamentation was applied.<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 608.</ref>\n\nDufay was probably one of the first to use paraphrase technique in the mass. His ''Missa Ave regina celorum'' (written between 1463 and 1474) is similar to a cantus firmus mass in that the tune is in the tenor, however it is paraphrased by elaboration (and he also includes bits of his own motet on that antiphon, foreshadowing the [[parody mass|parody]] technique).  By the 1470s or 1480s, the first masses appear that use paraphrase in more than one voice:  two examples survive by [[Johannes Martini]], the ''Missa domenicalis'' and the ''Missa ferialis''.<ref>Burkholder, Grove</ref>\n\n{{1500smusic|expanded=liturgies}}\n\nBy the beginning of the 16th century, it was becoming more common to use the paraphrased tune in all voices of a polyphonic texture.  The most famous example from the early 16th century, and one of the most famous paraphrase masses ever composed, was the ''[[Missa pange lingua]]'' by [[Josquin des Prez]], which is an extended fantasia on the ''[[Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium|Pange Lingua]]'' hymn for Corpus Christi by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  This mass was probably composed near the end of Josquin's life, around 1520.  In the ''Missa pange lingua'', all voices carry variants of the hymn, with the beginnings of successive phrases marking points of imitation in the mass.  All voices are given equal weight, and the score achieves a motivic unity which was a significant change from previous practice.<ref>Planchart: Sherr, p. 130-150.</ref>\n\nAnother composer of Josquin's generation who was important in the development of the paraphrase mass was [[Pierre de La Rue]].  Like Josquin, he began with the cantus firmus technique, and continued to use it for most of his life; but he began to elaborate the source material, eventually integrating it into multiple voices of a [[polyphony|polyphonic]] texture where all the voices had equal weight.<ref>Meconi, Grove</ref>\n\nLater in the 16th century, paraphrase remained a common technique for construction of masses, although it was employed far less frequently than was parody technique.  [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] used paraphrase technique in 31 of his masses, second only to parody, which he used in 51.<ref>Lockwood, Grove</ref>  Most of his masses based on hymns are paraphrase masses. In these works, the source hymns are often presented in a condensed form.  When the [[Council of Trent]] prohibited the use of secular songs as sources for masses in 1562, a large corpus of music was no longer available to composers who had been ransacking it for parodies; those composers who followed the Council's dictates often returned to using [[monophony|monophonic]] hymns and plainsong, sources which suggested the paraphrase technique.  Indeed, during this period, it was the favored method of using [[Gregorian chant]]s to construct masses.<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 608. </ref>\n\nParaphrase masses were written relatively infrequently in England and Germany, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Composers of masses in those regions developed styles independently, and in both areas tended to use variations of the cantus firmus technique.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* J.

Each of the voices sings a version of the source plainchant, elaborated or \"paraphrased\".|300px]]\nA '''paraphrase mass''' is a musical setting of the [[Ordinary of the Mass|Ordinary]] of the [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that uses as its basis an elaborated version of a [[cantus firmus]], typically chosen from [[plainsong]] or some other sacred source.  It was a common means of mass composition from the late 15th century until the end of the 16th century, during the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period in music history, and was most frequently used by composers in the parts of western Europe which remained under the direct control of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  It is distinguished from the other types of mass composition, including [[cyclic mass]], [[parody mass|parody]], [[canon (music)|canon]], [[soggetto cavato]], free composition, and mixtures of these techniques.\n\n==History==\n\nMusical paraphrase, in general, had been used for a long time before it was first applied to the music of the Ordinary of the mass.  It was common in the early and middle 15th century for a work such as a [[motet]] to use an embellished plainchant melody as its source, with the melody usually in the topmost voice.  [[John Dunstable]]'s ''Gloria'' is an example of this procedure, as are the two settings by [[Guillaume Dufay]] of the [[Marian Antiphon]] ''Alma redemptoris mater.''  Many compositions in [[fauxbourdon]], a characteristic technique of the [[Burgundian School]], use a paraphrased version of a plainchant tune in the highest voice.  In these cases the source would not be obscured by the paraphrase; it was still easily recognizable through whatever ornamentation was applied.<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 608.</ref>\n\nDufay was probably one of the first to use paraphrase technique in the mass. His ''Missa Ave regina celorum'' (written between 1463 and 1474) is similar to a cantus firmus mass in that the tune is in the tenor, however it is paraphrased by elaboration (and he also includes bits of his own motet on that antiphon, foreshadowing the [[parody mass|parody]] technique).  By the 1470s or 1480s, the first masses appear that use paraphrase in more than one voice:  two examples survive by [[Johannes Martini]], the ''Missa domenicalis'' and the ''Missa ferialis''.<ref>Burkholder, Grove</ref>\n\n{{1500smusic|expanded=liturgies}}\n\nBy the beginning of the 16th century, it was becoming more common to use the paraphrased tune in all voices of a polyphonic texture.  The most famous example from the early 16th century, and one of the most famous paraphrase masses ever composed, was the ''[[Missa pange lingua]]'' by [[Josquin des Prez]], which is an extended fantasia on the ''[[Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium|Pange Lingua]]'' hymn for Corpus Christi by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  This mass was probably composed near the end of Josquin's life, around 1520.  In the ''Missa pange lingua'', all voices carry variants of the hymn, with the beginnings of successive phrases marking points of imitation in the mass.  All voices are given equal weight, and the score achieves a motivic unity which was a significant change from previous practice.<ref>Planchart: Sherr, p. 130-150.</ref>\n\nAnother composer of Josquin's generation who was important in the development of the paraphrase mass was [[Pierre de La Rue]].  Like Josquin, he began with the cantus firmus technique, and continued to use it for most of his life; but he began to elaborate the source material, eventually integrating it into multiple voices of a [[polyphony|polyphonic]] texture where all the voices had equal weight.<ref>Meconi, Grove</ref>\n\nLater in the 16th century, paraphrase remained a common technique for construction of masses, although it was employed far less frequently than was parody technique.  [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] used paraphrase technique in 31 of his masses, second only to parody, which he used in 51.<ref>Lockwood, Grove</ref>  Most of his masses based on hymns are paraphrase masses. In these works, the source hymns are often presented in a condensed form.  When the [[Council of Trent]] prohibited the use of secular songs as sources for masses in 1562, a large corpus of music was no longer available to composers who had been ransacking it for parodies; those composers who followed the Council's dictates often returned to using [[monophony|monophonic]] hymns and plainsong, sources which suggested the paraphrase technique.  Indeed, during this period, it was the favored method of using [[Gregorian chant]]s to construct masses.<ref>Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 608. </ref>\n\nParaphrase masses were written relatively infrequently in England and Germany, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Composers of masses in those regions developed styles independently, and in both areas tended to use variations of the cantus firmus technique.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* J.

He became the fifth [[list of heads of state of Afghanistan|Emir of Afghanistan]].<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] \u2013 [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067071/Shah-Shoja Shah Shoja]</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== King of Afghanistan ===\nShuja\u2018 Shah was the governor of [[Herat]] and Peshawar from 1798 to 1801. He proclaimed himself as [[King of Afghanistan]] in October 1801 (after the deposition of his brother [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]), but only properly ascended to the throne on July 13, 1803. In Afghanistan, a blind man by tradition cannot be Emir, and so Shah Shuja\u2018's step-brother Mahmud Shah had Zaman blinded, however not killed.{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=16}} After coming to power in 1803, Shuja\u2018 ended the [[blood feud]] with the powerful [[Barakzai]] family and also forgave them. To create an alliance with them, he married their \"sister\" Wafa Begum.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=23}}\n\nShuja\u2018 allied Afghanistan with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1809, as a means of defending against an invasion of Afghanistan and [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]] by France.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=7}} In 1809, a British diplomatic mission was sent to Afghanistan, which at the time was to the British a remote and mysterious part of Asia. According to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], \"The King of Kabul [Shah Shuja] was a handsome man\". He also wrote \"of an olive complexion with a thick black beard ... his voice clear, his address princely.\" Shuja\u2018 wore the [[Koh-i-Noor]] (\"Mountain of Light\") diamond in one of his bracelets when Elphinstone visited him, but rather undiplomatically described Shuja as having a \"vulgar nose\".{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=6}} [[William Fraser (British India civil servant)|William Fraser]], who accompanied Elphinstone to meet Shah Shuja\u2018 was \"struck with the dignity of his appearance and the romantic Oriental awe.\"{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=20}} Fraser also judged him to be \"about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} tall\" and his skin colour was \"very fair, but dead...his beard was thick jet black and shortened a little by the obliquely upwards, but turned again at the corners ... The eyelashes and the edges of his eyelids were blackened with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|antimony]].\" He also described Shuja's voice as \"loud and sonorous\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Order of the Durrani Empire Afghanistan received by Sir Thomas Willshire 1789 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Order of the Durrani Empire]], founded by Shuja\u2018 Shah in 1839. It was awarded to a number of officers of the [[Bengal Army]]. [[Mus\u00e9e national de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie]].]]\nIn June 1809,{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=27}} he was overthrown by his predecessor [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]] and went into exile in [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]], where he was captured by Jahandad Khan Bamizai and imprisoned at [[Attock]] (1811\u20131812) and then taken to [[Kashmir]] (1812\u20131813) by Atta Muhammad Khan. When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan (vizier)|Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja\u2018 was imprisoned and forced to give up the Timur Ruby, Koh-i-Noor and the sister diamond dray-i-nur diamond to Ranjit Singh.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=23}}He escaped from Ranjit's detention at the Mubarek Haveli Lahore for Ludhiana and the East India Company.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=25}}\n\nFrom 1818 onward, Shuja\u2018 who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Ludhiana where he was joined by Zeman Shah in 1821. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana was occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there used to be a white marble stone commemorating his stay there. {{sfn |Husain|2018|p=386}}\n\n=== Exile ===\nDuring his time in exile, Shuja\u2018 indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja\u2018's court in exile he noted that all of Shuja\u2018's courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an \"earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja\u2018 went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja\u2018 flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja\u2018's grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja\u2018 were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on \"the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor\", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that \"years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break \"into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul\" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with \"Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja\u2018 agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hoisted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the \"legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices\", but rather as \"a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nIn 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja\u2018 marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja\u2018 Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Restoration of power ===\nIn 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan. [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the \"wanton barbarity\" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the \"shrill cry\" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the \"funeral wail\" of the \"unholy policy\" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left.

He proclaimed himself as [[King of Afghanistan]] in October 1801 (after the deposition of his brother [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]), but only properly ascended to the throne on July 13, 1803. In Afghanistan, a blind man by tradition cannot be Emir, and so Shah Shuja\u2018's step-brother Mahmud Shah had Zaman blinded, however not killed.{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=16}} After coming to power in 1803, Shuja\u2018 ended the [[blood feud]] with the powerful [[Barakzai]] family and also forgave them. To create an alliance with them, he married their \"sister\" Wafa Begum.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=23}}\n\nShuja\u2018 allied Afghanistan with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1809, as a means of defending against an invasion of Afghanistan and [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]] by France.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=7}} In 1809, a British diplomatic mission was sent to Afghanistan, which at the time was to the British a remote and mysterious part of Asia. According to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], \"The King of Kabul [Shah Shuja] was a handsome man\". He also wrote \"of an olive complexion with a thick black beard ... his voice clear, his address princely.\" Shuja\u2018 wore the [[Koh-i-Noor]] (\"Mountain of Light\") diamond in one of his bracelets when Elphinstone visited him, but rather undiplomatically described Shuja as having a \"vulgar nose\".{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=6}} [[William Fraser (British India civil servant)|William Fraser]], who accompanied Elphinstone to meet Shah Shuja\u2018 was \"struck with the dignity of his appearance and the romantic Oriental awe.\"{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=20}} Fraser also judged him to be \"about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} tall\" and his skin colour was \"very fair, but dead...his beard was thick jet black and shortened a little by the obliquely upwards, but turned again at the corners ... The eyelashes and the edges of his eyelids were blackened with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|antimony]].\" He also described Shuja's voice as \"loud and sonorous\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Order of the Durrani Empire Afghanistan received by Sir Thomas Willshire 1789 1862.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Order of the Durrani Empire]], founded by Shuja\u2018 Shah in 1839. It was awarded to a number of officers of the [[Bengal Army]]. [[Mus\u00e9e national de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie]].]]\nIn June 1809,{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=27}} he was overthrown by his predecessor [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]] and went into exile in [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]], where he was captured by Jahandad Khan Bamizai and imprisoned at [[Attock]] (1811\u20131812) and then taken to [[Kashmir]] (1812\u20131813) by Atta Muhammad Khan. When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan (vizier)|Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja\u2018 was imprisoned and forced to give up the Timur Ruby, Koh-i-Noor and the sister diamond dray-i-nur diamond to Ranjit Singh.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=23}}He escaped from Ranjit's detention at the Mubarek Haveli Lahore for Ludhiana and the East India Company.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=25}}\n\nFrom 1818 onward, Shuja\u2018 who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Ludhiana where he was joined by Zeman Shah in 1821. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana was occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there used to be a white marble stone commemorating his stay there. {{sfn |Husain|2018|p=386}}\n\n=== Exile ===\nDuring his time in exile, Shuja indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja's court in exile he noted that all of Shuja's courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an \"earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja's grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on \"the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor\", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that \"years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break \"into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul\" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with \"Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hoisted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the \"legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices\", but rather as \"a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nIn 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Restoration of power ===\nIn 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan.

If the show was made by a more brave company they would probably be openly H O M O.\n\n==Premise==\nThe original ''Osomatsu-kun'' series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. ''Mr. Osomatsu'' depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy [[NEET]]s, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Osomatsu-kun#Characters|l1=Characters in Osomatsu-kun}}\n===Matsuno siblings===\n\n[[File:Osomatsu Matsuno siblings.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Matsuno siblings as depicted in Mr. Osomatsu.
