Williams often provides additional vocals on records as well as appears in [[music videos]], unlike Hugo, who tends to stay behind the scenes.\n\nThe Neptunes are considered one of the most successful producers in music history, noted by twenty-four [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 10 hits during the late 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://panachereport.com/channels/hip%20hop%20gallery/2006RichestInHip-Hop.htm |title=Panache Report |publisher=Panache Report |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> In 2009, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked The Neptunes number one on their list of the top 10 producers of the decade.<ref>|title=Billboard's Top 10 Producers Of The Decade &#124; RealTalkNY |publisher=Realtalkny.uproxx.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2011</ref> \nIn 2019, The Neptunes were nominated to the Songwriters Hall of Fame as a part of the 2020 class.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8542745/songwriters-hall-of-fame-nominated-neptunes-outkast-rem</ref>\n\n== History ==\nWilliams and Hugo met at a summer camp for the school of The Gifted and Talented in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], where Williams was a drummer and Hugo played tenor saxophone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72pQQl7dSE4|title=Pharrell Williams on meeting his Neptunes partner Chad Hugo|last=CBS Sunday Morning|date=13 April 2014}}</ref> They were also both members of a [[marching band]];  Williams played [[snare drum]] and Hugo was a student [[conducting|conductor]]. In 1990, Williams and Hugo formed a 4-piece \"R&B type\" group along with friends [[Shay Haley|Shay]] and Mike Etheridge, which they named The Neptunes. Upon entering a local talent contest, they were discovered by [[Teddy Riley (new jack swing)|Teddy Riley]], whose studio was close to Williams' school.<ref name=yolk>\"[http://www.yolk.com/v092/chadhugo1.html Chad Hugo: Rock Star] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508073207/http://www.yolk.com/v092/chadhugo1.html |date=May 8, 2006 }}, an interview with [[Yolk magazine|Yolk Magazine]], 2002</ref>  After graduating from high school, they signed with Riley as a group.<ref name=hhg>\"[http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=neptunes Neptunes production techniques; an interview with Chad Hugo]\" on hiphopgame.com, from the December 2003 issue of 'Sound & Recording'</ref>\n\nThrough working with Riley, Williams went on to write a verse for [[Wreckx-N-Effect]]'s 1992 song \"[[Rump Shaker (song)|Rump Shaker]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 1994, Williams and Hugo had established themselves formally as a production duo under the previously used name The Neptunes, and assistant-produced \"Tonight's The Night\" from Teddy Riley's group [[BLACKstreet]]'s [[Blackstreet (album)|self-titled debut]]. Over the next three years they continued to produce occasionally. Some of the production, such as for [[New Beginning (SWV album)|SWV]] (1996) and [[Total (Total album)|Total]] (1996), had little resemblance to what would become their distinctive sound, while other songs such as [[Mase]]'s 1998 song \"[[Lookin' at Me]]\" (from the ''Harlem World'' album, 1997) showed clear signs the Neptunes sound was developing.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nTheir first major production hit, and the most clear beginning of the distinctive Neptunes sound, came with [[N.O.R.E.]]'s \"[[Superthug]]\" in 1998, reaching #36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and gaining them widespread attention for the first time.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The duo then went on to work heavily with [[Kelis]], producing her first album ''[[Kaleidoscope (Kelis album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' which was the duo's first full album production and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s record \"[[Got Your Money]]\", on which Kelis is featured. They achieved huge commercial success with tracks like [[Jay-Z]]'s \"[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]\", [[Mystikal]]'s \"[[Shake Ya Ass]]\", and then-newly renamed [[Sean Combs|Diddy]]'s single \"D.I.D.D.Y\". Other notable hits during their commercial rise were [[Busta Rhymes]]' \"[[Pass the Courvoisier, Part II]]\u201d, [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s \"[[U Don't Have to Call]]\" and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]\u2019s \u201c[[Candy (Foxy Brown song)|Candy]]\u201d.\n\n[[Kelis]] was one of several artists whose careers Hugo and Williams have helped launch; artists such as the [[Clipse]], Vanessa Marquez and [[Justin Timberlake]]'s solo career were also closely tied to the Neptunes' involvement. They have also helped re-launch the careers of [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Robin Thicke]] and [[Mystikal]].\n\nIn 2001, The Neptunes gained their first worldwide hit with [[Britney Spears]]' single, \"[[I'm A Slave 4 U]]\", which reached number one in several countries in Europe and South America. The following year they reached number one in the U.S. with [[Nelly]]'s single, \"[[Hot in Herre]]\". In August of the same year, The Neptunes were named \"Producers of the Year\" at both [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] Awards and the [[Billboard Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2003, they released a self-credited album called ''[[The Neptunes Present... Clones]]'', featuring songs and remixes from various [[Star Trak]] artists. This album topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Albums Chart.\n\nThe Neptunes won [[Grammy Awards]] in 2004, one for \"Producer of the Year, Non-Classical\", and another for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" for their work on Justin Timberlake's debut studio album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]''. They also gained their first UK number one, again with [[Nelly]], and \"[[Flap Your Wings (song)|Flap Your Wings]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n<!--== Musical style ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n=== Drums ===\nA Neptunes production is typically characterized by flat, punchy drum machine sounds and the use of module presets.{{according to whom}} \"[[Grindin']]\" was a drum track that paid tribute to [[Eric B. & Rakim]]'s song of the same nature, \"My Melody\".{{citation needed}} [[Justin Timberlake]]'s \"Like I Love You\" paid tribute to the drums of the funk era, where the loop consisted of various snare sounds.{{citation needed}} On [[Busta Rhymes]]' \"Light Yo Ass On Fire\" they used a heavy chorus effect on the rhythm track suggesting an industrial or robotic theme.{{citation needed}} They have used the popular [[Roland TR-808]] drum sound on such songs as [[LL Cool J]]'s and [[Jamie Foxx]]'s collaboration \"Best Dress\" but later production work introduced live drum sounds similar to the ones they would frequently use under their [[N.E.R.D]] guise. Both The Neptunes and Williams as a solo producer are well known for their extensive use of percussion other than drums.{{according to whom}} Examples of Williams' use of percussion are in [[Robin Thicke]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Blurred Lines]]\" on which he is featured with rapper [[T.I.]], and also ''[[Get Like Me (Nelly song)|Get Like Me]]'' by [[Nelly]], which featured [[Nicki Minaj]] and himself.\n\nThe Neptunes' engineer, in an interview with Sound on Sound magazine, revealed many of their production techniques.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Daley |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul05/articles/andrewcoleman.htm |title=Recording The Neptunes |publisher=Soundonsound.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> In reference to their drums he said, \"Williams will play a standard drum kit, then I will cut 16 bars of it into a loop, before using the same method for other instruments including guitars. That's where a lot of the feel of their records comes from \u2014 it's not just machines and loops.\"<ref>Sound on Sound \"[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul05/articles/andrewcoleman.htm Recording the Neptunes]\", July 2005</ref>\n\n=== Vocals ===\nMany Neptunes productions feature a hook with Pharrell singing [[falsetto]], including Jay-Z's \"[[Excuse Me Miss]]\", Jadakiss' \"Hot Sauce To Go\", Kelis' \"Flashback\", and Snoop Dogg's \"[[Beautiful (Snoop Dogg song)|Beautiful]]\". Pharrell also adds his own rhymes to his productions, including \"[[Drop It Like It's Hot]]\" in 2004 and \"[[Can I Have It Like That]]\" from his solo debut album [[In My Mind (Pharrell album)|''In My Mind'']]. Sometimes he is credited as a featured artist.\n\n=== Synthesizers ===\nAnother sound found on Neptunes productions are their distinctive use of synth lines (popularized by [[Dr. Dre]] in the early 1990s with his [[G-funk]] subgenre). Examples include the sharp unfiltered [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] bass on [[Busta Rhymes]]' [[As I Come Back]] or [[Kelis]]' [[Milkshake (song)|Milkshake]], the heavily [[Phaser (effect)|phased]] strings in Jay-Z's \"[[La-La-La (Excuse Me Miss Again)]]\", and hard clavi sounds which are used in [[N.E.R.D]]'s \"Lapdance\", reminiscent of those associated with [[rayguns]] or video game sound effects from the [[8-bit]] era. The synthesizers they use include a [[MicroKorg]], and a [[Minimoog Voyager]].\n\n=== Studio equipment ===\nThere has been much speculation about their tools of the trade. For sequencing they use the [[Korg]] 01/W, for drum sounds they use the sampling keyboard [[Ensoniq ASR-10]], their sound modules include the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]  JV 1080 and JV 2080 and for basslines and filtering they have used the [[MicroKorg]]. They are also well known for using the Korg Triton and incorporating live percussion and acoustic instruments into their music.<ref name=\"hhg\"/> -->\n== Other ventures ==\n=== Star Trak ===\nThe Neptunes' record label, [[Star Trak Entertainment]], includes acts such as [[Clipse]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Slim Thug]] and [[Robin Thicke]]. Star Trak artists generally benefit from more frequent production from The Neptunes, however, criticisms include poor promotion and release scheduling. Former artists include (due to parent label disputes) [[Kelis]].\n\n=== N.E.R.D ===\nThe alternative group [[N.E.R.D]] is composed of Williams, Hugo and Shay Haley. It is a [[backronym]]{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} of '''''N'''o One '''E'''ver '''R'''eally '''D'''ies''. Their group hits include \"[[Lapdance (song)|Lapdance]]\", \"[[Rock Star (N.E.R.D song)|Rock Star]]\" and \"[[She Wants To Move]]\". The first two singles came from their debut album ''[[In Search Of... (N.E.R.D album)|In Search Of...]]'' released in 2001, while the latter came from their eagerly anticipated follow-up ''[[Fly Or Die]]'' in 2004. The band released a third album, ''[[Seeing Sounds]]'', on June 10, 2008 and released their fourth studio album, ''[[Nothing (N.E.R.D album)|Nothing]]'', on November 2, 2010. They released their latest album, ''[[No One Ever Really Dies]]'' in 2017.\n\n=== Williams as a solo artist ===\nIn 2003, Williams released his first solo single, \"[[Frontin']]\" featuring Jay-Z. At the time he claimed it was a one-off song, and that he was not a singer in his own right. However, after several delays, Pharrell released his debut solo album on July 24<!-- the album was first released to the public, on July 24 - https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BPN2CC/qid=1156255534/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/026-3198886-8354834 fact that it was released a day later in the US is irrelevant-->, 2006, titled ''[[In My Mind (Pharrell album)|In My Mind]]''. The first single from the album was a collaboration with [[Gwen Stefani]] titled \"[[Can I Have It Like That]]\", released in 2005. The album featured numerous guests, including [[Jay-Z]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Nelly]], [[Slim Thug]], and [[Kanye West]]. In 2014, he released his second album ''[[Girl (Pharrell Williams album)|G I R L]]'', which featured the hit single \"[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]\".\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|The Neptunes production discography}}\n\n=== Albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"| [[Billboard 200|U.S.]]<br /><ref name=\"BB-Clones\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the neptunes|chart=all}} |title=The Neptunes Present...

Williams often provides additional vocals on records as well as appears in [[music videos]], unlike Hugo, who tends to stay behind the scenes.\n\nThe Neptunes are considered one of the most successful producers in music history, noted by twenty-four [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 10 hits during the late 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://panachereport.com/channels/hip%20hop%20gallery/2006RichestInHip-Hop.htm |title=Panache Report |publisher=Panache Report |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> In 2009, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked The Neptunes number one on their list of the top 10 producers of the decade.<ref>|title=Billboard's Top 10 Producers Of The Decade &#124; RealTalkNY |publisher=Realtalkny.uproxx.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2011</ref> \nIn 2019, The Neptunes were nominated to the Songwriters Hall of Fame as a part of the 2020 class.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8542745/songwriters-hall-of-fame-nominated-neptunes-outkast-rem</ref>\n\n== History ==\nWilliams and Hugo met at a summer camp for the school of The Gifted and Talented in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], where Williams was a drummer and Hugo played tenor saxophone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72pQQl7dSE4|title=Pharrell Williams on meeting his Neptunes partner Chad Hugo|last=CBS Sunday Morning|date=13 April 2014}}</ref> They were also both members of a [[marching band]];  Williams played [[snare drum]] and Hugo was a student [[conducting|conductor]]. In 1990, Williams and Hugo formed a 4-piece \"R&B type\" group along with friends [[Shay Haley|Shay]] and Mike Etheridge, which they named The Neptunes. Upon entering a local talent contest, they were discovered by [[Teddy Riley (new jack swing)|Teddy Riley]], whose studio was close to Williams' school.<ref name=yolk>\"[http://www.yolk.com/v092/chadhugo1.html Chad Hugo: Rock Star] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508073207/http://www.yolk.com/v092/chadhugo1.html |date=May 8, 2006 }}, an interview with [[Yolk magazine|Yolk Magazine]], 2002</ref>  After graduating from high school, they signed with Riley as a group.<ref name=hhg>\"[http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=neptunes Neptunes production techniques; an interview with Chad Hugo]\" on hiphopgame.com, from the December 2003 issue of 'Sound & Recording'</ref>\n\nThrough working with Riley, Williams went on to write a verse for [[Wreckx-N-Effect]]'s 1992 song \"[[Rump Shaker (song)|Rump Shaker]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 1994, Williams and Hugo had established themselves formally as a production duo under the previously used name The Neptunes, and assistant-produced \"Tonight's The Night\" from Teddy Riley's group [[BLACKstreet]]'s [[Blackstreet (album)|self-titled debut]]. Over the next three years they continued to produce occasionally. Some of the production, such as for [[New Beginning (SWV album)|SWV]] (1996) and [[Total (Total album)|Total]] (1996), had little resemblance to what would become their distinctive sound, while other songs such as [[Mase]]'s 1998 song \"[[Lookin' at Me]]\" (from the ''Harlem World'' album, 1997) showed clear signs the Neptunes sound was developing.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nTheir first major production hit, and the most clear beginning of the distinctive Neptunes sound, came with [[N.O.R.E.]]'s \"[[Superthug]]\" in 1998, reaching #36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and gaining them widespread attention for the first time.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} The duo then went on to work heavily with [[Kelis]], producing her first album ''[[Kaleidoscope (Kelis album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' which was the duo's first full album production and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s record \"[[Got Your Money]]\", on which Kelis is featured. They achieved huge commercial success with tracks like [[Jay-Z]]'s \"[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]\", [[Mystikal]]'s \"[[Shake Ya Ass]]\", and then-newly renamed [[Sean Combs|Diddy]]'s single \"D.I.D.D.Y\". Other notable hits during their commercial rise were [[Busta Rhymes]]' \"[[Pass the Courvoisier, Part II]]\u201d, [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s \"[[U Don't Have to Call]]\" and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]\u2019s \u201c[[Candy (Foxy Brown song)|Candy]]\u201d.\n\n[[Kelis]] was one of several artists whose careers Hugo and Williams have helped launch; artists such as the [[Clipse]], Vanessa Marquez and [[Justin Timberlake]]'s solo career were also closely tied to the Neptunes' involvement. They have also helped re-launch the careers of [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Robin Thicke]] and [[Mystikal]].\n\nIn 2001, The Neptunes gained their first worldwide hit with [[Britney Spears]]' single, \"[[I'm A Slave 4 U]]\", which reached number one in several countries in Europe and South America. The following year they reached number one in the U.S. with [[Nelly]]'s single, \"[[Hot in Herre]]\". In August of the same year, The Neptunes were named \"Producers of the Year\" at both [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] Awards and the [[Billboard Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2003, they released a self-credited album called ''[[The Neptunes Present... Clones]]'', featuring songs and remixes from various [[Star Trak]] artists. This album topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Albums Chart.\n\nThe Neptunes won [[Grammy Awards]] in 2004, one for \"Producer of the Year, Non-Classical\", and another for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" for their work on Justin Timberlake's debut studio album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]''. They also gained their first UK number one, again with [[Nelly]], and \"[[Flap Your Wings (song)|Flap Your Wings]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n<!--== Musical style ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n=== Drums ===\nA Neptunes production is typically characterized by flat, punchy drum machine sounds and the use of module presets.{{according to whom}} \"[[Grindin']]\" was a drum track that paid tribute to [[Eric B. & Rakim]]'s song of the same nature, \"My Melody\".{{citation needed}} [[Justin Timberlake]]'s \"Like I Love You\" paid tribute to the drums of the funk era, where the loop consisted of various snare sounds.{{citation needed}} On [[Busta Rhymes]]' \"Light Yo Ass On Fire\" they used a heavy chorus effect on the rhythm track suggesting an industrial or robotic theme.{{citation needed}} They have used the popular [[Roland TR-808]] drum sound on such songs as [[LL Cool J]]'s and [[Jamie Foxx]]'s collaboration \"Best Dress\" but later production work introduced live drum sounds similar to the ones they would frequently use under their [[N.E.R.D]] guise. Both The Neptunes and Williams as a solo producer are well known for their extensive use of percussion other than drums.{{according to whom}} Examples of Williams' use of percussion are in [[Robin Thicke]]'s 2013 hit \"[[Blurred Lines]]\" on which he is featured with rapper [[T.I.]], and also ''[[Get Like Me (Nelly song)|Get Like Me]]'' by [[Nelly]], which featured [[Nicki Minaj]] and himself.\n\nThe Neptunes' engineer, in an interview with Sound on Sound magazine, revealed many of their production techniques.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Daley |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul05/articles/andrewcoleman.htm |title=Recording The Neptunes |publisher=Soundonsound.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> In reference to their drums he said, \"Williams will play a standard drum kit, then I will cut 16 bars of it into a loop, before using the same method for other instruments including guitars. That's where a lot of the feel of their records comes from \u2014 it's not just machines and loops.\"<ref>Sound on Sound \"[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul05/articles/andrewcoleman.htm Recording the Neptunes]\", July 2005</ref>\n\n=== Vocals ===\nMany Neptunes productions feature a hook with Pharrell singing [[falsetto]], including Jay-Z's \"[[Excuse Me Miss]]\", Jadakiss' \"Hot Sauce To Go\", Kelis' \"Flashback\", and Snoop Dogg's \"[[Beautiful (Snoop Dogg song)|Beautiful]]\". Pharrell also adds his own rhymes to his productions, including \"[[Drop It Like It's Hot]]\" in 2004 and \"[[Can I Have It Like That]]\" from his solo debut album [[In My Mind (Pharrell album)|''In My Mind'']]. Sometimes he is credited as a featured artist.\n\n=== Synthesizers ===\nAnother sound found on Neptunes productions are their distinctive use of synth lines (popularized by [[Dr. Dre]] in the early 1990s with his [[G-funk]] subgenre). Examples include the sharp unfiltered [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] bass on [[Busta Rhymes]]' [[As I Come Back]] or [[Kelis]]' [[Milkshake (song)|Milkshake]], the heavily [[Phaser (effect)|phased]] strings in Jay-Z's \"[[La-La-La (Excuse Me Miss Again)]]\", and hard clavi sounds which are used in [[N.E.R.D]]'s \"Lapdance\", reminiscent of those associated with [[rayguns]] or video game sound effects from the [[8-bit]] era. The synthesizers they use include a [[MicroKorg]], and a [[Minimoog Voyager]].\n\n=== Studio equipment ===\nThere has been much speculation about their tools of the trade. For sequencing they use the [[Korg]] 01/W, for drum sounds they use the sampling keyboard [[Ensoniq ASR-10]], their sound modules include the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]  JV 1080 and JV 2080 and for basslines and filtering they have used the [[MicroKorg]]. They are also well known for using the Korg Triton and incorporating live percussion and acoustic instruments into their music.<ref name=\"hhg\"/> -->\n== Other ventures ==\n=== Star Trak ===\nThe Neptunes' record label, [[Star Trak Entertainment]], includes acts such as [[Clipse]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Slim Thug]] and [[Robin Thicke]]. Star Trak artists generally benefit from more frequent production from The Neptunes, however, criticisms include poor promotion and release scheduling. Former artists include (due to parent label disputes) [[Kelis]].\n\n=== N.E.R.D ===\nThe alternative group [[N.E.R.D]] is composed of Williams, Hugo and Shay Haley. It is a [[backronym]]{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} of '''''N'''o One '''E'''ver '''R'''eally '''D'''ies''. Their group hits include \"[[Lapdance (song)|Lapdance]]\", \"[[Rock Star (N.E.R.D song)|Rock Star]]\" and \"[[She Wants To Move]]\". The first two singles came from their debut album ''[[In Search Of... (N.E.R.D album)|In Search Of...]]'' released in 2001, while the latter came from their eagerly anticipated follow-up ''[[Fly Or Die]]'' in 2004. The band released a third album, ''[[Seeing Sounds]]'', on June 10, 2008 and released their fourth studio album, ''[[Nothing (N.E.R.D album)|Nothing]]'', on November 2, 2010. They released their latest album, ''[[No One Ever Really Dies]]'' in 2017.\n\n=== Williams as a solo artist ===\nIn 2003, Williams released his first solo single, \"[[Frontin']]\" featuring Jay-Z. At the time he claimed it was a one-off song, and that he was not a singer in his own right. However, after several delays, Pharrell released his debut solo album on July 24<!-- the album was first released to the public, on July 24 - https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BPN2CC/qid=1156255534/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/026-3198886-8354834 fact that it was released a day later in the US is irrelevant-->, 2006, titled ''[[In My Mind (Pharrell album)|In My Mind]]''. The first single from the album was a collaboration with [[Gwen Stefani]] titled \"[[Can I Have It Like That]]\", released in 2005. The album featured numerous guests, including [[Jay-Z]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Nelly]], [[Slim Thug]], and [[Kanye West]]. In 2014, he released his second album ''[[Girl (Pharrell Williams album)|G I R L]]'', which featured the hit single \"[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]\".\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|The Neptunes production discography}}\n\n=== Albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"| [[Billboard 200|U.S.]]<br /><ref name=\"BB-Clones\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the neptunes|chart=all}} |title=The Neptunes Present...

At the beginning of the war the Government, underestimating the value of strong younger coal miners, conscripted them into the armed forces. By mid-1943 the coal mines had lost 36,000&nbsp;workers, and they were generally not replaced, because other likely young men were also being conscripted to the armed forces. The government made a plea to men liable to conscription, asking them to volunteer to work in the mines, instead, but few responded, and the manpower shortage continued.\n\nBy October 1943 Britain was becoming desperate for a continued supply of coal, both for the industrial war effort and for keeping homes warm throughout the winter. On 12 October [[Gwilym Lloyd George]], [[Minister of Fuel and Power]], announced in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that some conscripts would be directed to the mines. On 2 December Ernest Bevin explained the scheme in more detail in parliament, announcing his intention to draft 30,000 men aged 18 to 25 by 30 April 1944.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Young men for the mines |date= 3 December 1943 |page_number= 4 |issue= 49719}}</ref> The colloquial name \"Bevin Boys\" came from a further speech Bevin made:\n\n''{{quote|We need 720,000 men continuously employed in this industry. This is where you boys come in. Our fighting men will not be able to achieve their purpose unless we get an adequate supply of coal.}}''\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945 one in ten of young men called up was sent to work in the mines. This caused a deal of upset, as many young men wanted to join the fighting forces and felt that as miners they would not be valued. Many Bevin Boys suffered taunts as they wore no uniform, and there were accusations by some people that they were deliberately avoiding military conscription.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Programme==\n\n===Selection of conscripts===\nTo make the process random, one of Bevin's secretaries each week, from 14 December 1943, pulled a digit from a hat containing all ten digits, 0\u20139, and all men liable for call-up that week whose National Service registration number ended in that digit were directed to work in the mines, with the exception of any selected for highly skilled war work such as flying planes and in submarines, and men found physically unfit for mining. Conscripted miners came from many different trades and professions, from desk work to heavy manual labour, and included some who might otherwise have become [[commissioned officer]]s.\n\n===Working conditions===\n[[File:Bevin Boy- Mining Training at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945 D23732.jpg|thumb|A classroom lecture where Bevin Boys are learning about the [[Davy lamp]] at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, in February 1945]]\nBoys when they were nearly 18 years old received an official [[postcard]] instructing them in five days time to report to a training centre such as at [[Cresswell, Derbyshire|Cresswell Colliery]], Derbyshire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interview 29 August 2019 with ex-Bevin Boy Kenneth Jones born 1926.</ref>\n\nThe Bevin Boys were first given six weeks' training (four off-site, two on). The work was typical coal mining, largely a mile or more down dark, dank tunnels, and conscripts were supplied with helmets and steel-capped safety boots. Bevin Boys did not wear uniforms or badges, but the oldest clothes they could find. Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.<ref>Called Up Sent Down : The Bevin Boys' War \u2013 Tom Hickman Pub. The History Press 2008 {{ISBN|0-7509-4547-8}}</ref>\n\nSince a number of [[conscientious objectors]] were sent to work down the mines as an alternative to military service (under a system wholly separate from the Bevin Boy programme), there was sometimes an assumption that Bevin Boys were \"Conchies\". The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War. However, old attitudes still prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys. In 1943 Ernest Bevin said in Parliament: \"There are thousands of cases in which conscientious objectors, although they may have refused to take up arms, have shown as much courage as anyone else in Civil Defence.\"<ref>[http://www.ppu.org.uk/century/century5.html 1940\u20131949 Candles in the Dark <!--Wrong title: The Peace Movement 1940\u201349-->], Peace Pledge Union</ref>\n\n==End of programme==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Bevin Boy Veteran badge, awarded to former Bevin Boys by the British Government since 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-bevin-boys/|title=5 things you (probably) didn\u2019t know about the Bevin Boys |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>{{ffdc|Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|log=2020 April 5}}]] -->\n\nUnlike war-service veterans, Bevin Boys received neither [[medal]]s nor the right to return to the jobs they had previously held, although they were entitled to the Government's Further Education and Training Scheme (FETS); which was also available for war-service veterans.

At the beginning of the war the Government, underestimating the value of strong younger coal miners, conscripted them into the armed forces. By mid-1943 the coal mines had lost 36,000&nbsp;workers, and they were generally not replaced, because other likely young men were also being conscripted to the armed forces. The government made a plea to men liable to conscription, asking them to volunteer to work in the mines, instead, but few responded, and the manpower shortage continued.\n\nBy October 1943 Britain was becoming desperate for a continued supply of coal, both for the industrial war effort and for keeping homes warm throughout the winter. On 12 October [[Gwilym Lloyd George]], [[Minister of Fuel and Power]], announced in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that some conscripts would be directed to the mines. On 2 December Ernest Bevin explained the scheme in more detail in parliament, announcing his intention to draft 30,000 men aged 18 to 25 by 30 April 1944.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Young men for the mines |date= 3 December 1943 |page_number= 4 |issue= 49719}}</ref> The colloquial name \"Bevin Boys\" came from a further speech Bevin made:\n\n''{{quote|We need 720,000 men continuously employed in this industry. This is where you boys come in. Our fighting men will not be able to achieve their purpose unless we get an adequate supply of coal.}}''\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945 one in ten of young men called up was sent to work in the mines. This caused a deal of upset, as many young men wanted to join the fighting forces and felt that as miners they would not be valued. Many Bevin Boys suffered taunts as they wore no uniform, and there were accusations by some people that they were deliberately avoiding military conscription.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Programme==\n\n===Selection of conscripts===\nTo make the process random, one of Bevin's secretaries each week, from 14 December 1943, pulled a digit from a hat containing all ten digits, 0\u20139, and all men liable for call-up that week whose National Service registration number ended in that digit were directed to work in the mines, with the exception of any selected for highly skilled war work such as flying planes and in submarines, and men found physically unfit for mining. Conscripted miners came from many different trades and professions, from desk work to heavy manual labour, and included some who might otherwise have become [[commissioned officer]]s.\n\n===Working conditions===\n[[File:Bevin Boy- Mining Training at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945 D23732.jpg|thumb|A classroom lecture where Bevin Boys are learning about the [[Davy lamp]] at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, in February 1945]]\nBoys when they were nearly 18 years old received an official [[postcard]] instructing them in five days time to report to a training centre such as at [[Cresswell, Derbyshire|Cresswell Colliery]], Derbyshire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interview 29 August 2019 with ex-Bevin Boy Kenneth Jones born 1926.</ref>\n\nThe Bevin Boys were first given six weeks' training (four off-site, two on). The work was typical coal mining, largely a mile or more down dark, dank tunnels, and conscripts were supplied with helmets and steel-capped safety boots. Bevin Boys did not wear uniforms or badges, but the oldest clothes they could find. Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.<ref>Called Up Sent Down : The Bevin Boys' War \u2013 Tom Hickman Pub. The History Press 2008 {{ISBN|0-7509-4547-8}}</ref>\n\nSince a number of [[conscientious objectors]] were sent to work down the mines as an alternative to military service (under a system wholly separate from the Bevin Boy programme), there was sometimes an assumption that Bevin Boys were \"Conchies\". The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War. However, old attitudes still prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys. In 1943 Ernest Bevin said in Parliament: \"There are thousands of cases in which conscientious objectors, although they may have refused to take up arms, have shown as much courage as anyone else in Civil Defence.\"<ref>[http://www.ppu.org.uk/century/century5.html 1940\u20131949 Candles in the Dark <!--Wrong title: The Peace Movement 1940\u201349-->], Peace Pledge Union</ref>\n\n==End of programme==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Bevin Boy Veteran badge, awarded to former Bevin Boys by the British Government since 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-bevin-boys/|title=5 things you (probably) didn\u2019t know about the Bevin Boys |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>{{ffdc|Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|log=2020 April 5}}]] -->\n\nUnlike war-service veterans, Bevin Boys received neither [[medal]]s nor the right to return to the jobs they had previously held, although they were entitled to the Government's Further Education and Training Scheme (FETS); which was also available for war-service veterans.

During [[World War II]], [[Joseph Stalin]] was forced to move his [[biological warfare]] (BW) operations out of the path of advancing German forces and may have used [[tularemia]] against German troops in 1942 near [[Stalingrad]].\n\nBy 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union. Although the USSR also signed the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC), the Soviets subsequently augmented their biowarfare programs. Over the course of its history, the Soviet program is known to have weaponized and stockpiled the following eleven [[bio-agent]]s<ref>Cook, Michelle Stem and Amy F. Woolf (April 10, 2002), [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/crs/RL31368.pdf ''Preventing Proliferation of Biological Weapons: U.S. Assistance to the Former Soviet States''], (Congressional Research Service Report for Congress), pg 3.</ref> (and to have pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' ([[Plague (disease)|plague]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'' ([[glanders]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]] (VEE)\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\n*[[Smallpox]]\n*[[Marburg virus]]\n\nThese programs became immense and were conducted at 52 clandestine sites employing over 50,000 people. Annualized production capacity for weaponized [[smallpox]], for example, was 90 to 100 tons. In the 1980s and 1990s, many of these agents were genetically altered to resist heat, cold, and antibiotics. In the 1990s, [[Boris Yeltsin]] admitted to an offensive bio-weapons program as well as to the true nature of the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|Sverdlovsk biological weapons accident]] of 1979, which had resulted in the deaths of at least 64 people. Defecting Soviet bioweaponeers such as  Colonel [[Kanatjan Alibekov]] confirmed that the program had been massive and still existed. An agreement was signed with the US and UK promising to end bio-weapons programs and convert BW facilities to benevolent purposes, but compliance with the agreement \u2014 and the fate of the former Soviet bio-agents and facilities \u2014 is still mostly undocumented.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-World War II===\nThe Soviet BW program began in the 1920s at the [[Leningrad Military Academy]] under the control of the state security apparatus, known as the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]]. This occurred despite the fact that the USSR was a signatory to the [[Geneva Protocol|1925 Geneva Convention]], which banned both chemical and biological weapons.<ref>Martin, James W., George W.

''Military Medicine'' 166.10 (October 2001)</ref>\n\nTularemia was allegedly used against German troops in 1942 near Stalingrad.<ref name=\"Alibek\"/> Around 10,000 cases of tularemia had been reported in the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1943. However, the number of cases jumped to more than 100,000 in the year of the Stalingrad outbreak. German [[Panzer]] troops fell ill in such significant numbers during the late summer of 1942 that the German military campaign came to a temporary halt. German soldiers became ill with the rare pulmonary form of tularemia, which may indicate the use of an aerosol biological weapon (the ordinary transmission pathway is through [[ticks]] and [[rodents]]). According to [[Kenneth Alibek]], the used tularemia weapon had been developed in the [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] military facility.<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>  It was suggested by some, however, that the outbreak might have been of natural origin, since a pulmonary form of tularemia has also been noted in natural outbreaks in [[Martha's Vineyard]] in 2000.<ref name=\"Eric Croddy 2001\"/>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the outbreak at Stalingrad was described as a natural outbreak.  Crops were left in the field during the German offensive and the rodent population swelled, putting many inhabitants into contact with infected rodents.  In some parts of the Stalingrad Oblast, as many as 75% of the inhabitants became infected.  It was also noted that before the war, there was a so-called \"threshing tularemia\", caused by people inhaling infected dusts soiled by rodents while threshing grain.<ref>Yelkin, I. I.

Emboldened by these discoveries, Stalin put [[KGB]] chief [[Lavrenty Beria]] in charge of a new BW program.\n\n===The Cold War===\n1946: A biological weapons facility was established in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]].\n\nThe first [[smallpox]] weapons factory in the Soviet Union was established in 1947 in the city of [[Zagorsk]], close to Moscow.<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>  It was produced by injecting small amounts of the virus into chicken eggs. An especially virulent strain (codenamed India-1967 or India-1) was brought from India in 1967 by a special Soviet medical team that was sent to India to help eradicate the virus. The pathogen was manufactured and stockpiled in large quantities throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n1953: The fifteenth directorate of the Red Army takes responsibility for the program.\n\nBy 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union. Although the USSR also signed the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC), the Soviets subsequently augmented their biowarfare programs. They doubted the United States\u2019 claimed compliance with the BWC, which further motivated their program.<ref>Alibek, ''Op. cit.''</ref> The Soviet BW effort became a huge program, comprising various institutions under different ministries along with commercial facilities and collectively known as [[Biopreparat]] after 1973. Biopreparat pursued offensive research, development, and production of [[biological agents]] under the guise of legitimate civil biotechnology research. It conducted its clandestine activities at 52 sites and employed over 50,000 people. Annualized production capacity for weaponized smallpox, rabies, and typhus, for example, was 90 to 100 tons.<ref>B. Beckett  (1983), ''Weapons of Tomorrow'', New York, NY: [[Plenum Press]].</ref>\n\n1973: A \"civilian\" main directorate [[Biopreparat]] was founded. Other organizations involved in the design and production of biological weapons were the Soviet [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], [[Ministry of Agriculture (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Agriculture]], [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Health]], [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], and [[KGB]].

Suddenly, I was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in [[Aralsk]]. A research ship of the Aral fleet had come within 15 km from the island (it was forbidden to come any closer than 40 km). The lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck.

After returning home to Aralsk, she infected several people, including children. All of them died. I suspected the reason for this and called the General Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Defense and requested to forbid the [[Alma-Ata]] train from stopping in Aralsk. As a result, an epidemic throughout the country was prevented. I called [[Yuri Andropov|Andropov]], who at that time was the Chief of the KGB, and informed him of the unique formulation of smallpox obtained on [[Vozrozhdeniya Island]].\u201d<ref name=\"Shoham\">{{cite journal |author=Shoham D, Wolfson Z |title=The Russian biological weapons program: vanished or disappeared? |journal=Crit.

An especially virulent strain (codenamed India-1967 or India-1) was brought from India in 1967 by a special Soviet medical team that was sent to India to help eradicate the virus. The pathogen was manufactured and stockpiled in large quantities throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n1953: The fifteenth directorate of the Red Army takes responsibility for the program.\n\nBy 1960, numerous BW research facilities existed throughout the Soviet Union. Although the USSR also signed the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC), the Soviets subsequently augmented their biowarfare programs. They doubted the United States\u2019 claimed compliance with the BWC, which further motivated their program.<ref>Alibek, ''Op. cit.''</ref> The Soviet BW effort became a huge program, comprising various institutions under different ministries along with commercial facilities and collectively known as [[Biopreparat]] after 1973. Biopreparat pursued offensive research, development, and production of [[biological agents]] under the guise of legitimate civil biotechnology research. It conducted its clandestine activities at 52 sites and employed over 50,000 people. Annualized production capacity for weaponized smallpox, rabies, and typhus, for example, was 90 to 100 tons.<ref>B. Beckett  (1983), ''Weapons of Tomorrow'', New York, NY: [[Plenum Press]].</ref>\n\n1973: A \"civilian\" main directorate [[Biopreparat]] was founded. Other organizations involved in the design and production of biological weapons were the Soviet [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], [[Ministry of Agriculture (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Agriculture]], [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Health]], [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], and [[KGB]].

The development and production were conducted by a main directorate (\"[[Biopreparat]]\") along with the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Soviet Ministry of Defense]], the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Food (Soviet Union)|Soviet Ministry of Agriculture]], the [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Soviet Ministry of Health]], the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], the [[KGB]], and other state organizations.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture successfully developed variants of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] and [[rinderpest]] against cows, [[African swine fever]] for pigs, and [[psittacosis]] to kill chicken. These agents were prepared to be sprayed down from tanks attached to airplanes over hundreds of miles. The secret program was code-named \"Ecology\".<ref name=\"Alibek\"/>\n\n===The post-Soviet era===\nIn the 1990s, the [[President of the Russian Federation]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], admitted to an offensive bio-weapons program as well as to the true nature of the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|Sverdlovsk biological weapons accident]] of 1979, which had resulted in the deaths of at least 64 people.<ref>J Miller, S Engelberg, and W Broad (2001), ''Germs: Biological Weapons and America\u2019s Secret War'', New York, NY: [[Simon & Schuster]].</ref>  Soviet defectors, including Colonel [[Kanatjan Alibekov]], the first deputy chief of Biopreparat from 1988 to 1992, confirmed that the program had been massive and that it still existed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perspective, Volume IX, Number 1|url=http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol9/Alibek.html|website=Institute for the Study of Conflict Ideology and Policy|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> In September 1992, Russia signed an agreement with the United States and Great Britain promising to end its bio-weapons program and to convert its facilities for benevolent scientific and medical purposes.<ref>M Leitenberg (2001), ''Working Paper: Biological Weapons in the 20th Century: A Review and Analysis'', College Park, Md: [[Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland]], University of Maryland; 2001.

General Professor Peter Burgasov, former Chief Sanitary Physician of the [[Soviet Army]], and a senior researcher within the program of biological weapons  described this incident:\n:\u201cOn [[Vozrozhdeniya Island]] in the [[Aral Sea]], the strongest formulations of smallpox were tested. Suddenly, I was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in [[Aralsk]]. A research ship of the Aral fleet had come within 15 km from the island (it was forbidden to come any closer than 40 km). The lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck. The smallpox formulation\u2014 400 gr. of which was exploded on the island\u2014\u201dgot her\u201d, and she became infected. After returning home to Aralsk, she infected several people, including children. All of them died. I suspected the reason for this and called the General Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Defense and requested to forbid the [[Alma-Ata]] train from stopping in Aralsk. As a result, an epidemic throughout the country was prevented. I called [[Yuri Andropov|Andropov]], who at that time was the Chief of the KGB, and informed him of the unique formulation of smallpox obtained on [[Vozrozhdeniya Island]].\u201d<ref name=\"Shoham\">{{cite journal |author=Shoham D, Wolfson Z |title=The Russian biological weapons program: vanished or disappeared? |journal=Crit.

Specifically, it includes to all stations that lie in fare zone 1 (except for [[Mets\u2013Willets Point station (LIRR)|Mets\u2013Willets Point]] on the [[Port Washington Branch]]), which is the set of stations west of [[Jamaica station|Jamaica]].\n\n==Routes==\nThere are three routes that are part of the City Terminal Zone:\n* [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]] (NYP) \u2013 Trains that, from Jamaica, travel west along the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] to Penn Station in Manhattan via the [[East River Tunnels]].\n* [[Atlantic Terminal]] (AT) \u2013 Trains that travel along the [[Atlantic Branch]] to Brooklyn.\n* [[Long Island City station|Long Island City]] (LIC) \u2013 Trains that serve [[Hunterspoint Avenue station (LIRR)|Hunterspoint Avenue]] and Long Island City in Queens. These trains also use the Main Line west of Jamaica, but typically skip [[Woodside station (LIRR)|Woodside]], [[Forest Hills station (LIRR)|Forest Hills]], and [[Kew Gardens station (LIRR)|Kew Gardens]]. This route is served only during weekday rush hours in the peak direction (to Long Island City in the morning, from Long Island City in the afternoon).\n\nThe City Terminal Zone formerly included the [[Lower Montauk Branch]] from Long Island City to Jamaica until passenger service on that route was discontinued in November 2012. This line formerly included [[Penny Bridge station|Penny Bridge]], [[Haberman station|Haberman]], [[Fresh Pond station|Fresh Pond]], [[Glendale station (LIRR)|Glendale]], and [[Richmond Hill station (LIRR)|Richmond Hill stations]] until they were closed in March 1998.\n\nThe City Terminal Zone is slated to include a branch to a [[Grand Central LIRR terminal|new station]] underneath [[Grand Central Terminal]] as part of the [[East Side Access]] project. A [[Sunnyside station (LIRR)|new station in Sunnyside, Queens]], is scheduled to be built once the remainder of the project is complete.\n\n==Stations==\nEast of {{lirrs|Jamaica}}, trains continue in Long Island on the Main Line ([[Hempstead Branch|Hempstead]], [[Oyster Bay Branch|Oyster Bay]], [[Port Jefferson Branch|Port Jefferson]], [[Ronkonkoma Branch|Ronkonkoma]]), Atlantic Branch ([[Far Rockaway Branch|Far Rockaway]] and [[Long Beach Branch|Long Beach]]), and Montauk Branch ([[West Hempstead Branch|West Hempstead]], [[Babylon Branch|Babylon]], [[Montauk Branch|Montauk]]).\n\n{|
