It bears the [[nostril]]s and is the first organ of the [[respiratory system]].  It is also the principal organ in the [[olfactory system]].  The shape of the [[nose]] is determined by the [[nasal bone]]s and the [[nasal cartilages]], including the [[nasal septum]] which separates the nostrils and divides the [[nasal cavity]] into two. On average the nose of a [[male]] is larger than that of a [[female]].\n\nThe main function of the nose is [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and the [[nasal mucosa]] lining the nasal cavity and the [[paranasal sinuses]] carries out the necessary conditioning of inhaled air by warming and moistening it. [[Nasal concha]]e, [[Conch|shell-like]] bones in the walls of the cavities, play a major part in this process. Filtering of the air by [[nasal hair]] in the nostrils prevents large particles from entering the lungs. [[Sneezing]] is a [[reflex]] to expel unwanted particles from the nose that irritate the mucosal lining. Sneezing can [[Transmission (medicine)|transmit infections]], because [[aerosol]]s are created in which the [[droplets]] can harbour [[pathogen]]s.\n\nAnother major function of the nose is [[olfaction]], the sense of smell. The area of [[olfactory epithelium]], in the upper nasal cavity, contains specialised [[olfactory cells]] responsible for this function.\n\nThe nose is also involved in the function of speech. [[Nasal vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant]]s are produced in the process of [[nasalisation]]. The nasal cavity is the third most effective [[vocal resonation|vocal resonator]].\n\nThere are many [[plastic surgery]] procedures on the nose, known as [[Rhinoplasty|rhinoplasties]] available to correct various structural defects or to change the shape of the nose. Defects may be [[Birth defect|congenital]], or result from nasal disorders or from trauma. These procedures are a type of [[plastic surgery#Reconstructive surgery|reconstructive surgery]]. [[Elective surgery|Elective procedures]] to change a nose shape are a type of [[plastic surgery#Cosmetic surgery procedures|cosmetic surgery]].\n\n==Structure==\nSeveral [[bone]]s and [[cartilage]]s make up the bony-cartilaginous framework of the nose, and the internal structure.<ref name=\"anatomy\" /> The nose is also made up of types of [[soft tissue]] such as [[skin]], [[epithelium|epithelia]], [[mucous membrane]], [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s, and [[blood]].

They are involved in respiration and facial expression. The muscles of the nose include the procerus, nasalis, depressor septi nasalis, levator labii superioris alaeque nasalis, and the orbicularis oris of the mouth. As are all of the facial muscles, the muscles of the nose are innervated by the facial nerve and its branches.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> Although each muscle is independent the muscles of the nose form a continuous layer with connections between all the components of the muscles and ligaments, in the nasal part of a [[superficial muscular aponeurotic system]].<ref name=\"Gray's2016\"  /><ref name=\"Saban\">{{cite journal |last1=Saban |first1=Y |last2=Andretto Amodeo |first2=C |last3=Hammou |first3=JC |last4=Polselli |first4=R |title=An anatomical study of the nasal superficial musculoaponeurotic system: surgical applications in rhinoplasty. |journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109\u201315 |doi=10.1001/archfaci.10.2.109 |pmid=18347238}}</ref> It is continuous from the nasofrontal process to the nasal tip. It divides at level of the nasal valve  into superficial and deep layers, each layer having medial and lateral components.<ref name=\"Saban\" />\n\nThe [[procerus muscle]] produces wrinkling over the bridge of the nose, and is active in concentration and frowning.

The compressor naris muscle compresses the nostrils and may completely close them. The alar part, the dilator naris mainly consists of the dilator naris posterior, and a much smaller dilator naris anterior, and this muscle flares the nostrils. The dilator naris helps to form the upper ridge of the philtrum.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> The anterior, and the posterior dilator naris, (the alar part of the nasalis muscle), give support to the nasal valves.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[Depressor septi nasi muscle|depressor septi muscle]] may sometimes be absent or rudimentary.  The depressor septi pulls the columella, the septum, and the tip of the nose downwards. At the start of inspiration this muscle tenses the nasal septum and with the dilator naris widens the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[levator labii superioris alaeque nasi]],  divides into a medial and a lateral slip. The medial slip blends into the perichondrium of the major alar cartilage and its overlying skin. The lateral slip blends at the side of the upper lip with the [[levator labii superioris]], and with the [[orbicularis oris]].  The lateral slip raises the upper lip and deepens  and increases the curve above the nasolabial furrow. The medial slip pulls the lateral crus upwards and modifies the curve of the furrow around the alae, and dilates the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\n===Soft tissue===\n\nThe skin of the nose varies in thickness along its length.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> From the glabella to the bridge (the nasofrontal angle) the skin is thick, fairly flexible, and mobile.

The frontonasal process gives rise to the bridge of the nose. The medial nasal processes provide the crest and the tip of the nose, and the lateral nasal processes form the alae or sides of the nose. The frontonasal process is a proliferation of mesenchyme in front of\u00a0 the brain vesicles,<ref name=Sadler /> and makes up the upper border of the stomadeum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\n\nDuring the fifth week the [[maxillary prominence|maxillary process]]es increase in size and at the same time the ectoderm of\u00a0 the frontonasal process becomes thickened at its sides and also increases in size,\u00a0 forming the nasal placodes. The nasal placodes are also known as the olfactory placodes. This development is induced by the ventral part of the forebrain.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\nIn the sixth week the ectoderm in each nasal placode invaginates to form an indented oval-shaped pit, which forms a\u00a0 surrounding\u00a0 raised ridge of tissue.<ref name=Larsen /> Each nasal pit forms a\u00a0 division between the ridges,\u00a0into a lateral nasal process on the outer edge, and a medial nasal process on the inner edge.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nIn the sixth week the nasal pits deepen as they penetrate into the underlying mesenchyme.<ref name=Sadler />\u00a0At this time, the medial nasal processes migrate towards each other and fuse forming the primordium of the bridge of the nose and the septum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0The migration is helped by the increased growth of the maxillary prominences medially, which compresses the medial nasal processes towards the midline.\u00a0 Their merging takes place at the surface, and also at a deeper level.<ref name=Sadler /> The merge forms the [[intermaxillary segment]], and this is continuous with the rostral part of the nasal septum. The tips of the maxillary processes also grow and fuse with the intermaxillary process. The intermaxillary process gives rise to the [[philtrum]] of the upper lip.<ref name=Sadler />\n\nAt the end of the sixth week the nasal pits have deepened further and they fuse to make a large ectodermal nasal sac. This sac will be above and to the back of the intermaxillary process. Leading into the seventh week, the nasal sac floor and posterior wall grow to form a thickened plate-like ectodermal structure called the nasal fin.<ref name=Larsen /> The nasal fin separates the sac from the oral cavity. Within the fin, vacuoles develop that fuse with the nasal sac. This enlarges the nasal sac and at the same time thins the fin to a membrane - the oronasal membrane that separates the nasal pits from the oral cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the seventh week the oronasal membrane ruptures and disintegrates to form an opening - the single primitive choana.\u00a0 The intermaxillary segment extends posteriorly to form the primary palate which makes up the floor of the nasal cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the eighth and ninth weeks a pair of thin extensions form from the medial walls of the maxillary process. These extensions are called the palatine shelves that form the secondary palate.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen /> The secondary palate will endochondrally ossify to form the hard palate - the end-stage floor of the nasal cavity.\u00a0 During this time ectoderm and mesoderm of the frontonasal process produce the midline septum. The septum grows down from the roof of the nasal cavity and fuses with the developing palates along the midline. The septum divides the nasal cavity into two nasal passages opening into the pharynx through the definitive choanae.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nAt ten weeks, the cells differentiate into [[muscle]], [[cartilage]], and [[bone]].

Two pairs of sinuses form during prenatal development and two pairs form after birth. The maxillary sinuses are the first to appear during the fetal third month. They slowly expand within the maxillary bones and continue to expand throughout childhood.\u00a0The maxillary sinuses form as invaginations from the nasal sac. The ethmoid sinuses appear in the fetal fifth month as invaginations of the middle meatus. The ethmoid sinuses do not grow into the ethmoid bone and do not completely develop until puberty.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\n\nThe sphenoid sinuses are extensions of the ethmoid sinuses into the sphenoid bones. They begin to develop around two years of age, and continue to enlarge during childhood.<ref name=\"Moore\" />\n\nThe frontal sinuses only develop in the fifth or sixth year of childhood, and continue expanding throughout adolescence. Each frontal sinus is made up of two independent spaces that develop from two different sources; one from the expansion of ethmoid sinuses into frontal bone, and the other develops from invagination.

It bears the [[nostril]]s and is the first organ of the [[respiratory system]].  It is also the principal organ in the [[olfactory system]].  The shape of the [[nose]] is determined by the [[nasal bone]]s and the [[nasal cartilages]], including the [[nasal septum]] which separates the nostrils and divides the [[nasal cavity]] into two. On average the nose of a [[male]] is larger than that of a [[female]].\n\nThe main function of the nose is [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and the [[nasal mucosa]] lining the nasal cavity and the [[paranasal sinuses]] carries out the necessary conditioning of inhaled air by warming and moistening it. [[Nasal concha]]e, [[Conch|shell-like]] bones in the walls of the cavities, play a major part in this process. Filtering of the air by [[nasal hair]] in the nostrils prevents large particles from entering the lungs. [[Sneezing]] is a [[reflex]] to expel unwanted particles from the nose that irritate the mucosal lining. Sneezing can [[Transmission (medicine)|transmit infections]], because [[aerosol]]s are created in which the [[droplets]] can harbour [[pathogen]]s.\n\nAnother major function of the nose is [[olfaction]], the sense of smell. The area of [[olfactory epithelium]], in the upper nasal cavity, contains specialised [[olfactory cells]] responsible for this function.\n\nThe nose is also involved in the function of speech. [[Nasal vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant]]s are produced in the process of [[nasalisation]]. The nasal cavity is the third most effective [[vocal resonation|vocal resonator]].\n\nThere are many [[plastic surgery]] procedures on the nose, known as [[Rhinoplasty|rhinoplasties]] available to correct various structural defects or to change the shape of the nose. Defects may be [[Birth defect|congenital]], or result from nasal disorders or from trauma. These procedures are a type of [[plastic surgery#Reconstructive surgery|reconstructive surgery]]. [[Elective surgery|Elective procedures]] to change a nose shape are a type of [[plastic surgery#Cosmetic surgery procedures|cosmetic surgery]].\n\n==Structure==\nSeveral [[bone]]s and [[cartilage]]s make up the bony-cartilaginous framework of the nose, and the internal structure.<ref name=\"anatomy\" /> The nose is also made up of types of [[soft tissue]] such as [[skin]], [[epithelium|epithelia]], [[mucous membrane]], [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s, and [[blood]].

They are involved in respiration and facial expression. The muscles of the nose include the procerus, nasalis, depressor septi nasalis, levator labii superioris alaeque nasalis, and the orbicularis oris of the mouth. As are all of the facial muscles, the muscles of the nose are innervated by the facial nerve and its branches.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> Although each muscle is independent the muscles of the nose form a continuous layer with connections between all the components of the muscles and ligaments, in the nasal part of a [[superficial muscular aponeurotic system]].<ref name=\"Gray's2016\"  /><ref name=\"Saban\">{{cite journal |last1=Saban |first1=Y |last2=Andretto Amodeo |first2=C |last3=Hammou |first3=JC |last4=Polselli |first4=R |title=An anatomical study of the nasal superficial musculoaponeurotic system: surgical applications in rhinoplasty. |journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109\u201315 |doi=10.1001/archfaci.10.2.109 |pmid=18347238}}</ref> It is continuous from the nasofrontal process to the nasal tip. It divides at level of the nasal valve  into superficial and deep layers, each layer having medial and lateral components.<ref name=\"Saban\" />\n\nThe [[procerus muscle]] produces wrinkling over the bridge of the nose, and is active in concentration and frowning. It is a prime target for [[Botulinum toxin#Cosmetics|Botox procedures]]<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> in the forehead to remove the lines between the eyes.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[nasalis muscle]] consists of two main parts: a transverse part called the [[compressor naris]], and an alar part termed the [[dilator naris muscle|dilator naris]].  The compressor naris muscle compresses the nostrils and may completely close them. The alar part, the dilator naris mainly consists of the dilator naris posterior, and a much smaller dilator naris anterior, and this muscle flares the nostrils. The dilator naris helps to form the upper ridge of the philtrum.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> The anterior, and the posterior dilator naris, (the alar part of the nasalis muscle), give support to the nasal valves.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[Depressor septi nasi muscle|depressor septi muscle]] may sometimes be absent or rudimentary.  The depressor septi pulls the columella, the septum, and the tip of the nose downwards. At the start of inspiration this muscle tenses the nasal septum and with the dilator naris widens the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[levator labii superioris alaeque nasi]],  divides into a medial and a lateral slip. The medial slip blends into the perichondrium of the major alar cartilage and its overlying skin. The lateral slip blends at the side of the upper lip with the [[levator labii superioris]], and with the [[orbicularis oris]].  The lateral slip raises the upper lip and deepens  and increases the curve above the nasolabial furrow. The medial slip pulls the lateral crus upwards and modifies the curve of the furrow around the alae, and dilates the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\n===Soft tissue===\n\nThe skin of the nose varies in thickness along its length.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> From the glabella to the bridge (the nasofrontal angle) the skin is thick, fairly flexible, and mobile.

The frontonasal process gives rise to the bridge of the nose. The medial nasal processes provide the crest and the tip of the nose, and the lateral nasal processes form the alae or sides of the nose. The frontonasal process is a proliferation of mesenchyme in front of\u00a0 the brain vesicles,<ref name=Sadler /> and makes up the upper border of the stomadeum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\n\nDuring the fifth week the [[maxillary prominence|maxillary process]]es increase in size and at the same time the ectoderm of\u00a0 the frontonasal process becomes thickened at its sides and also increases in size,\u00a0 forming the nasal placodes. The nasal placodes are also known as the olfactory placodes. This development is induced by the ventral part of the forebrain.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\nIn the sixth week the ectoderm in each nasal placode invaginates to form an indented oval-shaped pit, which forms a\u00a0 surrounding\u00a0 raised ridge of tissue.<ref name=Larsen /> Each nasal pit forms a\u00a0 division between the ridges,\u00a0into a lateral nasal process on the outer edge, and a medial nasal process on the inner edge.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nIn the sixth week the nasal pits deepen as they penetrate into the underlying mesenchyme.<ref name=Sadler />\u00a0At this time, the medial nasal processes migrate towards each other and fuse forming the primordium of the bridge of the nose and the septum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0The migration is helped by the increased growth of the maxillary prominences medially, which compresses the medial nasal processes towards the midline.\u00a0 Their merging takes place at the surface, and also at a deeper level.<ref name=Sadler /> The merge forms the [[intermaxillary segment]], and this is continuous with the rostral part of the nasal septum. The tips of the maxillary processes also grow and fuse with the intermaxillary process. The intermaxillary process gives rise to the [[philtrum]] of the upper lip.<ref name=Sadler />\n\nAt the end of the sixth week the nasal pits have deepened further and they fuse to make a large ectodermal nasal sac. This sac will be above and to the back of the intermaxillary process. Leading into the seventh week, the nasal sac floor and posterior wall grow to form a thickened plate-like ectodermal structure called the nasal fin.<ref name=Larsen /> The nasal fin separates the sac from the oral cavity. Within the fin, vacuoles develop that fuse with the nasal sac. This enlarges the nasal sac and at the same time thins the fin to a membrane - the oronasal membrane that separates the nasal pits from the oral cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the seventh week the oronasal membrane ruptures and disintegrates to form an opening - the single primitive choana.\u00a0 The intermaxillary segment extends posteriorly to form the primary palate which makes up the floor of the nasal cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the eighth and ninth weeks a pair of thin extensions form from the medial walls of the maxillary process. These extensions are called the palatine shelves that form the secondary palate.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen /> The secondary palate will endochondrally ossify to form the hard palate - the end-stage floor of the nasal cavity.\u00a0 During this time ectoderm and mesoderm of the frontonasal process produce the midline septum. The septum grows down from the roof of the nasal cavity and fuses with the developing palates along the midline. The septum divides the nasal cavity into two nasal passages opening into the pharynx through the definitive choanae.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nAt ten weeks, the cells differentiate into [[muscle]], [[cartilage]], and [[bone]].

Two pairs of sinuses form during prenatal development and two pairs form after birth. The maxillary sinuses are the first to appear during the fetal third month. They slowly expand within the maxillary bones and continue to expand throughout childhood.\u00a0The maxillary sinuses form as invaginations from the nasal sac. The ethmoid sinuses appear in the fetal fifth month as invaginations of the middle meatus. The ethmoid sinuses do not grow into the ethmoid bone and do not completely develop until puberty.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\n\nThe sphenoid sinuses are extensions of the ethmoid sinuses into the sphenoid bones. They begin to develop around two years of age, and continue to enlarge during childhood.<ref name=\"Moore\" />\n\nThe frontal sinuses only develop in the fifth or sixth year of childhood, and continue expanding throughout adolescence. Each frontal sinus is made up of two independent spaces that develop from two different sources; one from the expansion of ethmoid sinuses into frontal bone, and the other develops from invagination.

The stele was essentially an extension of the cinctus, rather than a discrete appendage, and would have been fairly stiff side-to-side but possibly more flexible up and down.<ref name=Jefferies1990/> The stele was not a holdfast, but may have served to stabilize the animal.<ref name=Smith2005/> In most cinctans, the overall shape of the theca was only mildly asymmetrical, but in the unusual genus ''Lignanicystis'' the theca was highly asymmetrical, convergent on the [[stylophora]]ns in some respects.<ref name=Zamora2008/> The species ''Graciacystis'' could reach a theca length of {{convert|14.5|mm|in}}.<ref name=Zamora2013A/> \n\nThe theca of cinctans contained three major openings. The mouth was located on the right side of the anterior end, in the cinctus, and was associated with marginal grooves. All species had a left marginal groove, but the right marginal groove was sometimes absent and always shorter than the left one.

The body of cinctans was divided into two sections, the main body, called the theca, and a posterior appendage called a stele. The overall shape of cinctans has been compared to a tennis racquet.<ref name=Jefferies1990/> The theca of cinctans was surrounded on its margins by a frame of large stereom plates called a cinctus, and the dorsal and ventral surfaces were covered in a tessellated arrangement of small plates. The stele was essentially an extension of the cinctus, rather than a discrete appendage, and would have been fairly stiff side-to-side but possibly more flexible up and down.<ref name=Jefferies1990/> The stele was not a holdfast, but may have served to stabilize the animal.<ref name=Smith2005/> In most cinctans, the overall shape of the theca was only mildly asymmetrical, but in the unusual genus ''Lignanicystis'' the theca was highly asymmetrical, convergent on the [[stylophora]]ns in some respects.<ref name=Zamora2008/> The species ''Graciacystis'' could reach a theca length of {{convert|14.5|mm|in}}.<ref name=Zamora2013A/> \n\nThe theca of cinctans contained three major openings. The mouth was located on the right side of the anterior end, in the cinctus, and was associated with marginal grooves. All species had a left marginal groove, but the right marginal groove was sometimes absent and always shorter than the left one. The anus was located near the anterior end, on the right side, indicating that the gut was U-shaped. It was surrounded by a cone of plates equivalent to the [[periproct]] of modern echinoderms.<ref name=Smith2005/> The largest opening, called the porta, was located at the anterior end and was covered by an operculum.

It consists of {{convert|62.87|sqkm}} of land,<ref name=CTP /> spanning the towns of [[Torquay]], [[Paignton]] and [[Brixham]], located around an east-facing natural harbour ([[Tor Bay]]) on the [[English Channel]]. A popular tourist destination with a tight conurbation of [[resort town]]s, Torbay's sandy beaches, mild climate and recreational and leisure attractions have given rise to the nickname of the '''English Riviera'''.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Devon}}\nHuman bones and tools found in [[Kents Cavern]] in Torquay show that the Torbay area has been inhabited since [[Paleolithic]] times. A [[maxilla]] fragment known as [[Kents Cavern 4]] may be the oldest example of a [[modern human]] in Europe, dating back to 37,000&ndash;40,000 years ago.<ref>John R.

[[Kirkham House]] is a late [[medieval]] stone house and the Coverdale Tower adjacent to Paignton Parish Church is named after Bishop [[Miles Coverdale]], who published an English translation of the Bible in 1536. Paignton remained a small fishing village until the early 19th century; a new harbour was built here in 1837.\n\nThe second phase in the urban expansion of the area began when [[Torre railway station]] was opened in December 1848. The railway was extended to Torquay Seafront station in 1858, Paignton in 1859 and to Brixham in 1861. As a result of its expansion, Torquay was granted borough status in 1872, and 1902 saw its first marketing campaign to summer tourists.\n\nTorbay Golf and Country Club (now defunct) opened in 1933. The club and course closed in the mid-1950s.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php/england/south-west/devon/1007-dev-torbay-golf-a-country-club-shorton-road-paignton \"Torbay Golf & Country Club\"], \"Golf's Missing Links\".</ref>\n\nTor Bay hosted the [[Sailing at the 1948 Summer Olympics|sailing]] events for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe [[County Borough]] of Torbay was created in 1968 by the amalgamation of the [[Municipal Borough]] of Torquay, [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] of Paignton and Urban District of Brixham, also taking in parts of the [[civil parishes]] of [[Coffinswell]] and Kerswells from Newton Abbot Rural District and [[Churston Ferrers]] and [[Marldon]] from Totnes Rural District. The County Borough became the Borough of Torbay under local government reorganisation in 1974. It was made a [[unitary authority]] on 1 April 1998 making it responsible for its own affairs.\n\n==Governance==\nThe area is represented nationally at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by two MPs. Torquay (along with part of Paignton) is in the [[Torbay (UK Parliament constituency)|Torbay parliamentary constituency]] which was created in 1974 and was won by [[Kevin Foster (politician)|Kevin Foster]] for the Conservatives in 2015 having been held by [[Adrian Sanders]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] from 1997-2015. Brixham and part of Paignton fall within the [[Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Totnes constituency]], with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Dr [[Sarah Wollaston]] representing the constituency since 2010, having resigned from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] during the [[List of MPs elected in the 2017 United Kingdom general election|2017-2022 parliament]] in February 2019 joining The Independent Group later styled Change UK, then as an Independent MP then finally as Liberal Democrat in August 2019. Torbay is in the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]], together with the rest of [[South West England]] and [[Gibraltar]].\n\nUntil May 2011, [[Torbay Council]] had been headed by the first directly elected mayor in the [[South West England|South West region]]. [[Conservative Party(UK)|Conservative]] candidate [[Nicholas Bye]] who won in October 2005, under an electoral system which was later described as \"a total failure\" with Bye receiving votes from fewer than 7% of the electorate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4374914.stm|title= Mayor voting system is condemned|accessdate=2008-04-03 | date=25 October 2005| work=BBC News}}</ref> However, running as an independent he was defeated in the May 2011 election by Gordon Oliver who stood as a Conservative.

Torbay palms in the foreground.]]\nThere are three main towns around the marine inlet of Tor Bay: [[Torquay]] in the north, [[Paignton]] in the centre, and [[Brixham]] in the south. These have become connected over the years, swallowing up villages and towns such as [[St Marychurch]], [[Cockington]], [[Churston Ferrers]] and [[Galmpton, Torbay|Galmpton]], though the latter maintains a rural feel thanks to tight conservation measures. The borough of Torbay is bordered by the [[South Hams]] to the south and west, and by [[Teignbridge]] to the north. Nearby towns include [[Totnes]] and [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in the South Hams, and [[Newton Abbot]] and [[Teignmouth]] in Teignbridge.\n\nThe southern limit of Tor Bay is [[Berry Head]], and the northern limit is Hope's Nose, although Torquay itself stretches further north into [[Babbacombe Bay]], where the beaches at [[Oddicombe Beach|Oddicombe]], [[Babbacombe]] and [[Maidencombe]] can be found; these are noted for their interesting [[Breccia]] cliffs. Torbay's many geological features have led to the establishment of the [[English Riviera Geopark]]; as of July 2008, this is the sole urban geopark of the 53 [[geopark]]s worldwide.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/17/torbay_geopark_status_feature.shtml Global status for Torbay] (retrieved 7 July 2008)</ref>\n\nBecause of the mild climate, Torbay palm trees are a common sight along the coast. However, these are in fact not palms but ''[[Cordyline australis]]'', originating from [[New Zealand]] where it is known as \"cabbage tree\". These trees also flourish elsewhere in the UK. It is suggested that the popularity of cabbage trees in Torbay is attributable to their first being introduced to the UK in that region.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Settlements==\n\nTorbay includes:\n\n*[[Torquay]] including suburbs\n*[[Paignton]] including suburbs\n*[[Brixham]] including suburbs\n*[[Maidencombe]]\n*[[Yalberton]]\n*[[Blagdon]]\n*[[Churston Ferrers]]\n*[[Galmpton, Torbay|Galmpton]]\n\n==Demography==\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] confirmed Torbay's reputation as a retirement area, with a higher proportion of all age groups over the age of 50 than nationally.

The [[A3022 road]] serves all three towns and varies from dual carriageway and single carriageway.\n\nThe bus franchise is largely operated by [[Stagecoach South West]].

It consists of {{convert|62.87|sqkm}} of land,<ref name=CTP /> spanning the towns of [[Torquay]], [[Paignton]] and [[Brixham]], located around an east-facing natural harbour ([[Tor Bay]]) on the [[English Channel]]. A popular tourist destination with a tight conurbation of [[resort town]]s, Torbay's sandy beaches, mild climate and recreational and leisure attractions have given rise to the nickname of the '''English Riviera'''.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Devon}}\nHuman bones and tools found in [[Kents Cavern]] in Torquay show that the Torbay area has been inhabited since [[Paleolithic]] times. A [[maxilla]] fragment known as [[Kents Cavern 4]] may be the oldest example of a [[modern human]] in Europe, dating back to 37,000&ndash;40,000 years ago.<ref>John R.

[[Kirkham House]] is a late [[medieval]] stone house and the Coverdale Tower adjacent to Paignton Parish Church is named after Bishop [[Miles Coverdale]], who published an English translation of the Bible in 1536. Paignton remained a small fishing village until the early 19th century; a new harbour was built here in 1837.\n\nThe second phase in the urban expansion of the area began when [[Torre railway station]] was opened in December 1848. The railway was extended to Torquay Seafront station in 1858, Paignton in 1859 and to Brixham in 1861. As a result of its expansion, Torquay was granted borough status in 1872, and 1902 saw its first marketing campaign to summer tourists.\n\nTorbay Golf and Country Club (now defunct) opened in 1933. The club and course closed in the mid-1950s.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php/england/south-west/devon/1007-dev-torbay-golf-a-country-club-shorton-road-paignton \"Torbay Golf & Country Club\"], \"Golf's Missing Links\".</ref>\n\nTor Bay hosted the [[Sailing at the 1948 Summer Olympics|sailing]] events for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe [[County Borough]] of Torbay was created in 1968 by the amalgamation of the [[Municipal Borough]] of Torquay, [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] of Paignton and Urban District of Brixham, also taking in parts of the [[civil parishes]] of [[Coffinswell]] and Kerswells from Newton Abbot Rural District and [[Churston Ferrers]] and [[Marldon]] from Totnes Rural District. The County Borough became the Borough of Torbay under local government reorganisation in 1974. It was made a [[unitary authority]] on 1 April 1998 making it responsible for its own affairs.\n\n==Governance==\nThe area is represented nationally at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by two MPs. Torquay (along with part of Paignton) is in the [[Torbay (UK Parliament constituency)|Torbay parliamentary constituency]] which was created in 1974 and was won by [[Kevin Foster (politician)|Kevin Foster]] for the Conservatives in 2015 having been held by [[Adrian Sanders]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] from 1997-2015. Brixham and part of Paignton fall within the [[Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Totnes constituency]], with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Dr [[Sarah Wollaston]] representing the constituency since 2010, having resigned from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] during the [[List of MPs elected in the 2017 United Kingdom general election|2017-2022 parliament]] in February 2019 joining The Independent Group later styled Change UK, then as an Independent MP then finally as Liberal Democrat in August 2019. Torbay is in the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]], together with the rest of [[South West England]] and [[Gibraltar]].\n\nUntil May 2011, [[Torbay Council]] had been headed by the first directly elected mayor in the [[South West England|South West region]]. [[Conservative Party(UK)|Conservative]] candidate [[Nicholas Bye]] who won in October 2005, under an electoral system which was later described as \"a total failure\" with Bye receiving votes from fewer than 7% of the electorate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4374914.stm|title= Mayor voting system is condemned|accessdate=2008-04-03 | date=25 October 2005| work=BBC News}}</ref> However, running as an independent he was defeated in the May 2011 election by Gordon Oliver who stood as a Conservative.

Torbay palms in the foreground.]]\nThere are three main towns around the marine inlet of Tor Bay: [[Torquay]] in the north, [[Paignton]] in the centre, and [[Brixham]] in the south. These have become connected over the years, swallowing up villages and towns such as [[St Marychurch]], [[Cockington]], [[Churston Ferrers]] and [[Galmpton, Torbay|Galmpton]], though the latter maintains a rural feel thanks to tight conservation measures. The borough of Torbay is bordered by the [[South Hams]] to the south and west, and by [[Teignbridge]] to the north. Nearby towns include [[Totnes]] and [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in the South Hams, and [[Newton Abbot]] and [[Teignmouth]] in Teignbridge.\n\nThe southern limit of Tor Bay is [[Berry Head]], and the northern limit is Hope's Nose, although Torquay itself stretches further north into [[Babbacombe Bay]], where the beaches at [[Oddicombe Beach|Oddicombe]], [[Babbacombe]] and [[Maidencombe]] can be found; these are noted for their interesting [[Breccia]] cliffs. Torbay's many geological features have led to the establishment of the [[English Riviera Geopark]]; as of July 2008, this is the sole urban geopark of the 53 [[geopark]]s worldwide.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/17/torbay_geopark_status_feature.shtml Global status for Torbay] (retrieved 7 July 2008)</ref>\n\nBecause of the mild climate, Torbay palm trees are a common sight along the coast. However, these are in fact not palms but ''[[Cordyline australis]]'', originating from [[New Zealand]] where it is known as \"cabbage tree\". These trees also flourish elsewhere in the UK. It is suggested that the popularity of cabbage trees in Torbay is attributable to their first being introduced to the UK in that region.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Settlements==\n\nTorbay includes:\n\n*[[Torquay]] including suburbs\n*[[Paignton]] including suburbs\n*[[Brixham]] including suburbs\n*[[Maidencombe]]\n*[[Yalberton]]\n*[[Blagdon]]\n*[[Churston Ferrers]]\n*[[Galmpton, Torbay|Galmpton]]\n\n==Demography==\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] confirmed Torbay's reputation as a retirement area, with a higher proportion of all age groups over the age of 50 than nationally. However compared to 2001, age groups 75-79 and 80-85 both showed a decline of around 4%, compared to increases of 1.5% and 14% for the whole country.<ref name=CTP />\n\nSome other statistics from the 2011 census:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! heading | Marital status\n! heading | Number of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-327143|title=2011 Census: KS103UK Marital and civil partnership status, local authorities in the United Kingdom (Excel sheet 222Kb)|date=11 October 2013|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| Single (never married)\n| 31,809\n|-\n| Married or remarried\n| 50,891\n|-\n| Separated or divorced\n| 16,207\n|-\n| Widowed\n| 10,030\n|-\n|}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! heading | Religion\n! heading | Number of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks209ew.xls|title=2011 Census: KS209EW Religion, local authorities in England and Wales (Excel sheet 270Kb)|date=11 December 2012|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| Christian\n| 82,924\n|-\n| Buddhist\n| 389\n|-\n| Hindu\n| 128\n|-\n| Jewish\n| 109\n|-\n| Muslim\n| 521\n|-\n| Sikh\n| 41\n|-\n| Other\n| 702\n|-\n| No religion\n| 36,035\n|-\n| Religion not stated\n| 10,110\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Economy==\nTorbay's main industry is tourism.

The rest of the road to Tweenaways Cross is single carriageway.\n\n[[File:English Riviera Tours JTD395P.jpg|thumb|right|An open top bus advertising the \"English Riviera\"]]\nTorbay's other main road links are the [[A379 road|A379]], which follows a coastal route from [[Teignmouth]], passes through Torquay and Paignton, then goes on to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]; and the [[A385 road]] which goes inland to [[Totnes]] and the [[A38 road|A38]]. The [[A3022 road]] serves all three towns and varies from dual carriageway and single carriageway.\n\nThe bus franchise is largely operated by [[Stagecoach South West]]. The other bus company operating throughout Torbay is Local Link.\n\nTorbay has three stations on the [[National Rail]] network, operated by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]]: [[Torre railway station]] is inland on the road from Torquay to Newton Abbot, [[Torquay railway station]] is close to Torre Abbey Sands and [[Paignton railway station]] serves that town and links with the heritage [[Dartmouth Steam Railway]] to [[Kingswear]], connecting via the Dart ferry to Dartmouth.\n\nA new station at [[Edginswell railway station|Edginswell]] was planned to open in December 2018 as part of the Devon Metro scheme but lack of funding has prevented its construction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abbot|first1=HEC|title=Herald Express|url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/torquay-s-edginswell-railway-station-approved/story-29096374-detail/story.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\nFamous former residents of Torbay include authors [[Agatha Christie]] (who set many of her novels in a thinly disguised version of the borough), [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Edmund Gosse]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]].

In 1970, onwards, it had returned simply as \"Pelican.\"\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000, there were 163 people, 70 households, and 41 families residing in the city. The population density was 280.5 people per square mile (108.5/km\u00b2). There were 94 housing units at an average density of 161.8 per square&nbsp;mile (62.6/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 72.39% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 21.47% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 1.23% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.61% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.29% from two or more races. 0.61% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 70 households out of which 30.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 5.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.4% were non-families. 28.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

None of the families and 4.7% of the population were living below the [[poverty line]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Shipwreck===\n\nAccording to legend, many years ago when Russian ships roamed Alaska waters, one foundered in the uncharted waters of Cross Sound. Survivors rowed their lifeboat up an inlet that would later be known as Lisianski. In a sheltered cove they founded a settlement. They cleared and planted gardens, trapped and hunted game. The story goes that a shipyard was built and a ship constructed, which allowed them to return to their homeland.\n\nWhen the Russian settlement died, the land again reverted to wilderness. Early hunters and trappers noticed the clearing in the woods, and found iron and copper tools along with sunken graves. They named the abandoned settlement \"Sunnyside\".\n[[File:Russian ship spike found in ground near Lisianski Inlet Lodge.jpg|alt=Potential Russian ship spike found in ground near Lisianski inlet Lodge|thumb|Possible Russian ship spike from the 1700s]]\nThe Lisianski Inlet Lodge is located on the site of the old Russian settlement at Sunnyside, and the owners can attest to there being \"mounds\" nearby in the trees that may be burial sites and of finding tools in the ground.\n\nIn the late 1970s Paul Corbin found what appears to be a spike from a Russian ship while digging a garbage pit a few hundred yards behind the Lodge. A few years later Denny Corbin found a pair of eyeglasses while digging to enforce a coffer dam in the woods behind the lodge. The eyeglasses had gold rims, blue glass and diamond shaped pieces of jade in each corner.\n\n===Mining exploration===\n\nBy 1938 the Lisianski Inlet had become home to gold miners.  Hjalmar Mork, Jack Ronning and the older of the Mork family boys operated the Mork mine, called the Goldwin Prospect.\n  \nBesides the Mork mine there was a gold mine called the Apex, founded earlier, which can be found across the inlet from Sunnyside. The Apex-El Nido mine produced 18,000 ounces of gold. Jack Koby was developing a mine called Lucky Strike up towards the head of the inlet, and another mine was being worked at its mouth.<ref name=Carson>{{Cite news\n  | last = Carson\n  | first = Norm\n  | author-link = \n  | last2 = \n  | first2 = \n  | author2-link = \n  | title = Settling closest to the fish: Pelican's early years\n  | newspaper = [[Capital City Weekly]]\n  | pages = 7\u20138\n  | date = 23\u201329 September 2009\n  | url = \n  | accessdate =\n  | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>  This is the Lisianski Inlet Kalle (Charley) Raatikainen found when he started looking for a place to build a town.\n\n===1938-1941 fish processing and storage development===\n\nRaatikainen was an Alaskan pioneer and fish buyer when fish made people wealthy. During the fishing season he would hardly sleep, as he bought fish and ran them from the fishing grounds to Sitka. Raatikainen would leave Deer Harbor when the last troller had unloaded for the night. He would arrive in Sitka around three in the morning awaken the crew, unload, pick up groceries and arrive back on the fishing grounds by noon. Hoping to give better and faster service to the fisherman and buyers, he began looking for a place to build a cold storage plant close to the fishing grounds.\n\n====Location and pilings====\n\nRaatikainen went to his friend Hjalmar Mork and told him what he was looking for. On August 2, 1938, Hjalmar took him to a place up the inlet near his mine and suggested the location.<ref name=Carson/> Raatikainen found a harbor with deep water, land and a large lake with a waterfall. Located between [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] and Sitka, the site had everything he was looking for.\n\nRaatikainen organized a corporation and brought in a crew to start the building. On September 26, 1938, his boat the ''Pelican'' brought in [[Bob DeArmond]] as timekeeper and storekeeper, Eli Rapich as cook's helper and another cook known as Slim.<ref name=Carson/> Others may have been Don White and Gust Savela. A. P. \"Coho\" Walder and his wife Martha arrived with their troller<ref name=Carson/> and Raatikainen had one or two others with him when he brought in his fish scows. One scow was put on the beach and became the messhouse with worker quarters in the upper section. The other scow was anchored out and connected to the beach by a floating walkway. It served as a warehouse as well as living quarters for workers. The town site became known as Pelican City. Why is not known, but probably not to confuse it with Raatikainen's boat the ''Pelican''.\n\nJoe and Jim Paddock came with their pile driving equipment. They used their donkey engine on the pile driver to clear timber from the cold storage site. Hjalmer Mork and Jack Ronning moved their air compressor and jackhammers up from their mine to clear rock from the cold storage site.\n\n====Building supplies====\n\nThe steam schooner the ''SS Tongass'' arrived and dropped overboard tons of lumber and pilings in front of the town, despite Raatikainen's lack of funds. DeArmond was the one that had to request that the captain of the ''Tongass'' defer the payment.<ref name=Carson/> A sawmill and other supplies were loaded on rafts and dragged ashore. The ''SS Tongass'' would be the only steamer into Pelican for the next few years with supplies but not on regular basis.\n\nThe first building erected ashore had a dual purpose. It housed a [[Finnish sauna|Finnish steam bath]] on one side and on the other a store and offices for the new corporation. During this time, Pelican was often referred to as \"Finn Town\".<ref name=Carson/> The town started looking like a town when the Paddocks and Raatikainen built homes. Arthur Silverman arrived from Sitka with lumber, beer and a license to operate a beer parlor and soon was open for business.\n\nThe expense of building a cold storage, acquiring diesel engines, building a water and electric system left the company short of money. Raatikainen went to [[Seattle]] and raised money, but it was never enough. The town continued to grow, because the depression left little winter work elsewhere. Fishermen and others were willing to take food, tobacco and stock in the company for their work.\n\n====Fire and general expansion====\n\nThere was a major setback when the bathhouse caught fire and the only available fire equipment was a few buckets of salt water brought up from the beach. The bath/store building was quickly replaced and would later become home to Pelican's first school. One of the first major construction sites was a two-story multipurpose building. On the first floor a kitchen and mess hall occupied one end with the office, store and later the post office on the other side. The upper floor was used for a bunkhouse. This building's second floor is still used as a bunkhouse.\n\nGus Savela, a Finn and Alaskan fish buyer with engineering experience, oversaw the building of the dam.<ref name=Carson/> With the sawmill that had arrived on the ''Tongass'', the Paddock brothers built the wharf, fish house and started the boardwalk.<ref name=Carson/> When the summer fishing season began, the men left to work other jobs or fish their boats and even Raatikainen had to take his scows to their summer stations.\n\nWork slowed in 1939, when the Navy began building a base on [[Japonski Island]] and outside jobs became available. Even so, a post office under the name \"Pelican\" was established on November 27, 1939 with Bob DeArmond as first postmaster. Pelican's school opened with Arvo Wahto, of Douglas, becoming its first teacher. He would teach two generations of children before retiring in the 60's.  A sawmill was built and put into operation producing the lumber to build homes adding to the permanence of the town.\n\nIn the summer of 1940 things got livelier when A. R. Breuger of [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]] brought his floating cannery to Pelican and moored it to the dock. It brought new people and small seine boats to town, and employment to a few of the residents. By the summer of 1941 Pelican had another salmon cannery. The Cape Cross Salmon Company organized by Larry Freeburn and Pros Ganty put canning machinery and a retort in the fish house, they made a pack of more than 17,000 cases. Later, Cape Cross would build a separate cannery next to the cold storage.\n\n====Completion====\n\nHenry Roden, the former attorney general of Alaska who was helping Raatikainen raise money, finally had success when [[Norton Clapp]] agreed to participate in the project. The work of getting the cold storage plant operating immediately gathered speed. J. P. McNeil, who had been in charge of the Booth Fisheries cold storage at Sitka for many years, was hired as manager to oversee the installation of the refrigeration machinery. The hydroelectric power plant was completed and a new office and store building were attached to the cold storage.\n\nIn August 1942 the first fish was loaded into the sharp freezer.

In 1970, onwards, it had returned simply as \"Pelican.\"\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000, there were 163 people, 70 households, and 41 families residing in the city. The population density was 280.5 people per square mile (108.5/km\u00b2). There were 94 housing units at an average density of 161.8 per square&nbsp;mile (62.6/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 72.39% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 21.47% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 1.23% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.61% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.29% from two or more races. 0.61% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 70 households out of which 30.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 5.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.4% were non-families. 28.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

None of the families and 4.7% of the population were living below the [[poverty line]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Shipwreck===\n\nAccording to legend, many years ago when Russian ships roamed Alaska waters, one foundered in the uncharted waters of Cross Sound. Survivors rowed their lifeboat up an inlet that would later be known as Lisianski. In a sheltered cove they founded a settlement. They cleared and planted gardens, trapped and hunted game. The story goes that a shipyard was built and a ship constructed, which allowed them to return to their homeland.\n\nWhen the Russian settlement died, the land again reverted to wilderness. Early hunters and trappers noticed the clearing in the woods, and found iron and copper tools along with sunken graves. They named the abandoned settlement \"Sunnyside\".\n[[File:Russian ship spike found in ground near Lisianski Inlet Lodge.jpg|alt=Potential Russian ship spike found in ground near Lisianski inlet Lodge|thumb|Possible Russian ship spike from the 1700s]]\nThe Lisianski Inlet Lodge is located on the site of the old Russian settlement at Sunnyside, and the owners can attest to there being \"mounds\" nearby in the trees that may be burial sites and of finding tools in the ground.\n\nIn the late 1970s Paul Corbin found what appears to be a spike from a Russian ship while digging a garbage pit a few hundred yards behind the Lodge. A few years later Denny Corbin found a pair of eyeglasses while digging to enforce a coffer dam in the woods behind the lodge. The eyeglasses had gold rims, blue glass and diamond shaped pieces of jade in each corner.\n\n===Mining exploration===\n\nBy 1938 the Lisianski Inlet had become home to gold miners.  Hjalmar Mork, Jack Ronning and the older of the Mork family boys operated the Mork mine, called the Goldwin Prospect.\n  \nBesides the Mork mine there was a gold mine called the Apex, founded earlier, which can be found across the inlet from Sunnyside. The Apex-El Nido mine produced 18,000 ounces of gold. Jack Koby was developing a mine called Lucky Strike up towards the head of the inlet, and another mine was being worked at its mouth.<ref name=Carson>{{Cite news\n  | last = Carson\n  | first = Norm\n  | author-link = \n  | last2 = \n  | first2 = \n  | author2-link = \n  | title = Settling closest to the fish: Pelican's early years\n  | newspaper = [[Capital City Weekly]]\n  | pages = 7\u20138\n  | date = 23\u201329 September 2009\n  | url = \n  | accessdate =\n  | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>  This is the Lisianski Inlet Kalle (Charley) Raatikainen found when he started looking for a place to build a town.\n\n===1938-1941 fish processing and storage development===\n\nRaatikainen was an Alaskan pioneer and fish buyer when fish made people wealthy. During the fishing season he would hardly sleep, as he bought fish and ran them from the fishing grounds to Sitka. Raatikainen would leave Deer Harbor when the last troller had unloaded for the night. He would arrive in Sitka around three in the morning awaken the crew, unload, pick up groceries and arrive back on the fishing grounds by noon. Hoping to give better and faster service to the fisherman and buyers, he began looking for a place to build a cold storage plant close to the fishing grounds.\n\n====Location and pilings====\n\nRaatikainen went to his friend Hjalmar Mork and told him what he was looking for. On August 2, 1938, Hjalmar took him to a place up the inlet near his mine and suggested the location.<ref name=Carson/> Raatikainen found a harbor with deep water, land and a large lake with a waterfall. Located between [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] and Sitka, the site had everything he was looking for.\n\nRaatikainen organized a corporation and brought in a crew to start the building. On September 26, 1938, his boat the ''Pelican'' brought in [[Bob DeArmond]] as timekeeper and storekeeper, Eli Rapich as cook's helper and another cook known as Slim.<ref name=Carson/> Others may have been Don White and Gust Savela. A. P. \"Coho\" Walder and his wife Martha arrived with their troller<ref name=Carson/> and Raatikainen had one or two others with him when he brought in his fish scows. One scow was put on the beach and became the messhouse with worker quarters in the upper section. The other scow was anchored out and connected to the beach by a floating walkway. It served as a warehouse as well as living quarters for workers. The town site became known as Pelican City. Why is not known, but probably not to confuse it with Raatikainen's boat the ''Pelican''.\n\nJoe and Jim Paddock came with their pile driving equipment. They used their donkey engine on the pile driver to clear timber from the cold storage site. Hjalmer Mork and Jack Ronning moved their air compressor and jackhammers up from their mine to clear rock from the cold storage site.\n\n====Building supplies====\n\nThe steam schooner the ''SS Tongass'' arrived and dropped overboard tons of lumber and pilings in front of the town, despite Raatikainen's lack of funds. DeArmond was the one that had to request that the captain of the ''Tongass'' defer the payment.<ref name=Carson/> A sawmill and other supplies were loaded on rafts and dragged ashore. The ''SS Tongass'' would be the only steamer into Pelican for the next few years with supplies but not on regular basis.\n\nThe first building erected ashore had a dual purpose. It housed a [[Finnish sauna|Finnish steam bath]] on one side and on the other a store and offices for the new corporation. During this time, Pelican was often referred to as \"Finn Town\".<ref name=Carson/> The town started looking like a town when the Paddocks and Raatikainen built homes. Arthur Silverman arrived from Sitka with lumber, beer and a license to operate a beer parlor and soon was open for business.\n\nThe expense of building a cold storage, acquiring diesel engines, building a water and electric system left the company short of money. Raatikainen went to [[Seattle]] and raised money, but it was never enough. The town continued to grow, because the depression left little winter work elsewhere. Fishermen and others were willing to take food, tobacco and stock in the company for their work.\n\n====Fire and general expansion====\n\nThere was a major setback when the bathhouse caught fire and the only available fire equipment was a few buckets of salt water brought up from the beach. The bath/store building was quickly replaced and would later become home to Pelican's first school. One of the first major construction sites was a two-story multipurpose building. On the first floor a kitchen and mess hall occupied one end with the office, store and later the post office on the other side. The upper floor was used for a bunkhouse. This building's second floor is still used as a bunkhouse.\n\nGus Savela, a Finn and Alaskan fish buyer with engineering experience, oversaw the building of the dam.<ref name=Carson/> With the sawmill that had arrived on the ''Tongass'', the Paddock brothers built the wharf, fish house and started the boardwalk.<ref name=Carson/> When the summer fishing season began, the men left to work other jobs or fish their boats and even Raatikainen had to take his scows to their summer stations.\n\nWork slowed in 1939, when the Navy began building a base on [[Japonski Island]] and outside jobs became available. Even so, a post office under the name \"Pelican\" was established on November 27, 1939 with Bob DeArmond as first postmaster. Pelican's school opened with Arvo Wahto, of Douglas, becoming its first teacher. He would teach two generations of children before retiring in the 60's.  A sawmill was built and put into operation producing the lumber to build homes adding to the permanence of the town.\n\nIn the summer of 1940 things got livelier when A. R. Breuger of [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]] brought his floating cannery to Pelican and moored it to the dock. It brought new people and small seine boats to town, and employment to a few of the residents. By the summer of 1941 Pelican had another salmon cannery. The Cape Cross Salmon Company organized by Larry Freeburn and Pros Ganty put canning machinery and a retort in the fish house, they made a pack of more than 17,000 cases. Later, Cape Cross would build a separate cannery next to the cold storage.\n\n====Completion====\n\nHenry Roden, the former attorney general of Alaska who was helping Raatikainen raise money, finally had success when [[Norton Clapp]] agreed to participate in the project. The work of getting the cold storage plant operating immediately gathered speed. J. P. McNeil, who had been in charge of the Booth Fisheries cold storage at Sitka for many years, was hired as manager to oversee the installation of the refrigeration machinery. The hydroelectric power plant was completed and a new office and store building were attached to the cold storage.\n\nIn August 1942 the first fish was loaded into the sharp freezer. The census in 1939 gave Pelican a count of 48. In 1951 it was up to 180, it would later reach its peak at 250.\n\n===Recent history===\n\n[[File:Pelican Alaska in August 2019.jpg|thumb|A view of Pelican from above Salmon Way, featuring the marina and First and Second Islands.]]\n\nPelican Seafoods closed for business in July 2008.
