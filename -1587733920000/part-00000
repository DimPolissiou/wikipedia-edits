{"title_page": "List of cases of the Supreme Court of Pakistan", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Supreme Court of Pakistan}}\nThis is an index of lists of cases decided by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]].\n\n==By Former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry==\n\nThese lists are sorted chronologically by Chief Justice and include all notable cases decided by the court. Articles exist for almost all cases.\n\n== A Few Major Cases ==\n\n===Molvi Tamizuddin Khan Case===\n{{Main|Federation of Pakistan v. Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan}}\nIn Molvi Tamizuddin Khan case, the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Mohammad Munir backed Governor General Ghulam Mohammad's action to dissolve the first  Constitutional Assembly. This judgement of Supreme Court is always strongly criticized by all democratic parties of Pakistan and is referred as a root cause of unstable democracy in Pakistan.needs citation pld 1955 fc 240\n\n===The Usif Patel Case===\nThe Federal Court (Supreme Court) announced in the main Constitutional Case 'Usif Patel and 2 others versus The Crown', PLD 1955 Federal Court 387 (Appellate Jurisdiction), that the governor general had no capacity to make provisions to the Constitution of Pakistan. After this decision of the Federal Court the nation confronted Constitutional emergency which was more prominent than when the governor general had dissolved the Constituent Assembly.But the decision was expressly limited to Governor General's powers under section 42 of the Government of India act, 1935.\n\n===Dosso vs Federation of Pakistan===\n{{Main|Dosso case}}\nIn Dosso's case (1958), the Pakistan Supreme Court used jurist Hans Kelsen's theory that a revolution can be justified when the basic norm underlying a Constitution disappears and a new system is put in its place.\nWhen revolution came then the old system will be replaced with new system\n\n===Asma Jilani vs Government of Punjab===\n\nIn the famous case of [[Asma Jahangir|Asma Jilani]], a detailed history of the Martial law in the British days has been mentioned and its comparison has been made with the past days. Two appeals were filed in the case, one by Miss Asma Jilani in the [[Lahore High Court|Punjab High Court]] for the release of her father Malik Ghulam Jilani, and the other by Mrs Zarina Gohar in the [[Sindh High Court]] for the release of her husband [[Altaf Gauhar|Altaf Gohar]] under Article 98 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|Constitution of Pakistan 1962]]. The detention of Malik Ghulam Jilani and Altaf Gohar had been made under the Martial Law Regulation No.78 of 1971 which was challenged in Lahore and Sindh High Courts respectively. Both the High Courts held that they had no jurisdiction over it because clause 2 of the Jurisdiction of Courts(Removal of Doubts) Order No.3 of 1969 barred the courts from questioning the validity of any act done under the Martial Law Regulation No.78 of 1971. Asma Jilani appealed to [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] where it was that this country was not a foreign country which had been invaded by any army with [[Yahya Khan|General Yahya khan]] as its head, nor was it an alien territory which had been occupied by the said army. Martial Law could not have arisen in the circumstances. [[Pakistan]] had its own legal doctrine, [[Quran|Holy Qur'an]] and the [[Objectives Resolution]]. Therefore, martial law was never superior to the Constitution. Supreme Court further held that Yahya khan was neither a victor nor Pakistan was an occupied territory and thus declared him a '[[usurper]]' and all his actions were also declared illegal. When Asma Jilani case's judgment was released, Yahya Khan was not in power and it was then Bhutto's Martial Law and he was the civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator and the President. Asma Jilani's case paved the way for the restoration of democracy in the country. This case was followed by the interim Constitution of 1972 and then by the permanent [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1973|Constitution of 1973]]. Due to the judicial pronouncement in the case of [[Asma Jahangir|Asma Jilani]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] was compelled to remove the Martial law.\n\n===Begum Nusrat Bhutto v. Chief of the Army Staff===\n\nOn November 10, 1977 the Supreme Court unanimously validated the imposition of martial law, under the doctrine of necessity. The law of necessity recognized and upheld by Pakistan's highest judicial body has proved an honorable protection for military adventure in civil government.it was the illegal action called law of necessity..\n\n===Haji Saifullah vs Federation of Pakistan===\n\nIn Federation of Pakistan v Saifullah Khan case, the Supreme Court,  held that the dismissal of Mohammad Khan Junejo's government by General Zia in May 1988 was unconstitutional but it refused to restore the National Assembly.\n\n===Ahmed Tariq Rahim v. Federation of Pakistan===\n\nOn 6 August 1990, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, under Article 58(2)(b) of the constitution, had dissolved the National Assembly and the government of Benazir Bhutto. The said dissolution order was challenged. The Supreme Court, by majority, upheld the dissolution of the National Assembly.\nReference P L D 1992 SC 646\n\n===Merham Ali vs Federation of Pakistan===\n\nDuring [[Nawaz Sharif]]'s government, the Supreme Court declared [[unconstitutional]] several [[anti-terrorism legislation#Pakistan|anti-terrorist laws]], including the 1997 Anti-Terrorism Act (which established [[Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan|Anti-Terrorism Courts]]) subsequently amended in October 1998 (''[[Merham Ali vs Federation of Pakistan]]'');<ref name=CKennedy>[[Charles Kennedy (political scientist)|Charles H.

The gas is then washed with [[water (molecule)|water]] and dried with sulfuric acid.\n\nTo conserve energy, the mixture is heated by exhaust gases from the [[catalytic heater|catalytic converter]] by heat exchangers.\n\nSulfur dioxide and dioxygen then react as follows:\n\n:2 SO<sub>2</sub><sub>(g)</sub> + O<sub>2</sub><sub>(g)</sub> \u21cc 2 SO<sub>3</sub><sub>(g)</sub> : \u0394''H'' = -197&nbsp;kJ\u00b7mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\n\nAccording to the [[Le Chatelier's principle]], a lower temperature should be used to shift the chemical equilibrium towards the right, hence increasing the percentage yield. However too low of a temperature will lower the formation rate to an uneconomical level. Hence to increase the reaction rate, high temperatures (450&nbsp;\u00b0C), medium pressures (1-2&nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]), and [[vanadium(V) oxide]] (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) are used to ensure an adequate (>95%) conversion. The catalyst only serves to increase the rate of reaction as it does not change the position of the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. The mechanism for the action of the catalyst comprises two steps:\n\n# Oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub> into SO<sub>3</sub> by V<sup>5+</sup>:\n#: 2SO<sub>2</sub> + 4V<sup>5+</sup> + 2O<sup>2\u2212</sup> \u2192 2SO<sub>3</sub> + 4V<sup>4+</sup>\n# Oxidation of V<sup>4+</sup> back into V<sup>5+</sup> by dioxygen (catalyst regeneration):\n#: 4V<sup>4+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 4V<sup>5+</sup> + 2O<sup>2\u2212</sup>\n\nHot sulfur trioxide passes through the heat exchanger and is dissolved in concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in the absorption tower to form [[oleum]]:\n\n: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (l) + SO<sub>3</sub> (g) \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (l)\n\nNote that directly dissolving SO<sub>3</sub> in water is impractical due to the highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] nature of the reaction. Acidic vapor or mists are formed instead of a liquid.\n\nOleum is reacted with water to form concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.\n\n:H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (l) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (l)\n\n== Purification unit ==\n\nThis includes the dusting tower, cooling pipes, scrubbers, drying tower, arsenic purifier and testing box. Sulfur dioxide has many impurities such as vapours, dust particles and arsenous oxide. Therefore, it must be purified to avoid catalyst poisoning (i.e.: destroying catalytic activity and loss of efficiency). In this process, the gas is washed with water, and dried by sulfuric acid. In the dusting tower, the sulfur dioxide is exposed to a steam which removes the dust particles. After the gas is cooled, the sulfur dioxide enters the washing tower where it is sprayed by water to remove any soluble impurities. In the drying tower, sulfuric acid is sprayed on the gas to remove the moisture from it. Finally, arsenic oxide is removed when the gas is exposed to ferric hydroxide.\n\n== DCDA ==\n\nThe next step to the Contact Process is DCDA or Double Contact Double Absorption. In this process the product gases (SO<sub>2</sub>) and (SO<sub>3</sub>) are passed through absorption towers twice to achieve further absorption and conversion of SO<sub>2</sub> to SO<sub>3</sub> and production of higher grade sulfuric acid.\n\nSO<sub>2</sub>-rich gases enter the catalytic converter, usually a tower with multiple catalyst beds, and are converted to SO<sub>3</sub>, achieving the first stage of conversion. The exit gases from this stage contain both SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub> which are passed through intermediate absorption towers where sulfuric acid is trickled down packed columns and SO<sub>3</sub> reacts with water increasing the sulfuric acid concentration. Though SO<sub>2</sub> too passes through the tower it is unreactive and comes out of the absorption tower.\n\nThis stream of gas containing SO<sub>2</sub>, after necessary cooling is passed through the catalytic converter bed column again achieving up to 99.8% conversion of SO<sub>2</sub> to SO<sub>3</sub> and the gases are again passed through the final absorption column thus resulting not only achieving high conversion efficiency for SO<sub>2</sub> but also enabling production of higher concentration of sulfuric acid.\n\nThe industrial production of sulfuric acid involves proper control of temperatures and flow rates of the gases as both the conversion efficiency and absorption are dependent on these.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lead chamber process]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''The Repertory of Patent Inventions'', no. 72 (April 1831), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EAcLAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA248#v=onepage&q&f=false page 248].\n* (Anon.)

{"title_page": "Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey", "text_new": "The 1934-1936 '''Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey''' (also called \"cards\") was an early demographic review of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the  United States]] and Canada. The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration. However intentional migration had been undertaken shortly after this time - the religion had only been present in a few states mostly in the Northeast to North Central and West Coast coming up to 1936 but a goal was set to spread the religion to every state by 1944. As it spread inward from the West coast this mere presence established recognizable proportional membership in the population while in the higher population of the South it did not. But there it did take root too, more so among the black communities along the coastal regions of the South. Indeed this wave of activity was undertaken during the first Seven Year Plan established by [[Shoghi Effendi]] which had the intranational goal of establishing a community in every state as well as establishing the religion in the countries of Latin America.\n\n==Development, context, and reviews of the Survey==\nThe 1934 American national convention affirmed the request of the national race amity committee for a survey of the racial makeup of the community affirming the request of the national amity committee work asking for localized amity committees and consolidation with concerned groups like the NAACP and Urban League.<ref name=GreenThesis>{{cite thesis |author=Jerome Green|date=2004 |title=Trial and Triumph: The Origins of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith in Black America |type=Senior Fellowship Thesis|publisher=Dartmouth College |oclc= 242842724 |url=http://bahai-library.com/green_bahai_black_america |access-date=Feb 9, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|p36}} The same year the national youth committee including [[Marion Holley]] recommended a census be taken of youth as well.<ref>{{cite magazine | title =Youth committee | magazine = Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed News | pages = 23\u20134 | date = May 1934|issue= 74 | url = http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&page=601 | access-date =Dec 29, 2017}}</ref> The Survey developed included historical information of the respondent - the date and place they were born, the date and place they joined the religion, and where they were living at the time of the Survey as well as their national and religious background.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p66}}\n\nThe Survey was widespread by the summer of 1935.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p37}} The complete collection of respondents is a little unclear.

Those three communities were significantly different:<ref name=StockmanThD/> Kenosha was mostly Scandinavians and Germans, with mostly early converts being 1st generation immigrants, Chicago started with half American followed by English and German and added a significant black proportion of the community after 1921, and in New York the community identified as mostly American then English, and then added a proportion of German. His analysis also showed broadly similar patterns in the communities of Christian or Protestant groups which started out a dominant group and dropped percentage-wise approaching 1936 while those raised as Bah\u00e1'\u00eds kept increasing with a couple small groups non-Protestants, (Catholics, Jews, or metaphysical groups) adding in as well: it started out more Protestant than the US in general but became more diverse than the US in general.<ref name=StockmanThD/>\n\nHampson analyzed the Survey and Census results relative to the states that had a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed population, a minority of the states mostly in the upper mid-West to the Northeast and California, and compared the racial and religious groups for just those states. He argued that the rate of black declarants in those states was much higher than being proportional to the black population of those states, indeed their rate of affiliation with the religion was above that of the rate of white presence in those states,<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp333-5}} and, though fewer of the Survey respondents were sufficiently particular about their religious background, agreed they were mostly from a Protestant background with the refinement that the contribution of the Unitarians was well above that of their proportion of their presence in those states and above that of all other protestant denominations though Episcopalian and Congregational were nearly tied for a distant second.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp338-342}} The lowest rate of religious backgrounds relative to their population in the states with significant Bah\u00e1'\u00eds presence were those of Jewish and Catholic backgrounds.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p340}} However Stockman characterizes these groups as contributing significantly to the religious diversity of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community,<ref name=stockmanv25n3/> and Smith also that in other surveys at other times Jews showed a significantly higher percentage of some communities.<ref name=BFitW-Smith/>{{rp|pp49-50}}\n\nHampson was able to do a county-by-county analysis including of earlier times.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p274}} By 1919 most Bah\u00e1'\u00ed communities had less than two dozen adults and many were an isolated group or individual.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p185}} By 1925 the Faith was in about 50 counties - about 2% - and almost all major urban centers in the Northeast and West Coast excepting Denver, Omaha, Atlanta, Augusta, Miami, and St. Augustine.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p276}} Hampson argued that unity struggles to accept leadership circa 1921-1925 showed some areas lost membership compared to before - only the early cores of communities by 1906 maintained their community populations.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp276-7}} From 1925 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds diffused into nearby regions with infilling and coalescence which favored local spread of the religion while the First Seven Year Plan was the one that established wider diffusion than just in the Northeast and West.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p277}} Those national goals were fulfilled in major urban centers.

Illinois and Wisconsin also held steady with both had heavy immigration and emigration. Hampson also observed that most of the migration that occurred was far and westward and little close and southward.

following a religious search often away from the mainstreams<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p161}} - Smith observed that during 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s tour in America in general and at Greenacre featured meetings with such groups, and the presence of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed membership in the Chicago New Thought Executive Committee.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp162-3}} But this group also had a strain with the anti-individualistic approach to the religious priority of its leadership before 1919,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p164}} and led to an ambivalent co-existent relationship until there were greater tensions later.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p165}} There were new patterns of authority sanctioned while old methods of authority were rejected. Tolerance for non-scriptural practices was allowed but not endorsed albeit some were opposed like the belief in reincarnation. Some of these beliefs that were specifically opposed continued anyway but opposition to claims of personal authority was a greater issue - there were claims of individual conscience and special powers.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p167}} However no process of these claims led to recognized authority in the religion though sometimes lasting or widespread recognition did exist and did lead to cliques and confusions.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p168}} Secret meeting circles occurred which may have been largest in the case of W. H. Harmon who personally revered 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and associated with the community and teachings but did not join the community.

The 1918 convention was meticulously reviewed for delegate credentials and the convention approved the committee's findings.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp190-1}}\n\nSmith characterized the religious liberalism component of the white population's religious background as having arose out of protestant transformation toward social Christianity between the Civil War and WWI and it was itself opposed by a rise of fundamentalism.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p170}} The liberalism motivations made repeated statements of inclusiveness of ideas, to add to one\u2019s belief from other places, other religions, an approach of being \u201cleaven rather than a cult\u201d and a challenge \"to be more true to what is deepest in their faith\u201d<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp171-2}} while upholding the singular authority of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h followed by 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and not break ties with previous religious affiliations and even used their presence in them to present Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ideas to them.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p173}} The ambiguous liberalism had strains in relation to the Faith being a distinct set of principles.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p174}} The liberalism emphasized a \u201clive the life\u201d pattern of action and sometimes as collective action. Smith notes peace organizations and race issues seeming to be the broadest efforts associated with this mindset of previous thinking and many audiences occurred of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds with organizations of like mind:<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p175}} NAACP, Bowery Mission, Jane Addams Hull House but also volunteers to the League of Nations to enforce peace though how to proceed was not agreed.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p177}} \n\n'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s personal standing among many was combined with his personal style of tolerance and gradualism though this leveraged peaceable if opposition to existing worldly authority.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p181}} In Britain the appreciation of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was less of a high station <ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p182}} and the Americans offended the Londoners with their acts of personal devotion.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp181-2}} Nevertheless the primacy of `Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 of whatever appreciation was a unifying factor in the American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed experience and rose in time in the form of an understanding of the [[Lesser Covenant]] against the challenges of other points of view.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p183}}\n\n==After 1936==\nDuring the first Seven Year Plan, 1936-1944, 153 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds moved among the goal areas in America that succeeded in electing assemblies - an average of 6 per goal area.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp269-70}} A few local residents must have joined in - and in some areas more and in some areas less.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p270}} An additional 10 moved to areas that did not elect an assembly by 1944, another 42 moved to areas in Canada and Alaska and 24 moved to areas that became jeopardized.

The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration. However intentional migration had been undertaken shortly after this time - the religion had only been present in a few states mostly in the Northeast to North Central and West Coast coming up to 1936 but a goal was set to spread the religion to every state by 1944. As it spread inward from the West coast this mere presence established recognizable proportional membership in the population while in the higher population of the South it did not. But there it did take root too, more so among the black communities along the coastal regions of the South. Indeed this wave of activity was undertaken during the first Seven Year Plan established by [[Shoghi Effendi]] which had the intranational goal of establishing a community in every state as well as establishing the religion in the countries of Latin America.\n\n==Development, context, and reviews of the Survey==\nThe 1934 American national convention affirmed the request of the national race amity committee for a survey of the racial makeup of the community affirming the request of the national amity committee work asking for localized amity committees and consolidation with concerned groups like the NAACP and Urban League.<ref name=GreenThesis>{{cite thesis |author=Jerome Green|date=2004 |title=Trial and Triumph: The Origins of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith in Black America |type=Senior Fellowship Thesis|publisher=Dartmouth College |oclc= 242842724 |url=http://bahai-library.com/green_bahai_black_america |access-date=Feb 9, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|p36}} The same year the national youth committee including [[Marion Holley]] recommended a census be taken of youth as well.<ref>{{cite magazine | title =Youth committee | magazine = Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed News | pages = 23\u20134 | date = May 1934|issue= 74 | url = http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&page=601 | access-date =Dec 29, 2017}}</ref> The Survey developed included historical information of the respondent - the date and place they were born, the date and place they joined the religion, and where they were living at the time of the Survey as well as their national and religious background.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p66}}\n\nThe Survey was widespread by the summer of 1935.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p37}} The complete collection of respondents is a little unclear.

His analysis also showed broadly similar patterns in the communities of Christian or Protestant groups which started out a dominant group and dropped percentage-wise approaching 1936 while those raised as Bah\u00e1'\u00eds kept increasing with a couple small groups non-Protestants, (Catholics, Jews, or metaphysical groups) adding in as well: it started out more Protestant than the US in general but became more diverse than the US in general.<ref name=StockmanThD/>\n\nHampson analyzed the Survey and Census results relative to the states that had a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed population, a minority of the states mostly in the upper mid-West to the Northeast and California, and compared the racial and religious groups for just those states.

millenaries<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p155}} (especially Adventism<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p156}}), metaphysical esotericism and quest (especially the search going through Christian Science, New Thought and Theosophy,)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp162-3}}), religious liberalism(its inclusiveness,)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p171}} having a sense of a need for social reconstruction,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p179}} and personal attachment to 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 (usually as the presence of the Christ spirit or more<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp182-3}} which transformed into an appreciation of the Covenant<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p179}}.) \n\nSmith supported the millenaries group by anecdotally referring to several individuals, publications, and Greenacre reports and the advent issues featured in discussions of 1914 and 1917 though not generally circulated.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp156-7}} Many presentations limited the unveiling of the ideas of [[End time]] era with the quick arrival at its conclusion without \"apocalyptic horrors\u201d but was referenced in 1914, linked with the Christian Era year 70 and destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple with the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Era 70( which was in 1914.)<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p158}} This was added to with optimism that peace would be the natural consequence of the war period and according to one report was the key discussion of the national convention.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p159}} Smith described the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed sense of millenarianism as more on the side of post-millenarianism theology, looking for a present active reconstruction of society, and that Bah\u00e1'\u00eds definitely had some [[Adventism]] mixed in as well.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p160}}\n\nFor the metaphysical movement being an appreciable part of the religious background of the white Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, especially New Thought and Theosophy - following a religious search often away from the mainstreams<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p161}} - Smith observed that during 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s tour in America in general and at Greenacre featured meetings with such groups, and the presence of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed membership in the Chicago New Thought Executive Committee.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp162-3}} But this group also had a strain with the anti-individualistic approach to the religious priority of its leadership before 1919,<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p164}} and led to an ambivalent co-existent relationship until there were greater tensions later.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p165}} There were new patterns of authority sanctioned while old methods of authority were rejected. Tolerance for non-scriptural practices was allowed but not endorsed albeit some were opposed like the belief in reincarnation. Some of these beliefs that were specifically opposed continued anyway but opposition to claims of personal authority was a greater issue - there were claims of individual conscience and special powers.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p167}} However no process of these claims led to recognized authority in the religion though sometimes lasting or widespread recognition did exist and did lead to cliques and confusions.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p168}} Secret meeting circles occurred which may have been largest in the case of W.

The 1918 convention was meticulously reviewed for delegate credentials and the convention approved the committee's findings.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp190-1}}\n\nSmith characterized the religious liberalism component of the white population's religious background as having arose out of protestant transformation toward social Christianity between the Civil War and WWI and it was itself opposed by a rise of fundamentalism.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p170}} The liberalism motivations made repeated statements of inclusiveness of ideas, to add to one\u2019s belief from other places, other religions, an approach of being \u201cleaven rather than a cult\u201d and a challenge \"to be more true to what is deepest in their faith\u201d<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp171-2}} while upholding the singular authority of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h followed by 'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 and not break ties with previous religious affiliations and even used their presence in them to present Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ideas to them.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p173}} The ambiguous liberalism had strains in relation to the Faith being a distinct set of principles.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p174}} The liberalism emphasized a \u201clive the life\u201d pattern of action and sometimes as collective action. Smith notes peace organizations and race issues seeming to be the broadest efforts associated with this mindset of previous thinking and many audiences occurred of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds with organizations of like mind:<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p175}} NAACP, Bowery Mission, Jane Addams Hull House but also volunteers to the League of Nations to enforce peace though how to proceed was not agreed.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p177}} \n\n'Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1\u2019s personal standing among many was combined with his personal style of tolerance and gradualism though this leveraged peaceable if opposition to existing worldly authority.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p181}} In Britain the appreciation of 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was less of a high station <ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p182}} and the Americans offended the Londoners with their acts of personal devotion.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|pp181-2}} Nevertheless the primacy of `Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 of whatever appreciation was a unifying factor in the American Bah\u00e1'\u00ed experience and rose in time in the form of an understanding of the [[Lesser Covenant]] against the challenges of other points of view.<ref name=SmithStudiesv1/>{{rp|p183}}\n\n==After 1936==\nDuring the first Seven Year Plan, 1936-1944, 153 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds moved among the goal areas in America that succeeded in electing assemblies - an average of 6 per goal area.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|pp269-70}} A few local residents must have joined in - and in some areas more and in some areas less.<ref name=HampsonPhD/>{{rp|p270}} An additional 10 moved to areas that did not elect an assembly by 1944, another 42 moved to areas in Canada and Alaska and 24 moved to areas that became jeopardized.

When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\".

According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament.

Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field.

Argentina was finally thrashed by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 6\u20131, one of the worst defeats of a national team in a World Cup and being eliminated from the competition.

The team thrashed Chile 6\u20131 at the debut, then beat Bolivia 2\u20130, Peru and Paraguay 3\u20131, Uruguay 4\u20131 and finished with a 1\u20131 draw against Brazil. Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team. Argentina made a poor performance at the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], being defeated by England (3\u20131) to be eliminated from the tournament.\n\nIn the [[1963 South American Championship]], Argentina finished third in the tournament, although the team achieved important victories over Brazil (3\u20130), Ecuador and Colombia, but lost to Bolivia and Peru. That same year, Argentina was also defeated by Brazil in the Roca Cup.\n\n===Nation's Cup===\n[[File:Seleccion argentina 1964.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The team that won the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]] in 1964]]\nIn 1964, Argentina won the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]], a friendly tournament organized by the Brazilian Association to commemorate its 50th anniversary.

Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England. Argentina only drew the first two games and was defeated in the last in Torino.\n\n[[File:Argentina 1966 rattin.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] (#10) was sent off by referee Kreitlein in the match against England.]]\nArgentina made its debut in Group 2 of the World Cup, defeating [[Spain national football team|Spain]] by 2\u20131. The next matches were against West Germany, which ended 0\u20130 and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] also won by 2\u20131. Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave. As a way to show his disgust, he sat on the red carpet exclusively meant for the Queen to walk on. He eventually had to be escorted from the field by two policemen and as a final sign of disgust, wrinkled at a British pennant before being escorted out. This incident, and others surrounding the same game, arguably started the long-lasting rivalry between both national teams, although on the other hand, allowed for the institution of yellow and red cards into football, a solution devised by FIFA after the spark that set off the incident.\n\nAlthough Argentina did not have a great performance in England, the players were well received by the crowd in Ezeiza, in part due to the incident with Ratt\u00edn and the Queen's carpet, where Ratt\u00edn himself later saying that he \"didn't know where he had sat on\".<ref name=transition>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7861%3Ala-transicion-hacia-la-organizacion&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"La transici\u00f3n hacia la organizaci\u00f3n\", AFA website: Historia de la Selecci\u00f3n Argentina]</ref>\n\nThe next step for the team was the [[1967 South American Championship|1967 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], hosted by Uruguay. Argentina made a good campaign, winning five over six matches disputed, being defeated only by the host team and finished second.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1969, the Football Association named four different coaches to the national team: Carmelo Faraone, who only coached two matches, [[Renato Cesarini]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Minella|Jos\u00e9 M. Minella]], [[Humberto Maschio]] and [[Adolfo Pedernera]]. In those years, Argentina played a series of friendly matches with most of them being South American teams and a few European teams. Argentina also played a new edition of the [[Copa Lipton|Lipton Cup]], obtaining it by goal average over Uruguay.\n\nIn 1969, Argentina began qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] under Pedernera. The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.  This poor performance that caused the absence of a national representative in the 1970 World Cup is still regarded as one of Argentina's biggest frustrations in its history.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-40394-2004-08-31.html \"A 35 a\u00f1os de un fat\u00eddico empate contra los peruanos\", ''P\u00e1gina/12''], August 31, 2004</ref>\n\nAfter the frustration of 1969, the Association named [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Pizzuti]], who had won the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] with [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] three years before, as coach of the national team. Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130).

Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win.

On 25 June 1978, at River Plate's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina played its second World Cup final. Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead in the 38th minute, with the Dutch squad able to respond in the 82nd minute for the equalizer. The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Maradona scored his first goal for the Senior team against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], where Argentina won 3\u20131.<ref>[http://blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html \"A 30 a\u00f1os del primer gol de Maradona\", DeporTEA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023934/http://www.blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, 2 June 2009</ref>\n\nThe highlight of 1979 was the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship]] obtained by the [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 team]] in [[Tokyo]]. The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship.

Bilardo was famous for his perfectionism and obsession with tactic and strategy of the game, which called the attention as much as followers as critics. The Bilardo era began in May 1983 with a 2\u20132 draw with Chile in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Soon after Argentina played the [[1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the first official tournament with Bilardo. The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

Some journalists also accused Bilardo to play defensively, leaving behind the historic Argentine landmark of short passes and dribblings according to their point of view. ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v. [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at the Estadio Olimpico Universitario in Mexico City.]]\nArgentina entered the 1986 World Cup with hope because of one player, Diego Maradona. Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw. The last group game was against Bulgaria, which resulted in a 2\u20130 Argentina win; therefore Argentina passed to the next round being the first in the group.\n\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=My daughter Daniela could not be called by her last name.

The hot-tempered game ended in a 1\u20130 win for Argentina. Next, Argentina moved on to the quarter-finals, playing England at the [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]]. The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130). This result caused a great surprise in Argentina<ref>[http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/20284/sorpresa-mundial-italia-1990-camerun-vence-argentina-1-0 \"Sorpresa en Mundial Italia 1990: Camer\u00fan vence a Argentina\"  - Generacion.com], 8 June 2010</ref> so the national team line-up was based on the 1986 world champion.\n\n[[File:Caniggia scoring v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Claudio Caniggia]] scoring the only goal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Turin]].]]\nArgentina won its second match against the Soviet Union 2\u20130 (where titular goalkeeper was [[Nery Pumpido]] seriously injured, being replaced by [[Sergio Goycochea]] for the rest of the tournament), and drew 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match of first round, both played in [[Naples]], where Maradona played for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples. The local host was considered favourite to win the match because their striker [[Salvatore Schillaci]] was the tournament's top scorer (he would be awarded both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the end of the tournament) and  Argentina had many injured players, Maradona being one of them. Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players. Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=260625&IdxSeccion=0 \"La pol\u00e9mica alemana sobre el penal en la final de Italia 90\"], ''Infobae'', 16 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/10/26/final-italia-1990-alemania-1-0-argentina/ \"Final Italia 1990: Alemania 1-0 Argentina\" -GeoFutbol.com]</ref>\n\nThe 1986 champion side could not repeat the high performances made four years prior, most notably Maradona, who played all the tournament injured.

In Buenos Aires, Argentina defeated Peru 2\u20131, drew with Paraguay 0\u20130 and suffered a catastrophic loss to Colombia 5\u20130 on 5 September 1993 in the Estadio Monumental. It became the largest defeat to a national team since a 1\u20136 result in the 1958 World Cup. Colombia, with great players such as [[Carlos Valderrama]], [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Leonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1965)|Leonel \u00c1lvarez]] not only won the qualifiers unbeaten, but sent Argentina to play against the representative of [[Oceania]] to get a place for the World Cup.<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/0000/00/00/C-995-colombia-93.php \"Colombia 93\"], ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]''</ref>\n\nThe most important sports magazine of Argentina, ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]'', went into \"mourning\" with a completely black cover with the only legend: \"''Verg\u00fcenza''\" (\"Shame\") that expressed the deception and humiliation after the defeat.<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/edicion_impresa.php?fh=1&tipo_edicion=1#anchorTapa ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' #3857, 7 September 1993]</ref><ref>[http://damepelota.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/15-argentina0-colombia5/ \"A 15 a\u00f1os de Argentina 0-Colombia 5\" by Pablo Lisotto], 5 September 2008</ref>\n\nArgentina had to play two knockout games against Australia to earn a place at the World Cup. Basile asked Maradona to return to the national squad so the team needed him to qualify to the Cup. Maradona agreed and he flew to [[Sydney]] with the rest of the team.<ref>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/671999-Basile-le-pedia-al-10-volver-a-la-Seleccion-para-clasificar-al-Mundial-94.html \"Basile le ped\u00eda al '10' volver a la Selecci\u00f3n\", PlayFutbol], 23 September 2012</ref> Argentina played the first game on 31 October 1993 which ended 1\u20131. The second match was in Buenos Aires, where the national team won 1\u20130 (Batistuta) qualifying for the World Cup.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-168711-2011-05-24.html \"Un caf\u00e9 veloz y a la Justicia\"], ''[[P\u00e1gina/12]]'', 24 May 2011</ref>\n\n===Another hard time: USA '94===\nArgentina played several friendly matches as preparation for the World Cup. The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.

It was a cup organized by both Argentine and Uruguayan Football Associations, with its last edition being contested in 1992. The first official title won by Argentina was the 1906 Copa Lipton, defeating Uruguay 2\u20130 in [[Montevideo]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/lipton.html Copa Lipton 1905-1992 at RSSSF]</ref> That same year, Argentina also played the [[Newton Cup]], another competition organized by both associations, earning the trophy after defeating Uruguay 2\u20131 in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn the following years, matches played by the Argentine side were against South American teams only. The reasons varied from the long time the trips took to another countries by then to [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7857%3Aseleccion-nacional-los-comienzos&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"AFA: los comienzos (1901-1930)\", AFA official site]</ref>\n\nArgentina would win four consecutive Newton Cups from 1907 to 1911,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/newton.html Copa Newton 1906-1976 at RSSSF]</ref> and four Lipton Cups from 1906 to 1909.

The host plus Brazil, Chile and Uruguay were the only teams contesting the inaugural competition. During that tournament Argentina played three matches, defeating Chile 6\u20130 and drawing Brazil and Uruguay, who became champions on goal difference. The line-up at the final was: Isola, D\u00edaz, Reyes, Mart\u00ednez, Olazar, Badaracco, Heissinger, [[Alberto Ohaco|Ohaco]], H. Hayes, E. Hayes and [[Natalio Perinetti|Perinetti]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/16safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\nArgentina won its first South American championship in 1921, also held in Buenos Aires. The squad won all the games disputed, defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and Uruguay to earn six points with no goals received. Notable players of that team were goalkeeper [[Am\u00e9rico Tesoriere]] and striker [[Pedro Calomino]]. Julio Libonatti was also tournament's top scorer.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/21safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\n===The Olympic goal===\n[[File:Gololimpicodeonzari.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Onzari's olympic goal against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1924.]]\n\nIn 1924, Argentina played a friendly match against Uruguay at [[Sportivo Barracas]]' stadium. When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\". This denomination still remains.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/10/02/deportes/d-07101.htm \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 80\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 2 October 2004</ref>\n\nThe goal stood since [[FIFA]] had previously regulated goals scored directly from the corner kick, as Onzari did during that match. According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament. It was the third South American title for the Argentina national team.\n\n===1928 Summer Olympics===\n{{Main|Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Argentina Olympic football team}}\n[[File:Argentina football team Olympics 1928.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The team that reached the final of the 1928 Summer Olympics.]]\n\nIn 1928, Argentina went to Amsterdam to play the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], which was the first international tournament played by the national team in its history. The football squad reached the final after trashing the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 11\u20132, Belgium 6\u20133 and Egypt 6\u20130.

Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (3\u20130), Paraguay (4\u20131) and Uruguay in the last match played in the [[Estadio Gas\u00f3metro]] of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field. Argentina was trashed [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] (8\u20132), [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3\u20130), Uruguay (4\u20130), Chile (6\u20132) and Brazil (3\u20130). The team was defeated by Peru in the last game but won the tournament due to finishing first in its group. The attacking line, formed by [[Oreste Corbatta]], [[Humberto Maschio]], [[Antonio Valent\u00edn Angelillo|Antonio Angelillo]], [[Omar S\u00edvori]] and [[Osvaldo H\u00e9ctor Cruz|Osvaldo Cruz]], was widely praised by then, being still remembered by the media and football fans.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm \"Los Carasucias: la gloria cumple 50 a\u00f1os\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014055858/http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm |date=2013-10-14 }}, ''Clar\u00edn'', 3 April 2007</ref> Maschio was also the topscorer with 9 goals.\n\nArgentina returned to a World Cup competition after 24 years, more precisely to the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] held in Sweden. The team suffered the absence of Maschio, Angelillo and S\u00edvori (playing in the [[Serie A|Italian first division]] but not called by St\u00e1bile for the tournament<ref>[http://www.misionmundial.com.ar/historia/Bocha-Maschio-generacion-perdida_0_254974576.html \"El Bocha Maschio y la generaci\u00f3n perdida\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002451/http://www.misionmundial.com.ar/historia/Bocha-Maschio-generacion-perdida_0_254974576.html |date=2013-12-03 }}, ''Misi\u00f3n Mundial'', 4 May 2010</ref>), who had made outstanding performances in Lima one year before. Although the squad was formed with valued players, the lack of experience facing European squads was evidenced once the tournament finished. Argentina lost to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 3\u20131 in the first game, though they came back to defeat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in the second match. Argentina was finally thrashed by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 6\u20131, one of the worst defeats of a national team in a World Cup and being eliminated from the competition. The poor performance was called \"''El desastre de Suecia''\" (\"The Sweden disaster\").

The team thrashed Chile 6\u20131 at the debut, then beat Bolivia 2\u20130, Peru and Paraguay 3\u20131, Uruguay 4\u20131 and finished with a 1\u20131 draw against Brazil. Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team.

Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England.

Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave.

The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.

Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130).

Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history. Nevertheless, other journalists assert that there were too many offensive midfielders.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%C2%B478/ |title=\"Maradona y el Mundial 78\" |access-date=2012-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022131351/http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%c2%b478/ |archive-date=2013-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passarella world cup.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Team captain [[Daniel Passarella]] holding the World Cup trophy.]]\nArgentina finally debuted on 2 June 1978 against Hungary, winning 2\u20131.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win. Argentina was able to edge out Brazil in the group and went on to the final. Argentina had to beat Peru by four goals or more to progress.

On 25 June 1978, at River Plate's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina played its second World Cup final. Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead in the 38th minute, with the Dutch squad able to respond in the 82nd minute for the equalizer. The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Maradona scored his first goal for the Senior team against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], where Argentina won 3\u20131.<ref>[http://blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html \"A 30 a\u00f1os del primer gol de Maradona\", DeporTEA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023934/http://www.blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, 2 June 2009</ref>\n\nThe highlight of 1979 was the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship]] obtained by the [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 team]] in [[Tokyo]]. The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship. Maradona could not show his skills during the tournament, suffering from the rough play of rivals (especially [[Claudio Gentile]] in the game against Italy). He would eventually be sent off by the referee after kicking Brazilian player [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]] in the groin.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7863%3Auna-alegria-y-un-golpe-inesperado&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Una alegr\u00eda y un golpe inesperado (1979/1982)\", AFA official website]</ref><ref>[http://www.marca.com/reportajes/2010/04/espana_1982/2010/04/19/seccion_01/1271693378.html \"Maradona fue mundialista por primera vez en Espa\u00f1a\" by Javier Estepa], ''Marca''</ref>\n\nOther players that formed the squad were [[Juan Barbas]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]] (from the 1979 youth championship-winning team), [[Patricio Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]], [[Enzo Trossero]] and [[Jorge Valdano]].\n\nThe failure at the World Cup caused Menotti to leave his post. Despite the poor performances, the national team achieved two world titles (senior and youth) during the nine years with Menotti as coach.

Bilardo was famous for his perfectionism and obsession with tactic and strategy of the game, which called the attention as much as followers as critics. The Bilardo era began in May 1983 with a 2\u20132 draw with Chile in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Soon after Argentina played the [[1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the first official tournament with Bilardo. The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v.

Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw.

The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130). This result caused a great surprise in Argentina<ref>[http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/20284/sorpresa-mundial-italia-1990-camerun-vence-argentina-1-0 \"Sorpresa en Mundial Italia 1990: Camer\u00fan vence a Argentina\"  - Generacion.com], 8 June 2010</ref> so the national team line-up was based on the 1986 world champion.\n\n[[File:Caniggia scoring v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Claudio Caniggia]] scoring the only goal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Turin]].]]\nArgentina won its second match against the Soviet Union 2\u20130 (where titular goalkeeper was [[Nery Pumpido]] seriously injured, being replaced by [[Sergio Goycochea]] for the rest of the tournament), and drew 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match of first round, both played in [[Naples]], where Maradona played for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples. The local host was considered favourite to win the match because their striker [[Salvatore Schillaci]] was the tournament's top scorer (he would be awarded both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the end of the tournament) and  Argentina had many injured players, Maradona being one of them. Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players. Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=260625&IdxSeccion=0 \"La pol\u00e9mica alemana sobre el penal en la final de Italia 90\"], ''Infobae'', 16 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/10/26/final-italia-1990-alemania-1-0-argentina/ \"Final Italia 1990: Alemania 1-0 Argentina\" -GeoFutbol.com]</ref>\n\nThe 1986 champion side could not repeat the high performances made four years prior, most notably Maradona, who played all the tournament injured.

The national team played some friendly matches and tournaments such as the Stanley Rous Cup, where Argentina drew 2\u20132 with England at Wembley Stadium (after losing 0\u20132 after the first half).

Argentina won the tournament unbeaten, winning six of seven matches. [[Gabriel Batistuta]] was also the leading scorer of the Copa with six goals. Apart from Batistuta, Sergio Goycochea, [[Leonardo Astrada]], Claudio Caniggia, [[Diego Simeone]] (who wore the number 10 kit shirt), [[Dario Franco]], [[Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez|Leo Rodr\u00edguez]] were some of the most notable Argentine players.<ref name=recambio/>\n\nIn 1992, Argentina won the friendly tournament [[Kirin Cup]] (defeating [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]).

The team shared group with Colombia, Paraguay and Peru. Argentina won the first two as visitor to Peru (1\u20130 in Lima) and Paraguay (3\u20131 in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]) but lost to Colombia 2\u20131 in [[Barranquilla]]. In Buenos Aires, Argentina defeated Peru 2\u20131, drew with Paraguay 0\u20130 and suffered a catastrophic loss to Colombia 5\u20130 on 5 September 1993 in the Estadio Monumental. It became the largest defeat to a national team since a 1\u20136 result in the 1958 World Cup.

The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.
