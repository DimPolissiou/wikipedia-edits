He is voiced by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the [[Griffin family]], in a 15-minute [[Short film|short]] on December 20, 1998. Stewie was created and designed by MacFarlane himself, who was asked to pitch a [[Television pilot|pilot]] to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], based on [[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry & Steve'']], two [[Short film|shorts]] made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the greenlight, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \"[[Death Has a Shadow]]\".\n\nA highly [[wikt:precocious|precocious]] [[infant]] who acts as an [[adult]], Stewie began the series as a [[Megalomania|megalomaniacal]] [[sociopath]], initially obsessed with violence, [[matricide]] and [[world domination]]. He is the youngest child of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin]], and the youngest brother of [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]]. Over the duration of the series, particularly following the two episode arc \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\" and \"[[Lois Kills Stewie]]\", the violent aspects of Stewie's personality were toned down, and he has evolved into an eccentric, friendly and flamboyant scamp. He has also come to have a very close friendship with the family's [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] (whom he originally used to antagonize in the earliest episodes). Stewie is considered to be the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]] and has received numerous award accommodations from writers such as Jodiss Pierre.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23365 |title=Seth MacFarlane |date=January 26, 2005 |work=[[The A.V.

Highly literate and able to cite [[Popular culture|pop culture]] references that long predate his birth, Stewie is also entranced by [[Raffi]] and ''[[Teletubbies]]''. Stewie succumbs to other childish tendencies; he believes Peter has truly disappeared in a game of [[Peekaboo]], often has difficulties understanding the concept of [[shapes]], talks to his [[teddy bear]] Rupert as if he were alive, is overcome with laughter when [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] blows on his stomach;<ref name=\"s03e13\">{{cite episode | title = Emission Impossible | episodelink = Emission Impossible | series = Family Guy | serieslink = Family Guy | network = Fox | airdate = November 8, 2001 | season = 3 | number = 11 | minutes =}}</ref> and has no idea how to use a toilet. MacFarlane has stated that Stewie is meant to represent the general helplessness of an infant through the eyes of an adult. Per [[cartoon physics]], his ability to move objects of greater weight than himself is not surprising to other characters, nor is his ability to retrieve firearms from [[hammerspace]] or his ability to talk. According to \"[[Family Guy (season 16)|Don't Be a Dickens at Christmas]]\", he understands German (but cannot speak it), as his mother is of German descent and the Pewterschmidts (except Lois) speak it.\n\nStewie's mastery of [[physics]] and [[mechanical engineering]] are at a level of [[science fiction]]. He has constructed advanced [[Fighter aircraft|fighter-jets]], [[mind control]] devices, a [[weather control]] device, a [[teleportation]] device, robots, clones, a working [[Transporter (Star Trek)|Transporter device]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', [[time travel|time machines]], a Multiverse Transporter, a shrinking pod,<ref name=\"s01e04\">{{cite episode| title = Mind Over Murder| episodelink = Mind Over Murder| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]| airdate =April 25, 1999|season = 1| number = 4}}</ref> as well as an assortment of guns including lasers, rocket launchers, and crossbows.

As made clear in [[Death Has a Shadow|the pilot episode]], Stewie's matricidal tendencies are a result of Lois constantly (and unwittingly) thwarting his schemes, and so he desires to kill her to carry out his plans without her interference. In other, later episodes, Stewie engages in other violent or criminal acts, including [[robbery]], [[aggravated assault]], [[carjacking]],<ref>{{cite episode| title = Road to Rupert| episodelink = Road to Rupert| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = January 28, 2007| season = 5| number = 9}}</ref> [[loan shark]]ing,<ref>{{cite episode| title = Patriot Games| episodelink = Patriot Games (Family Guy)| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = January 29, 2006| season = 5| number = 20}}</ref> [[forgery]],<ref>{{cite episode| title = Back to the Woods| episodelink = Back to the Woods (Family Guy)| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = February 17, 2008| season = 6| number = 9}}</ref> and killing off many minor characters (with a tank, guns, and other assorted weaponry).<ref>{{cite episode| title = Saving Private Brian| episodelink = Saving Private Brian| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = November 5, 2006| season = 5| number = 4}}</ref>\n\nStewie eventually realizes his dreams of [[matricide]] and world domination in the sixth season two-part episode \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\" and \"[[Lois Kills Stewie]]\". The events are [[Status quo#Other Usages|reverted]] in a [[deus ex machina]] ending, where most of the story turns out to be a [[Reset button technique|computer simulation]].<!-- Expanded detail of these episodes belongs in the episode articles, not here. --> Because of the rather disastrous ending for himself in the simulation, being shot and killed by Peter, he decides to put aside his plans of [[matricide]] and world domination for the time being.\n\nStewie shows a complete disdain for most people, but does show affection and even rare instances of kindness to his family. Such moments include his support for Meg (whom he traditionally calls \"Megan\") as when he chided Brian's [[Cocaine|coke]]-induced hostility to her (\"[[The Thin White Line]]\"), retracted his joke, \"I hate you too, bitch\" when Meg said \"I hate you all\" to the family (\"[[Untitled Griffin Family History]]\"), and wiped her tears during a weepy moment. On a more frequent basis though, Stewie constantly disrespects Meg, as he does with most elders (and as most people do to Meg), often being rude to her and subjecting her to the malice of his misbehavior, once even tricking her outside to be attacked by bees on steroids.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Gronkowsbees|episodelink=Gronkowsbees|series=Family Guy|serieslink=Family Guy|network=Fox|airdate=2017-01-15|season=15|number=11}}</ref>\n\nHe generally thinks of Peter as an inferior\u2014regarding him simply as \"the fat man\" and, at one point, harboring doubts that Peter could possibly be his father (\"[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]\")\u2014but does bond with him over a shared love of practical jokes made at Lois' expense (\"[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]\"). While Stewie generally regards Chris as a stooge, he considers him his only friend aside from Brian, and even helped Chris to dress when he felt too shy to date (\"[[Extra Large Medium]]\") and assists him in dealing with bullies (\"[[Secondhand Spoke]]\"). In a few episodes, such as \"[[Stewie Loves Lois]]\", it is shown that Stewie can love his mother. In that episode, after Lois recovers and repairs a lost Rupert and serves Stewie a meal he likes, he rethinks Lois and accepts her as a loving mother. When he becomes too dependent on her, she deliberately takes no notice of him; when he hurts himself, she tries to show notice of him again, he returns to hating her. However, at the end of the season nine premiere, \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", when Diane Simmons is about to murder Lois for uncovering her murderous revenge scheme, Stewie secretly saves Lois by killing Diane with a sniper rifle, stating to himself: \"If anyone's going to take that bitch down, it's going to be me\", revealing that Stewie continues dreaming about killing Lois.\n\nIn the more recent seasons, Stewie has a larger amount of freedom from his parents, usually spending much of his time with [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. This extends to the point of him being able to keep pigs from parallel universes (\"[[Road to the Multiverse]]\") or take part in the television series ''Jolly Farm'' (\"[[Go Stewie Go]]\"), as compared to the first season, in which his plans were constantly hindered by [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]. In \"[[The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair]]\", Stewie inadvertently clones an evil twin of himself after trying to increase his evil nature. By the end of the episode, it is suggested that the original Stewie may have been unknowingly killed by Brian (as he cannot tell them apart) and Stewie turns to the camera with glowing yellow eyes (reminiscent of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\"). But so far, the Stewie recently seen in \"[[Trading Places (Family Guy)|Trading Places]]\", the follow-up episode, he still seems to have his mostly harmless eccentricity, shown when he asks Brian if he wants to trade places with him for fun. He also starts to interact with more people despite still having hatred towards many of them, as shown in cutaways in later episodes, and more flamboyant. Stewie is shown in more recent episodes to be a superfan of [[Taylor Swift]], and even sets her up with Chris as a prom date. Stewie has had a few rare interactions with his [[pedophile]] neighbor [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]. Stewie intensely dislikes him and is one of the few characters fully aware of Herbert's nature, even calling him a pervert to his face. All this does, however, is move Herbert into thinking Stewie as \"feisty\".\n\nIn \"[[Dog Bites Bear]]\", Stewie ranks the films in ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' franchise as follows.\n# ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]''\n# ''[[Fast Five]]''\n# ''[[Furious 7]]''\n# ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (which he says is controversial)\n# ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''\n# ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast and Furious]]''\n# ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]''\n\nThis is exactly how writer [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] ranks the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/14/family-guy-recap-rupert-dies-episode-300-interview/|title=Family Guy EP Talks [Spoiler]'s Death, Explains 300th Episode's Homage to The Fast and the Furious|website=[[TVLine]]|first=Andy|last=Swift|date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Family Guy (season 16)|season 16]] episode \"[[Send in Stewie, Please]]\", it is revealed that Stewie's English accent is fake and that he actually has an American Boston accent, although the follow up joke that has him speak in numerous other voices (of Seth MacFarlane's other characters) suggest it was a mere gag.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|[[Seth MacFarlane]] created and voices Stewie]]\n\nStewie's voice is provided by ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who also provides the voices of [[Brian Griffin]], [[Peter Griffin]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] as well as numerous other characters.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cartoonist MacFarlane funny guy of Fox's 'Family' Subversive voice of series is his|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Graham, Jefferson|date=January 29, 1999|page=E7}}</ref> MacFarlane based Stewie's accent on the voice of [[England|English]] actor [[Rex Harrison]],<ref name=\"foxnews\">{{cite news|first=John|last=Dean|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1042476/seth-macfarlane\u2019s-2-billion-family-guy-empire|title=Seth MacFarlane\u2019s $2 Billion Family Guy Empire|website=[[Fox Business]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corp]]|location=New York City|date=November 1, 2008|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"grahamnorton20140530\">{{cite episode | series=The Graham Norton Show | network=BBC | title=Episode 9 | airdate=May 30, 2014 | season=15 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b045cgtw }}</ref> particularly on Harrison's performance in the 1964 musical drama film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Nancy|last=Franklin|title=American Idiots|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 16, 2006}}</ref> MacFarlane has stated that his inspiration for the Stewie name was a car owned by [[Stan Lee]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5866904/in-1992-stan-lee-gave-todd-mcfarlane-and-rob-liefeld-20-minutes-to-invent-a-superhero/|title=In 1992, Stan Lee gave Todd McFarlane and Rob Liefeld 20 minutes to invent a superhero|last=Lamar|first=Cyriaque|work=io9|date=December 10, 2011|access-date=October 16, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> MacFarlane has also linked Stewie with [[David Hyde Pierce]] on more than one occasion, saying he wants Pierce to play Stewie if a live action version of the show would ever be created.<ref name=\"Advocate\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/biz/Successful-Guy-Seth-35180.aspx |title=Successful Guy Seth MacFarlane takes advantage of his hit status with a new comedy |work=[[TV Guide]] |author=Battaglio, Stephen |date=February 9, 2006 |accessdate=August 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014012612/http://www.tvguide.com/biz/Successful-Guy-Seth-35180.aspx |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nStewie's head has the [[Spheroid|shape of]] a [[Rugby football|rugby ball]].

When the writers began to flesh out Stewie's character beyond being a generic supervillain in season two, MacFarlane and the writers began to explore Stewie's sexuality with a series of one-off gags, which hinted in \"[[Chick Cancer]]\" and \"[[We Love You, Conrad]]\" that Stewie could be [[gay]]. One example is in the episode, \"[[Brian and Stewie]],\" where Stewie's cellphone screensaver is of a muscular man. Another is where he has a picture of [[Chris Noth]] in his wallet and he expresses his wishes to have sexual relations with Brian's son, Dylan. In some episodes, such as \"[[Turkey Guys]]\" and \"Send in Stewie, Please\", Stewie appears to be on the verge of [[coming out of the closet]] when he is interrupted for comedic effect.\n\nOn other occasions, such as when Stewie falls in love with a girl, Janet, in \"[[Dammit Janet!]]\", he has been shown to be [[Heterosexuality|straight]]. In the commentary for ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', the writers describe how they were going to make Stewie discover he was gay, but decided to scrap this idea in order to retain Stewie's sexual ambiguity for writing purposes. MacFarlane planned for the series' [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]] to end with Stewie coming out after a near-death experience. The show's abrupt cancellation caused MacFarlane to abort these plans, and the episode \"Queer Is Stewie?\" was actually produced, but never shown. Since that point, MacFarlane has opted to have Stewie portrayed as sexually ambiguous, as, in his eyes, the flexibility of Stewie's sexuality allows for much more freedom in terms of writing for the character.\nMacFarlane later elaborated:\n\n{{quote|\"He originally began as a diabolical villain, but then we delved into the idea of his confused sexuality. We all feel that Stewie is almost certainly gay, and he's in the process of figuring it out for himself. We haven't ever really locked into it because we get a lot of good jokes from both sides, but we treat him oftentimes as if we were writing a gay character.\"|Seth MacFarlane|\"Big Gay Following\", ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' interview<ref name=\"Advocate\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.advocate.com/issue_story.asp?id=51793&page=2 |title=BGF: Seth MacFarlane |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |last=Voss |first=Brandon |date=February 26, 2008|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |publisher=PlanetOut |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203181205/http://www.advocate.com/issue_story.asp?id=51793&page=2 |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}</ref>}}\n\nWhen asked why he made the decision \"to take Stewie from homicidal maniac to gay little song boy?,\" MacFarlane answered: \"It wasn't a conscious decision. Characters evolve in certain ways and we found that doing the take-over-the-world thing every week was getting played out and was starting to feel a little dated. It was weirdly feeling a little '90s and believe me, if we were still doing that, the show would be on its last legs. I only half-jokingly go by the guideline that, if it's something that might possibly ruin the show, it's a story we should probably do.\"<ref>{{cite web \n |title=Interview: Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane \n |url=http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04651833/interview_family_guy_creator_seth_macfarlane.html \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065632/http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04651833/interview_family_guy_creator_seth_macfarlane.html \n |archivedate=2009-01-14 \n }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sovo.com/2009/8-21/view/ontherecord/10493.cfm Sovo.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826115037/http://www.sovo.com/2009/8-21/view/ontherecord/10493.cfm |date=August 26, 2009 }} <!--  ??? --></ref>\n\nMacFarlane told ''[[Playboy]]'' \"We had an episode that went all the way to the script phase in which Stewie does come out.

But we decided it's better to keep it vague, which makes more sense because he's a one-year-old. Ultimately, Stewie will be gay or a very unhappy repressed heterosexual. It also explains why he's so hellbent on killing his mother, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] and taking over the world: he has a lot of aggression, which comes from confusion and uncertainty about his orientation.\"<ref name=gay>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/08/13/2009-08-13_seth_macfarlane_outs_baby_stewie_in_family_guy_hes_gay_macfarlane_says_in_playbo.html|title='Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane outs Stewie: Yes, he's gay|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=New York City|date=August 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nMacFarlane has been nominated for two awards for voicing Stewie Griffin.

He is voiced by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the [[Griffin family]], in a 15-minute [[Short film|short]] on December 20, 1998. Stewie was created and designed by MacFarlane himself, who was asked to pitch a [[Television pilot|pilot]] to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], based on [[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry & Steve'']], two [[Short film|shorts]] made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the greenlight, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \"[[Death Has a Shadow]]\".\n\nA highly [[wikt:precocious|precocious]] [[infant]] who acts as an [[adult]], Stewie began the series as a [[Megalomania|megalomaniacal]] [[sociopath]], initially obsessed with violence, [[matricide]] and [[world domination]]. He is the youngest child of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin]], and the youngest brother of [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] and [[Chris Griffin|Chris]]. Over the duration of the series, particularly following the two episode arc \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\" and \"[[Lois Kills Stewie]]\", the violent aspects of Stewie's personality were toned down, and he has evolved into an eccentric, friendly and flamboyant scamp. He has also come to have a very close friendship with the family's [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] (whom he originally used to antagonize in the earliest episodes). Stewie is considered to be the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]] and has received numerous award accommodations from writers such as Jodiss Pierre.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23365 |title=Seth MacFarlane |date=January 26, 2005 |work=[[The A.V.

Highly literate and able to cite [[Popular culture|pop culture]] references that long predate his birth, Stewie is also entranced by [[Raffi]] and ''[[Teletubbies]]''. Stewie succumbs to other childish tendencies; he believes Peter has truly disappeared in a game of [[Peekaboo]], often has difficulties understanding the concept of [[shapes]], talks to his [[teddy bear]] Rupert as if he were alive, is overcome with laughter when [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] blows on his stomach;<ref name=\"s03e13\">{{cite episode | title = Emission Impossible | episodelink = Emission Impossible | series = Family Guy | serieslink = Family Guy | network = Fox | airdate = November 8, 2001 | season = 3 | number = 11 | minutes =}}</ref> and has no idea how to use a toilet. MacFarlane has stated that Stewie is meant to represent the general helplessness of an infant through the eyes of an adult. Per [[cartoon physics]], his ability to move objects of greater weight than himself is not surprising to other characters, nor is his ability to retrieve firearms from [[hammerspace]] or his ability to talk. According to \"[[Family Guy (season 16)|Don't Be a Dickens at Christmas]]\", he understands German (but cannot speak it), as his mother is of German descent and the Pewterschmidts (except Lois) speak it.\n\nStewie's mastery of [[physics]] and [[mechanical engineering]] are at a level of [[science fiction]]. He has constructed advanced [[Fighter aircraft|fighter-jets]], [[mind control]] devices, a [[weather control]] device, a [[teleportation]] device, robots, clones, a working [[Transporter (Star Trek)|Transporter device]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', [[time travel|time machines]], a Multiverse Transporter, a shrinking pod,<ref name=\"s01e04\">{{cite episode| title = Mind Over Murder| episodelink = Mind Over Murder| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]| airdate =April 25, 1999|season = 1| number = 4}}</ref> as well as an assortment of guns including lasers, rocket launchers, and crossbows.

As made clear in [[Death Has a Shadow|the pilot episode]], Stewie's matricidal tendencies are a result of Lois constantly (and unwittingly) thwarting his schemes, and so he desires to kill her to carry out his plans without her interference. In other, later episodes, Stewie engages in other violent or criminal acts, including [[robbery]], [[aggravated assault]], [[carjacking]],<ref>{{cite episode| title = Road to Rupert| episodelink = Road to Rupert| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = January 28, 2007| season = 5| number = 9}}</ref> [[loan shark]]ing,<ref>{{cite episode| title = Patriot Games| episodelink = Patriot Games (Family Guy)| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = January 29, 2006| season = 5| number = 20}}</ref> [[forgery]],<ref>{{cite episode| title = Back to the Woods| episodelink = Back to the Woods (Family Guy)| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = February 17, 2008| season = 6| number = 9}}</ref> and killing off many minor characters (with a tank, guns, and other assorted weaponry).<ref>{{cite episode| title = Saving Private Brian| episodelink = Saving Private Brian| series = Family Guy| serieslink = Family Guy| network = Fox| airdate = November 5, 2006| season = 5| number = 4}}</ref>\n\nStewie eventually realizes his dreams of [[matricide]] and world domination in the sixth season two-part episode \"[[Stewie Kills Lois]]\" and \"[[Lois Kills Stewie]]\". The events are [[Status quo#Other Usages|reverted]] in a [[deus ex machina]] ending, where most of the story turns out to be a [[Reset button technique|computer simulation]].<!-- Expanded detail of these episodes belongs in the episode articles, not here. --> Because of the rather disastrous ending for himself in the simulation, being shot and killed by Peter, he decides to put aside his plans of [[matricide]] and world domination for the time being.\n\nStewie shows a complete disdain for most people, but does show affection and even rare instances of kindness to his family. Such moments include his support for Meg (whom he traditionally calls \"Megan\") as when he chided Brian's [[Cocaine|coke]]-induced hostility to her (\"[[The Thin White Line]]\"), retracted his joke, \"I hate you too, bitch\" when Meg said \"I hate you all\" to the family (\"[[Untitled Griffin Family History]]\"), and wiped her tears during a weepy moment. On a more frequent basis though, Stewie constantly disrespects Meg, as he does with most elders (and as most people do to Meg), often being rude to her and subjecting her to the malice of his misbehavior, once even tricking her outside to be attacked by bees on steroids.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Gronkowsbees|episodelink=Gronkowsbees|series=Family Guy|serieslink=Family Guy|network=Fox|airdate=2017-01-15|season=15|number=11}}</ref>\n\nHe generally thinks of Peter as an inferior\u2014regarding him simply as \"the fat man\" and, at one point, harboring doubts that Peter could possibly be his father (\"[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]\")\u2014but does bond with him over a shared love of practical jokes made at Lois' expense (\"[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]\"). While Stewie generally regards Chris as a stooge, he considers him his only friend aside from Brian, and even helped Chris to dress when he felt too shy to date (\"[[Extra Large Medium]]\") and assists him in dealing with bullies (\"[[Secondhand Spoke]]\"). In a few episodes, such as \"[[Stewie Loves Lois]]\", it is shown that Stewie can love his mother. In that episode, after Lois recovers and repairs a lost Rupert and serves Stewie a meal he likes, he rethinks Lois and accepts her as a loving mother. When he becomes too dependent on her, she deliberately takes no notice of him; when he hurts himself, she tries to show notice of him again, he returns to hating her. However, at the end of the season nine premiere, \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", when Diane Simmons is about to murder Lois for uncovering her murderous revenge scheme, Stewie secretly saves Lois by killing Diane with a sniper rifle, stating to himself: \"If anyone's going to take that bitch down, it's going to be me\", revealing that Stewie continues dreaming about killing Lois.\n\nIn the more recent seasons, Stewie has a larger amount of freedom from his parents, usually spending much of his time with [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. This extends to the point of him being able to keep pigs from parallel universes (\"[[Road to the Multiverse]]\") or take part in the television series ''Jolly Farm'' (\"[[Go Stewie Go]]\"), as compared to the first season, in which his plans were constantly hindered by [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]. In \"[[The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair]]\", Stewie inadvertently clones an evil twin of himself after trying to increase his evil nature. By the end of the episode, it is suggested that the original Stewie may have been unknowingly killed by Brian (as he cannot tell them apart) and Stewie turns to the camera with glowing yellow eyes (reminiscent of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\"). But so far, the Stewie recently seen in \"[[Trading Places (Family Guy)|Trading Places]]\", the follow-up episode, he still seems to have his mostly harmless eccentricity, shown when he asks Brian if he wants to trade places with him for fun. He also starts to interact with more people despite still having hatred towards many of them, as shown in cutaways in later episodes, and more flamboyant. Stewie is shown in more recent episodes to be a superfan of [[Taylor Swift]], and even sets her up with Chris as a prom date. Stewie has had a few rare interactions with his [[pedophile]] neighbor [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]. Stewie intensely dislikes him and is one of the few characters fully aware of Herbert's nature, even calling him a pervert to his face. All this does, however, is move Herbert into thinking Stewie as \"feisty\".\n\nIn \"[[Dog Bites Bear]]\", Stewie ranks the films in ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' franchise as follows.\n# ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]''\n# ''[[Fast Five]]''\n# ''[[Furious 7]]''\n# ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (which he says is controversial)\n# ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''\n# ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast and Furious]]''\n# ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]''\n\nThis is exactly how writer [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] ranks the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/14/family-guy-recap-rupert-dies-episode-300-interview/|title=Family Guy EP Talks [Spoiler]'s Death, Explains 300th Episode's Homage to The Fast and the Furious|website=[[TVLine]]|first=Andy|last=Swift|date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Family Guy (season 16)|season 16]] episode \"[[Send in Stewie, Please]]\", it is revealed that Stewie's English accent is fake and that he actually has an American Boston accent, although the follow up joke that has him speak in numerous other voices (of Seth MacFarlane's other characters) suggest it was a mere gag.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|[[Seth MacFarlane]] created and voices Stewie]]\n\nStewie's voice is provided by ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who also provides the voices of [[Brian Griffin]], [[Peter Griffin]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] as well as numerous other characters.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cartoonist MacFarlane funny guy of Fox's 'Family' Subversive voice of series is his|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Graham, Jefferson|date=January 29, 1999|page=E7}}</ref> MacFarlane based Stewie's accent on the voice of [[England|English]] actor [[Rex Harrison]],<ref name=\"foxnews\">{{cite news|first=John|last=Dean|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1042476/seth-macfarlane\u2019s-2-billion-family-guy-empire|title=Seth MacFarlane\u2019s $2 Billion Family Guy Empire|website=[[Fox Business]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corp]]|location=New York City|date=November 1, 2008|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"grahamnorton20140530\">{{cite episode | series=The Graham Norton Show | network=BBC | title=Episode 9 | airdate=May 30, 2014 | season=15 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b045cgtw }}</ref> particularly on Harrison's performance in the 1964 musical drama film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Nancy|last=Franklin|title=American Idiots|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 16, 2006}}</ref> MacFarlane has stated that his inspiration for the Stewie name was a car owned by [[Stan Lee]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5866904/in-1992-stan-lee-gave-todd-mcfarlane-and-rob-liefeld-20-minutes-to-invent-a-superhero/|title=In 1992, Stan Lee gave Todd McFarlane and Rob Liefeld 20 minutes to invent a superhero|last=Lamar|first=Cyriaque|work=io9|date=December 10, 2011|access-date=October 16, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> MacFarlane has also linked Stewie with [[David Hyde Pierce]] on more than one occasion, saying he wants Pierce to play Stewie if a live action version of the show would ever be created.<ref name=\"Advocate\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/biz/Successful-Guy-Seth-35180.aspx |title=Successful Guy Seth MacFarlane takes advantage of his hit status with a new comedy |work=[[TV Guide]] |author=Battaglio, Stephen |date=February 9, 2006 |accessdate=August 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014012612/http://www.tvguide.com/biz/Successful-Guy-Seth-35180.aspx |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nStewie's head has the [[Spheroid|shape of]] a [[Rugby football|rugby ball]].

When the writers began to flesh out Stewie's character beyond being a generic supervillain in season two, MacFarlane and the writers began to explore Stewie's sexuality with a series of one-off gags, which hinted in \"[[Chick Cancer]]\" and \"[[We Love You, Conrad]]\" that Stewie could be [[gay]]. One example is in the episode, \"[[Brian and Stewie]],\" where Stewie's cellphone screensaver is of a muscular man. Another is where he has a picture of [[Chris Noth]] in his wallet and he expresses his wishes to have sexual relations with Brian's son, Dylan. In some episodes, such as \"[[Turkey Guys]]\" and \"Send in Stewie, Please\", Stewie appears to be on the verge of [[coming out of the closet]] when he is interrupted for comedic effect.\n\nOn other occasions, such as when Stewie falls in love with a girl, Janet, in \"[[Dammit Janet!]]\", he has been shown to be [[Heterosexuality|straight]]. In the commentary for ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', the writers describe how they were going to make Stewie discover he was gay, but decided to scrap this idea in order to retain Stewie's sexual ambiguity for writing purposes. MacFarlane planned for the series' [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]] to end with Stewie coming out after a near-death experience. The show's abrupt cancellation caused MacFarlane to abort these plans, and the episode \"Queer Is Stewie?\" was actually produced, but never shown. Since that point, MacFarlane has opted to have Stewie portrayed as sexually ambiguous, as, in his eyes, the flexibility of Stewie's sexuality allows for much more freedom in terms of writing for the character.\nMacFarlane later elaborated:\n\n{{quote|\"He originally began as a diabolical villain, but then we delved into the idea of his confused sexuality. We all feel that Stewie is almost certainly gay, and he's in the process of figuring it out for himself. We haven't ever really locked into it because we get a lot of good jokes from both sides, but we treat him oftentimes as if we were writing a gay character.\"|Seth MacFarlane|\"Big Gay Following\", ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' interview<ref name=\"Advocate\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.advocate.com/issue_story.asp?id=51793&page=2 |title=BGF: Seth MacFarlane |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |last=Voss |first=Brandon |date=February 26, 2008|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |publisher=PlanetOut |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203181205/http://www.advocate.com/issue_story.asp?id=51793&page=2 |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}</ref>}}\n\nWhen asked why he made the decision \"to take Stewie from homicidal maniac to gay little song boy?,\" MacFarlane answered: \"It wasn't a conscious decision. Characters evolve in certain ways and we found that doing the take-over-the-world thing every week was getting played out and was starting to feel a little dated. It was weirdly feeling a little '90s and believe me, if we were still doing that, the show would be on its last legs. I only half-jokingly go by the guideline that, if it's something that might possibly ruin the show, it's a story we should probably do.\"<ref>{{cite web \n |title=Interview: Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane \n |url=http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04651833/interview_family_guy_creator_seth_macfarlane.html \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065632/http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04651833/interview_family_guy_creator_seth_macfarlane.html \n |archivedate=2009-01-14 \n }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sovo.com/2009/8-21/view/ontherecord/10493.cfm Sovo.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826115037/http://www.sovo.com/2009/8-21/view/ontherecord/10493.cfm |date=August 26, 2009 }} <!--  ??? --></ref>\n\nMacFarlane told ''[[Playboy]]'' \"We had an episode that went all the way to the script phase in which Stewie does come out. It had to do with the harassment he took from other kids at school. He ends up going back in time to prevent a passage in [[Leviticus]] from being written: 'Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind. It is an abomination.' But we decided it's better to keep it vague, which makes more sense because he's a one-year-old. Ultimately, Stewie will be gay or a very unhappy repressed heterosexual. It also explains why he's so hellbent on killing his mother, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] and taking over the world: he has a lot of aggression, which comes from confusion and uncertainty about his orientation.\"<ref name=gay>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/08/13/2009-08-13_seth_macfarlane_outs_baby_stewie_in_family_guy_hes_gay_macfarlane_says_in_playbo.html|title='Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane outs Stewie: Yes, he's gay|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=New York City|date=August 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nMacFarlane has been nominated for two awards for voicing Stewie Griffin.

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks.

To communicate, devices must use a common Wi-Fi version. The versions differ between the radio wavebands they operate on, the radio bandwidth they occupy, the maximum data rates they can support and other details. Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet access ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

As with all radio, this is done by the [[modem|modulating and demodulation]] of [[carrier wave]]s. Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314).

In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth.

These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]]. This means that nodes have an associated [[internet address]] and, with suitable connectivity, this allows full Internet access.\n\n===Modes===\n\n====Infrastructure====\n[[File:Wi-Fi.gif|thumb|Depiction of a Wi-Fi network in infrastructure mode. The device sends information wirelessly to another device, both connected to the local network, in order to print a document]]\nIn infrastructure mode, which is the most common mode used, all communications goes through a base station. For communications within the network, this introduces an extra use of the airwaves, but has the advantage that any two stations that can communicate with the base station can also communicate through the base station, which enormously simplifies the protocols.\n\n==== Ad hoc and Wi-Fi direct ====\nWi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary. This is called [[wireless ad hoc network|''ad hoc'' Wi-Fi transmission]]. Different types of ad hoc network exist. In the simplest case network nodes must talk directly to each other. In more complex protocols nodes may forward packets, and nodes keep track of how to reach other nodes, even if they move around.\n\nAd-hoc mode was first described by [[Chai Keong Toh]] in his 1996 patent<ref>{{Cite patent|country=US|number=5987011|title=Routing Method for Ad-Hoc Mobile Networks|status=|pubdate=November 16, 1999|gdate=|invent1=Toh|inventor1-first=Chai Keong|inventorlink=Chai Keong Toh}}</ref> of Wi-Fi ad-hoc routing, implemented on Lucent WaveLAN 802.11a wireless on IBM [[ThinkPad]]s over a size nodes scenario spanning a region of over a mile.

In addition, propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.\n\nAt longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.\n\n=== Transmitter power ===\nCompared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low power devices. In general, the maximum amount of power that a Wi-Fi device can transmit is limited by local regulations, such as [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC Part 15]] in the US. [[Equivalent isotropically radiated power]] (EIRP) in the European Union is limited to 20 [[dBm]] (100&nbsp;mW).\n\nTo reach requirements for wireless LAN applications, Wi-Fi has higher power consumption compared to some other standards designed to support wireless personal area network (PAN) applications. For example, Bluetooth provides a much shorter [[Radio propagation|propagation]] range between 1 and 100m<ref>{{cite web|url=https://janmagnet.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/comparison-ieee-802-standards.pdf|title=Comparison of the IEEE 802.11, 802.15.1,802.15.4, and 802.15.6 wireless standards|last=Tjensvold|first=Jan Magne|date=2007-09-18|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720054917/http://janmagnet.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/comparison-ieee-802-standards.pdf|archivedate=2013-07-20|url-status=live|accessdate=2013-04-26}} section 1.2 (scope)</ref> and so in general have a lower power consumption. Other low-power technologies such as [[ZigBee]] have fairly long range, but much lower data rate.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW. Note that this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost; this may not be the case in some situations, especially in large buildings or within a [[waveguide]]. In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Interference can be caused by overlapping channels. Any two channel numbers that differ by five or more, such as 2 and 7, do not overlap (no [[adjacent-channel interference]]). The oft-repeated adage that channels 1, 6, and 11 are the ''only'' non-overlapping channels is, therefore, not accurate. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing. Channels that are four apart interfere a negligible amount-much less than reusing channels (which causes [[co-channel interference]])-if transmitters are at least a few metres apart.<ref name=\"vilegas\">Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs - Eduard Garcia Villegas, Elena Lopez-Aguilera, Rafael Vidal, Josep Paradells (2007) {{DOI|10.1109/CROWNCOM.2007.4549783}}</ref> In Europe and Japan where channel 13 is available, using Channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 for [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] and [[IEEE 802.11#802.11n|802.11n]] is [[IEEE 802.11#Channels and international compatibility|recommended]].\n\nHowever, many 2.4 GHz 802.11b and 802.11g access-points default to the same channel on initial startup, contributing to congestion on certain channels.

Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements.

Unlike [[mobile phone]]s, any standard Wi-Fi device works anywhere in the world.\n\n=== Access point ===\n[[File:Apple-Airport-Extreme-80211g-WiFi-Card.jpg|thumb|An [[AirPort]] wireless G Wi-Fi adapter from an Apple [[MacBook]].]]\n\nA wireless access point (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired LAN. An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The [[Internet of Things]] and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2017-06-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630050952/http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|archive-date=2010-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |title       = Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n |accessdate  = 2008-04-29\n |url-status  = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428103306/http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |archivedate = 2008-04-28\n}}</ref> This allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons.|last=Jensen|first=Joe|date=2007-10-26|website=Networkbits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075900/http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|archivedate=2008-03-05|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

While effective against the casual user, it is ineffective as a security method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear in response to a client SSID query. Another method is to only allow computers with known [[MAC address]]es to join the network,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm#_Toc77524658\n |title       = Hacking Techniques in Wireless Networks\n |last        = Mateti\n |first       = Prabhaker\n |year        = 2005\n |publisher   = [[Wright State University]] Department of Computer Science and Engineering\n |location    = Dayton, Ohio\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100305180937/http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm#_Toc77524658\n |archivedate = 2010-03-05\n |url-status  = live\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-28\n}}</ref> but determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by [[MAC spoofing|spoofing]] an authorized address.\n\n[[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) encryption was designed to protect against casual snooping but it is no longer considered secure.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used. In 2018, [[WPA3]] was announced as a replacement for WPA2, increasing security;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|title=WPA3 protocol will make public Wi-Fi hotspots a lot more secure|last=Thubron|first=Rob|date=2018-01-09|website=Techspot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116023123/https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|archive-date=2018-11-16|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> it rolled out on June 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|title=Wi-Fi security is starting to get its biggest upgrade in over a decade|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2018-06-26|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220012909/https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|archive-date=2019-02-20|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Piggybacking ===\n{{Main|Piggybacking (Internet access)}}\n{{Further|Legality of piggybacking}}\n{{Further|Wi-Fi Protected Setup#Physical security issues}}\nPiggybacking refers to access to a wireless Internet connection by bringing one's own computer within the range of another's wireless connection, and using that service without the subscriber's explicit permission or knowledge.\n\nDuring the early popular adoption of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouraged{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to cultivate [[wireless community network]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nocat.net/ |title=NoCat's goal is to bring you Infinite Bandwidth Everywhere for Free |publisher=Nocat.net |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref> particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time.\n\nRecreational logging and mapping of other people's access points has become known as [[wardriving]]. Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks. Developing security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11#History}}\n\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Great Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

To communicate, devices must use a common Wi-Fi version. The versions differ between the radio wavebands they operate on, the radio bandwidth they occupy, the maximum data rates they can support and other details. Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet access ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314). In the US and other countries, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.\n\n802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax can use the [[U-NII|5&nbsp; GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp; MHz channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, where the channels are only 5 MHz wide. In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth. Additionally, they have gained the ability to [[Link aggregation|aggregate]] (or 'bond') channels together to gain still more throughput where the bandwidth is available. 802.11n allows for double radio spectrum/bandwidth (40 MHz- 8 channels) compared to [[IEEE 802.11a-1999|802.11a]] or 802.11g (20&nbsp;MHz). 802.11n can also be set to limit itself to 20 MHz bandwidth to prevent interference in dense communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|title=802.11n Data Rates Dependability and scalability|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Cisco]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705034144/http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/Aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|archive-date=2017-07-05|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> In the 5 GHz band, 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz bandwidth signals are permitted with some restrictions, giving much faster connections.\n\n=== Communication stack ===\n[[File:802.11_frame.png|alt=|right|frameless|622x622px|Generic 802.11 Frame]]\n{{Main|IEEE 802|IEEE 802.11}}\nWi-Fi is part of the IEEE 802 protocol family.

They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had many subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|title=What Does WiFi Stand For and How Does Wifi Work?|last=Stobing|first=Chris|date=2015-11-17|website=GadgetReview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201045951/http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|archivedate=December 1, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> As a result, in the market place, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nIn addition to 802.11 the IEEE 802 protocol family has specific provisions for Wi-Fi. These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]]. This means that nodes have an associated [[internet address]] and, with suitable connectivity, this allows full Internet access.\n\n===Modes===\n\n====Infrastructure====\n[[File:Wi-Fi.gif|thumb|Depiction of a Wi-Fi network in infrastructure mode. The device sends information wirelessly to another device, both connected to the local network, in order to print a document]]\nIn infrastructure mode, which is the most common mode used, all communications goes through a base station. For communications within the network, this introduces an extra use of the airwaves, but has the advantage that any two stations that can communicate with the base station can also communicate through the base station, which enormously simplifies the protocols.\n\n==== Ad hoc and Wi-Fi direct ====\nWi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary. This is called [[wireless ad hoc network|''ad hoc'' Wi-Fi transmission]]. Different types of ad hoc network exist. In the simplest case network nodes must talk directly to each other.

In addition, propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.\n\nAt longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.\n\n=== Transmitter power ===\nCompared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low power devices.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW.

In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band.

Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing.

On some 5 GHz bands interference from radar systems can occur in some places. For base stations that support those bands they employ Dynamic Frequency Selection which listens for radar, and if it is found, will not permit a network on that band.\n\nThese bands can be used by low power transmitters without a license, and with few restrictions. However, while unintended interference is common, users that have been found to cause deliberate interference (particularly for attempting to locally monopolize these bands for commercial purposes) have been issued large fines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/mobile-wireless/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|title=Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown|last=Brown|first=Bob|date=2016-03-10|website=[[Network World]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227033935/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|archive-date=2019-02-27|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Throughput ===\n[[File:Throughputenvelope80211g.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11g]]\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11n with 40 MHz]]\n\nVarious layer 2 variants of IEEE 802.11 have different characteristics. Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements. Each represents an average throughput of 25 measurements (the error bars are there, but barely visible due to the small variation), is with a specific packet size (small or large), and with a specific data rate (10 kbit/s \u2013 100 Mbit/s). Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. This text and measurements do not cover packet errors but information about this can be found at the above references.

Also, spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. However, building walls of certain materials, such as stone with high metal content, can block Wi-Fi signals.\n\nA Wi-Fi device is a [[short-range device|short-range]] [[wireless]] device. Wi-Fi devices are [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on [[RF CMOS]] [[integrated circuit]] ([[RF circuit]]) chips.<ref name=\"Happich\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Veendrick |first1=Harry J.

The price of [[chipset]]s for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in ever more devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|title=Free WiFi Analyzer-Best Channel Analyzer Apps For Wireless Networks|last=|first=|date=2017-06-08|website=The Digital Worm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808000116/https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|archivedate=2017-08-08|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDifferent competitive brands of access points and client network-interfaces can inter-operate at a basic level of service. Products designated as \"Wi-Fi Certified\" by the Wi-Fi Alliance are [[backward compatible]]. Unlike [[mobile phone]]s, any standard Wi-Fi device works anywhere in the world.\n\n=== Access point ===\n[[File:Apple-Airport-Extreme-80211g-WiFi-Card.jpg|thumb|An [[AirPort]] wireless G Wi-Fi adapter from an Apple [[MacBook]].]]\n\nA wireless access point (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired LAN. An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The [[Internet of Things]] and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2017-06-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630050952/http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|archive-date=2010-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |title       = Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n |accessdate  = 2008-04-29\n |url-status  = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428103306/http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |archivedate = 2008-04-28\n}}</ref> This allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons.|last=Jensen|first=Joe|date=2007-10-26|website=Networkbits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075900/http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|archivedate=2008-03-05|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used.

Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health concerns ==\n{{Further|Wireless electronic devices and health}}\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) says, \"no health effects are expected from exposure to RF fields from base stations and wireless networks\", but notes that they promote research into effects from other RF sources.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs304/en/\n |title       = Electromagnetic fields and public health -

One part is given to the [[Moroccan League for the Protection of Children]] in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] and the other part is distributed in schools along the route.\n\nThere is a strong relationship that has been developed between the raid and different association, for instance with the association \"Enfant du d\u00e9sert\" (children in the desert). This association has been created to encourage education for kids living in this particularly poor region of Morocco. Each year, children and students meet in the camping area and students gives the results of their materials rising to the association and play with the children. There is an official list of what students are supposed to bring. The main elements that are expected are school and sports materials but also medication. According to the raid organization, \u201cEnfant du d\u00e9sert\u201d got \u20ac33.665 from the participants and Deloitte and 20000 children will benefit this year from equipments that have been gathered by participants to the raid. \nAnother partnership with \u201cRire m\u00e9decin\u201d has been created in 2013 for the first time. Students were asked to give money and to support some actions for this association that aims to support children who are currently in hospital by providing them with games, activities and so on. Participants to the Raid have been asked to wear a clown red nose. This video has then been promoted by different media to advertise this association and raise funds.\n\n=== Sport aspect ===\nEvery day, the aim is to win the day's stage using the Road Book, a map of Morocco and a [[compass]]. The ranking is based on the teams' ability to drive in the desert and to reach the checkpoints as required. The aim is not to be the fastest team but to be able to reach the meeting point by doing as few kilometers as possible. And desert implies a lot of challenges. First of all, there is, of course, no road in the desert. The main obstacle for participants is called \"oued\" in Arab which means sand sea in English. These oued require a lot of ability to go through without trouble. Moreover, the car, a 4L Renault is not typically the best car to go through that kind of troubles.  Finally, visibility is often weak in the desert because of sand raised by other cars.\n\n=== A citizen Eco Raid ===\nRespecting the environment is a concern of 4L Trophy.\n\nThe partnership with CO<sub>2</sub> Solidarity aims at making up for [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions by funding a program for environmental protection in order to improve the living conditions of Moroccan people. \n  \nThe participation in the \"Clean Desert\" operation involves meticulous cleaning of bivouacs and rehabilitation of tracks. All Road Books are completely printed on recycled paper.\n\nThe partnership between the 4L Trophy organization and the financial advising firm Deloitte lead to the creation of the Deloitte-4l- Eco Challenge in 2008. This challenge consists in awarding the best action imagined by students participating to the 4L Trophy. For instance, in 2011, the Deloitte-4L-Eco challenge was awarded to a team from the Rouen Engineering school for installing a solar water pump in a village with no domestic water. Ten pre-selected teams receive \u20ac500 and the final winner receive \u20ac2500. The projects are chosen by the level of their social added value and ecological added.\n\n=== Media coverage===\nAs it has got more and more popular, 4L Trophy has started to attract more and more media and is now covered by national media as well as local ones, newspaper and video show.\n4L trophy is followed by national media as for instance the Figaro but also by specialist media as for example Turbo that dedicates an article to this event each year. \nThe most important media partners on the raid are:\n-France Bleu Radio which report the result and some events on a daily basis during the raid.\n-Turbo which is the most popular car TV show in France that send a team to film the raid and then broadcast it.\n-The raid also has its own press service that sends news and photos to journalists that are not following the raid. Also, for the first time last year,{{when|date=November 2013}} they created the 4L TV, an online TV channel, and upload news, videos and pictures every evening. Moreover, during the raid, they organized a  broadcast on Dailymotion direct from the desert, in Merzouga. \nThis media coverage as a big impact for the organization \u201c4L Trophy\u201d as well as for its participants since firms are more likely to sponsor a car if they hope to get some positive return for the stickers on it.\n\n=== Financing the project===\nFinancing the project is a hard part of the 4L Trophy for students. Almost every team rely on private funds to finance their project. The cost of participating to the raid can be evaluated between \u20ac5500 and \u20ac10000. The main spending factors are the inscription, which cost \u20ac3300, buying and preparing the car, that will cost between \u20ac1500 and \u20ac4000. \nThe main way to raise fund is by sponsoring. The idea behind that is that one (firm or individual) may \u201cbuy\u201d one part of the car and put its logo on this space. The firm can hope to get a positive return from that because 4L Trophy is quite popular in France and well covered by media. In exchange, the firm will give money or advantages. It is often the case between technicians and team. Technicians agree to prepare the car and get a space on the car in exchange.\nTeams also get money from the now famous \u201coperation stylo\u201d. The idea is to buy pen with 4L Trophy stickers for \u20ac0.25 each and then to sell it back on a marketplace or commercial center. This appear to be an efficient way to raise fund\n\n== Organisation ==\n\n=== Route ===\nTeams will leave from [[Paris]] and [[Bordeaux]] in the direction of [[Algeciras]] to sail to [[Morocco]].

These criteria are defined so that each car will be able to cross the desert with minimum troubles. The main modification is the protection plate each team has to add to its car in order to avoid troubles linked to stones you can find in the desert zone. \nThe organization will check each car before the departure. Checking operation focuses mostly on the structure of the car and the problem that it may cause. It may happen that a car is not accepted and does not meet the requirement. In this case, the team won\u2019t get the right to take the departure.\nA technical help is available in the camp each day after joining the camp.

He considered becoming a doctor but he enjoyed music so much he knew he would follow a career in music.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.glidemagazine.com/37642/steve-hunter/||title=Steve Hunter|publisher=Glide Magazine|date=June 15, 2013|last=Derrough|first=Leslie Michele|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion of his stint in the Army, he returned to Decatur where he built a reputation as an outstanding guitar player. \nOne day he got a telephone call from his Decatur friend, [[John Sauter|John \"Polar Bear\" Sauter]], that changed his life.\n\n==Career==\nHunter has had an illustrious 40-year career as a session musician, band member and as a solo performer.\n\n===Work with Mitch Ryder===\nJohn Sauter called Hunter to tell him that he was playing with [[Mitch Ryder]] in Detroit and that Ryder was auditioning for guitar players.  He suggested that Hunter come to Detroit and try out. Hunter packed up his guitar and made the eight-hour drive to Detroit.\nHunter made the cut and became part of Mitch Ryder's new band [[Detroit (band)|Detroit]]. There Hunter met and formed a long-time professional association with producer [[Bob Ezrin]].\nDetroit released one self-titled album on [[Paramount Records]]. They had a hit with a cover of Lou Reed's \"Rock & Roll\". Reed was so impressed with Hunter's arrangement and performance on that song that he recruited Hunter to join his band.<ref name=daily/>\n\n===Work with Alice Cooper===\nIn the 1970s, he appeared on five [[Alice Cooper]] albums, all of which were produced by Ezrin. His first recording with Cooper was in 1973 as a session musician on the second-to-last and most successful album recorded by the Alice Cooper Group, ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]''. When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' alongside guitarist [[Dick Wagner]] as seen in the film ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare (film)|Welcome to My Nightmare]]''. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show. In 2010, Hunter also worked on the basic tracks and solos for Cooper's album ''[[Welcome 2 My Nightmare]]'', touring with Cooper throughout 2011 on the [[No More Mr. Nice Guy Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/11/march/08Alice_Cooper_Announces_Tour_and_New_Band_Lineup.shtml |title=Alice Cooper Announces Tour and New Band Lineup ::Alice Cooper News |publisher=antiMusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}</ref>\nSteve notched up his ninth Alice Cooper release with \u2018Paranormal\u2019, released in 2017.\n\n===Work with Lou Reed===\nHis first collaboration with Lou Reed was for the ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' album.

In 2006, Reed and Hunter presented a new live version of ''Berlin'', released in 2008 as a DVD and CD ''[[Berlin: Live at St. Ann's Warehouse]]''.\n\n===Work with Aerosmith===\nIn 1974, he played the (uncredited) opening-half solo on [[Aerosmith]]'s \"[[Train Kept A-Rollin'#Aerosmith version|Train Kept a Rollin]]\" from ''Get Your Wings''.\nIn a February 2015 interview in ''Detroit Rock N Roll Magazine'' Hunter tells how it came about that he recorded that solo:\n\"Aerosmith was in Studio C of The Record Plant and I was doing work with Bob Ezrin in Studio A. I had a long wait between dubs and was waiting in the lobby. Jack Douglas popped his head out of Studio C and asked 'Hey, do you feel like playing?' I said sure, so I grabbed my guitar and went in. I had two run thru's, then Jack said 'great, that's it!' That turned out to be the opening solos on 'Train Kept A Rollin\u2019'.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.detroitrocknrollmagazine.com/2015/02/aerosmiths-train-kept-rollin-who-did.html|title=Who Really Played the Guitar Solos on Aerosmith's \"Train Kept A Rollin?\"|publisher=Detroit Rock N Roll Magazine|date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>\n\n===Work with Jack Bruce, Peter Gabriel and other artists===\nIn 1974, shortly after his work with the band on the live Reed albums, Hunter played guitar on former [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]]'s solo album ''[[Out of the Storm (Jack Bruce album)|Out of the Storm]]''.\n\nHe played on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s self-titled [[Peter Gabriel (1977 album)|first solo album (1977)]] that included the classic single \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\" which was likewise produced by Ezrin.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vintageguitar.com/3752/steve-hunter/|title=Steve Hunter - The deacon Sets It Straight|publisher=Vintage Guitar Magazine|date= |last=Allen|first=Rick|accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref> He also played on tour with Gabriel for the North American leg and a few shows in the UK during March / April 1977, sharing guitar duties with Robert Fripp. \n \nOther artists Hunter has worked with include [[David Lee Roth]] (in the mid-1990s), [[Julian Lennon]], [[Dr. John]], [[Tracy Chapman]] and more recently [[Glen Campbell]] and 2Cellos.

He considered becoming a doctor but he enjoyed music so much he knew he would follow a career in music.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.glidemagazine.com/37642/steve-hunter/||title=Steve Hunter|publisher=Glide Magazine|date=June 15, 2013|last=Derrough|first=Leslie Michele|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion of his stint in the Army, he returned to Decatur where he built a reputation as an outstanding guitar player. \nOne day he got a telephone call from his Decatur friend, [[John Sauter|John \"Polar Bear\" Sauter]], that changed his life.\n\n==Career==\nHunter has had an illustrious 40-year career as a session musician, band member and as a solo performer.\n\n===Work with Mitch Ryder===\nJohn Sauter called Hunter to tell him that he was playing with [[Mitch Ryder]] in Detroit and that Ryder was auditioning for guitar players.  He suggested that Hunter come to Detroit and try out. Hunter packed up his guitar and made the eight-hour drive to Detroit.\nHunter made the cut and became part of Mitch Ryder's new band [[Detroit (band)|Detroit]]. There Hunter met and formed a long-time professional association with producer [[Bob Ezrin]].\nDetroit released one self-titled album on [[Paramount Records]]. They had a hit with a cover of Lou Reed's \"Rock & Roll\". Reed was so impressed with Hunter's arrangement and performance on that song that he recruited Hunter to join his band.<ref name=daily/>\n\n===Work with Alice Cooper===\nIn the 1970s, he appeared on five [[Alice Cooper]] albums, all of which were produced by Ezrin. His first recording with Cooper was in 1973 as a session musician on the second-to-last and most successful album recorded by the Alice Cooper Group, ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]''. When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' alongside guitarist [[Dick Wagner]] as seen in the film ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare (film)|Welcome to My Nightmare]]''. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show. In 2010, Hunter also worked on the basic tracks and solos for Cooper's album ''[[Welcome 2 My Nightmare]]'', touring with Cooper throughout 2011 on the [[No More Mr. Nice Guy Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/11/march/08Alice_Cooper_Announces_Tour_and_New_Band_Lineup.shtml |title=Alice Cooper Announces Tour and New Band Lineup ::Alice Cooper News |publisher=antiMusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}</ref>\nSteve notched up his ninth Alice Cooper release with \u2018Paranormal\u2019, released in 2017.\n\n===Work with Lou Reed===\nHis first collaboration with Lou Reed was for the ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' album.

In 2006, Reed and Hunter presented a new live version of ''Berlin'', released in 2008 as a DVD and CD ''[[Berlin: Live at St. Ann's Warehouse]]''.\n\n===Work with Aerosmith===\nIn 1974, he played the (uncredited) opening-half solo on [[Aerosmith]]'s \"[[Train Kept A-Rollin'#Aerosmith version|Train Kept a Rollin]]\" from ''Get Your Wings''.\nIn a February 2015 interview in ''Detroit Rock N Roll Magazine'' Hunter tells how it came about that he recorded that solo:\n\"Aerosmith was in Studio C of The Record Plant and I was doing work with Bob Ezrin in Studio A. I had a long wait between dubs and was waiting in the lobby. Jack Douglas popped his head out of Studio C and asked 'Hey, do you feel like playing?' I said sure, so I grabbed my guitar and went in. I had two run thru's, then Jack said 'great, that's it!' That turned out to be the opening solos on 'Train Kept A Rollin\u2019'.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.detroitrocknrollmagazine.com/2015/02/aerosmiths-train-kept-rollin-who-did.html|title=Who Really Played the Guitar Solos on Aerosmith's \"Train Kept A Rollin?\"|publisher=Detroit Rock N Roll Magazine|date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>\n\n===Work with Jack Bruce, Peter Gabriel and other artists===\nIn 1974, shortly after his work with the band on the live Reed albums, Hunter played guitar on former [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]]'s solo album ''[[Out of the Storm (Jack Bruce album)|Out of the Storm]]''.\n\nHe played on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s self-titled [[Peter Gabriel (1977 album)|first solo album (1977)]] that included the classic single \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\" which was likewise produced by Ezrin.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vintageguitar.com/3752/steve-hunter/|title=Steve Hunter - The deacon Sets It Straight|publisher=Vintage Guitar Magazine|date= |last=Allen|first=Rick|accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref> He also played on tour with Gabriel for the North American leg and a few shows in the UK during March / April 1977, sharing guitar duties with Robert Fripp. \n \nOther artists Hunter has worked with include [[David Lee Roth]] (in the mid-1990s), [[Julian Lennon]], [[Dr. John]], [[Tracy Chapman]] and more recently [[Glen Campbell]] and 2Cellos.

Morton (1966)[https://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/0DABF9473B9C86D48525779800566A39/$File/Morton1966.pdf ''\"A Computer Oriented Geodetic Data Base and a New Technique in File Sequencing\"'']. Report in IBM Canada.\n</ref>, which encodes a geographic location into a short string of letters and digits. It is a hierarchical spatial data structure which subdivides space into buckets of [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] shape, which is one of the many applications of what is known as a [[Z-order curve]], and generally [[space-filling curves]].\n\nGeohashes offer properties like arbitrary precision and the possibility of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size (and gradually lose precision). As a consequence of the gradual precision degradation, nearby places will often (but not always) present similar prefixes. While in rare cases nearby places may have very short shared prefixes, the longer their shared prefix is, the closer two places are guaranteed to be.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe core part of the Geohash algorithm and the first initiative to similar solution was documented in a report of G.M. Morton in 1966, \"A Computer Oriented Geodetic Data Base and a New Technique in File Sequencing\"<ref name=\"morton66\"/>. The Morton work was used for efficient implementations of [[Z-order curve]], like in [https://github.com/yinqiwen/geohash-int this modern (2014) Geohash-integer version], based on direct interleave [[64-bit computing|64-bits integers]]. But his [[geocode]] proposal was not [[human-readable]] and was not popular. \n\nApparently, in the late 2000s, G. Niemeyer still didn't know about Morton's work, and reinvented it, adding the use of [[base32]] representation.  In February 2008, together with the announcement of the system,<ref name=\"first2008\"/> he launched the website <code>http://geohash.org</code>, which allows users to convert geographic coordinates to short [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s which uniquely identify positions on the [[Earth]], so that referencing them in [[email]]s, [[Internet forum|forums]], and [[website]]s is more convenient.\n\nMany variations has been developed, as the [[OpenStreetMap]]'s  ''short link''<ref name=\"osm_short_link\">\nThe [[OpenStreetMap]]'s ''short link'', [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shortlink documented in wiki.openstreetmap.org], was released   [https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/1d8e66016c4cdf465d06198cfbbfe76613ed3bfc/lib/short_link.rb in 2009], is near the same source-code  [https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/master/lib/short_link.rb 10 years after]. It is strongly based on [[Z-order curve|Morton's interlace algorithm]].\n</ref> (using [[base64]] instead of base32) in 2009,  the ''64-bit Geohash''<ref>\nThe \"Geohash binary 64 bits\" have  classic solutions, as [https://github.com/yinqiwen/geohash-int yinqiwen/geohash-int], and optimized solutions, as [https://mmcloughlin.com/posts/geohash-assembly mmcloughlin/geohash-assembly].\n</ref> in 2014, the exotic ''Hilbert-Geohash''<ref>Tibor Vukovic (2016), \"Hilbert-Geohash - Hashing Geographical Point Data Using the Hilbert Space-Filling Curve\"''. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d23c/996f44b1443fca76276ce8d37239fb8fd6f9.pdf</ref><ref>https://github.com/tammoippen/geohash-hilbert</ref> in 2016, and others.\n\n== Typical and main usages ==\nTo obtain the Geohash, the user provides an address to be [[geocode]]d, or [[latitude and longitude]] coordinates, in a single input box (most commonly used formats for latitude and longitude pairs are accepted), and performs the request.\n\nBesides showing the latitude and longitude corresponding to the given Geohash, users who navigate to a Geohash at geohash.org are also presented with an embedded map, and may download a [[GPX (data transfer)|GPX]] file, or transfer the waypoint directly to certain [[GPS]] receivers.  Links are also provided to external sites that may provide further details around the specified\nlocation.\n\nFor example, the coordinate pair <code>57.64911,10.40744</code> (near the tip of the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland, Denmark]]) produces a slightly shorter hash of <code>u4pruydqqvj</code>.\n\nThe main usages of Geohashes are:\n\n* As a unique identifier.\n* To represent point data, e.g. in databases.\n\nGeohashes have also been proposed to be used for [[geotagging]].\n\nWhen used in a database, the structure of geohashed data has two advantages. First, data indexed by geohash will have all points for a given rectangular area in contiguous slices (the number of slices depends on the precision required and the presence of geohash \"fault lines\"). This is especially useful in database systems where queries on a single index are much easier or faster than multiple-index queries. Second, this index structure can be used for a quick-and-dirty proximity search: the closest points are often among the closest geohashes.\n\n== Technical description ==\nA formal description for Computational and Mathematical views.\n\n=== Geometrical representation ===\nThe geometry of the Geohash have a mixed spatial representation:\n\n* Geohashes with 2, 4, 6, ... ''e'' digits ([[Parity (mathematics)|even]] digits) are represented by [[Z-order curve]] in a \"regular grid\" where decoded pair (latitude,longitude) has uniform uncertainty, valid as [[Geo URI scheme#Uncertainty|Geo URI]].\n\n* Geohashes with 1, 3, 5, ... ''d'' digits (odd digits) are represented by  \"\u0418-order curve\". Latitude and longitude of the decoded pair has different uncertainty (longitude is truncated).\n\n[[File:Geohash-OddEvenDigits.png.png|680px|center]]\n\n[[File:MortonCurve64grid-mergingCells.png|thumb|Merging cells of the \"next level\" to obtain a geometrical representation of the \"odd-digit Geohash\".]]\n\nIs possible to build the  \"\u0418-order curve\" from Z-order by merging neighboring cells and indexing the result rectangular grid by the function ''j''=[[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]](''i'' \u00f7 2). The side illustration shows how to obtain  the grid of 32 rectangular cells from the grid of 64 square cells.\n\n=== Algorithm and example ===\n\nUsing the hash <code>ezs42</code> as an example, here is how it is decoded into a decimal latitude and longitude.\n\nThe first step is decoding it from a variant of [[Base32|base 32]] using all digits 0-9 and almost all lower case letters except a, i, l and o like this:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Base 32\n| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 ||  b ||  c ||  d ||  e ||  f ||  g\n|-\n| style=\"font: 0.5em/0.5em serif;\" colspan=\"20\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n!

Base 32\n|  h ||  j ||  k ||  m ||  n ||  p ||  q ||  r ||  s ||  t ||  u ||  v ||  w ||  x ||  y ||  z\n|}\n\nThis operation results in the [[bit]]s 01101 11111 11000 00100 00010.  Assuming that counting starts at 0 in the left side, the even bits are taken for the longitude code (0111110000000), while the odd bits are taken for the latitude code (101111001001).\n\nEach binary code is then used in a series of divisions, considering one bit at a time, again from the left to the right side.  For the latitude value, the interval -90 to +90 is divided by 2, producing two intervals: -90 to 0, and 0 to +90.  Since the first bit is 1, the higher interval is chosen, and becomes the current interval. The procedure is repeated for all bits in the code.  Finally, the latitude value is the center of the resulting interval.  Longitudes are processed in an equivalent way, keeping in mind that the initial interval is -180 to +180.\n\nFor example, in the latitude code 101111001001, the first bit is 1, so we know our latitude is somewhere between 0 and 90. Without any more bits, we'd guess the latitude was 45, giving us an error of \u00b145. Since more bits are available, we can continue with the next bit, and each subsequent bit halves this error. This table shows the effect of each bit. At each stage, the relevant half of the range is highlighted in green; a low bit selects the lower range, a high bit selects the upper range.\n\nThe column \u201cmean value\u201d shows the latitude, simply the mean value of the range. Each subsequent bit makes this value more precise.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |Latitude code 101111001001\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! bit position\n!

However, [[edge case]] locations close to each other but on opposite sides of the 180 degree meridian will result in Geohash codes with no common prefix (different longitudes for near physical locations). Points close to the North and South poles will have very different geohashes (different longitudes for near physical locations).\n\nTwo close locations on either side of the Equator (or Greenwich meridian) will not have a long common prefix since they belong to different 'halves' of the world. Put simply, one location's binary latitude (or longitude) will be 011111... and the other 100000...., so they will not have a common prefix and most bits will be flipped. This can also be seen as a consequence of relying on the [[Z-order curve]] (which could more appropriately be called an N-order visit in this case) for ordering the points, as two points close-by might be visited at very different times. However, two points with a long common prefix will be close-by.\n\nIn order to do a proximity search, one could compute the southwest corner (low geohash with low latitude and longitude) and northeast corner (high geohash with high latitude and longitude) of a bounding box and search for geohashes between those two. This search will retrieve all points in the z-order curve between the two corners, which can be far too many points. This method also breaks down at the 180 meridians and the poles. Solr uses a filter list of prefixes, by computing the prefixes of the nearest squares close to the geohash [https://web.archive.org/web/20140513235817/http://lucenerevolution.org/sites/default/files/Lucene%20Rev%20Preso%20Smiley%20Spatial%20Search.pdf].\n\n=== Non-linearity ===\nSince a geohash (in this implementation) is based on [[Geographical coordinate system|coordinates of longitude and latitude]] the distance between two geohashes reflects the distance in latitude/longitude coordinates between two points, which does not translate to actual distance, see [[Haversine formula]].\n\nExample of non-linearity for latitude-longitude system:\n* At the Equator (0 Degrees) the length of a degree of longitude is 111.320&nbsp;km, while a degree of latitude measures 110.574&nbsp;km, an error of 0.67%.\n* At 30 Degrees (Mid Latitudes) the error is 110.852/96.486 = 14.89%\n* At 60 Degrees (High Arctic) the error is 111.412/55.800 = 99.67%, reaching infinity at the poles.\n\nNote that these limitations are not due to geohashing, and not due to latitude-longitude coordinates, but due to the difficulty of mapping coordinates on a sphere (non linear and with wrapping of values, similar to modulo arithmetic) to two dimensional coordinates and the difficulty of exploring a two dimensional space uniformly. The first is related to [[Geographical coordinate system]] and [[Map projection]], and the other to [[Hilbert curve]] and [[z-order curve]]. Once a coordinate system is found that represents points linearly in distance and wraps up at the edges, and can be explored uniformly, applying geohashing to those coordinates will not suffer from the limitations above.\n\nWhile it is possible to apply geohashing to an area with a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], it would then only apply to the area where the coordinate system applies.\n\nDespite those issues, there are possible workarounds, and the algorithm has been successfully used in Elasticsearch,<ref>[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-shape.html geo_shape Datatype in Elasticsearch]</ref> MongoDB,<ref>[http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing Geospatial Indexing in MongoDB]</ref> HBase, Redis, <ref>[https://redis.io/commands/geoadd]</ref> and [[Accumulo]]<ref>[https://geomesa.github.io/assets/outreach/SpatioTemporalIndexing_IEEEcopyright.pdf Spatio-temporal Indexing in Non-relational Distributed Databases]</ref> to implement proximity searches.\n\n== Similar indexing systems ==\nAn alternative to storing Geohashes as strings in a database are [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/pubs/SametVisualComputer89.pdf Locational codes], which are also called spatial keys and similar to QuadTiles.<ref>[http://karussell.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/spatial-keys-memory-efficient-geohashes/ Spatial Keys]</ref><ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/QuadTiles QuadTiles]</ref> \n\nIn some  [[geographical information systems]] and [[Big Data]] spatial databases, the [[Hilbert curve]] based indexation can be used as an alternative to [[Z-order curve]], like the <ref>\"S2 Geometry Library\" for optimized spatial indexation, https://s2geometry.io</ref>\n\n== Licensing ==\n\nThe Geohash algorithm was put in the [[public domain]] by its inventor in a public announcement on February 26, 2008.<ref>[http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=186412 geohash.org announcement post in groundspeak.com forum]</ref>\n\nWhile comparable algorithms have been successfully patented<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20050023524.html Compact text encoding of latitude/longitude coordinates - Patent 20050023524]</ref> and\nhad copyright claimed upon<ref>[http://www.gps-practice-and-fun.com/nacgeo.html#Microsoft Does Microsoft Infringe the Natural Area Coding System?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228091709/http://www.gps-practice-and-fun.com/nacgeo.html |date=2010-12-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nacgeo.com/nacsite/licensing/ The Natural Area Coding System - Legal and Licensing]</ref>, GeoHash is based on an entirely different algorithm and approach.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of geodesic-geocoding systems]]\n* [[Geohash-36]] (is not a Geohash-variant)\n* [[Grid (spatial index)]]\n* [[Maidenhead Locator System]]\n* [[Military Grid Reference System]]\n* [[Morton number (number theory)]]\n* [[Natural Area Code]]\n* [[Numbering scheme]]\n* [[Open Location Code]] (plus code)\n* [[space-filling curves]]\n* [[what3words]]\n* [[Z-order curve]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{official website|http://geohash.org/}}\n* [http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/geoloc.html elasticsearch: the definitive guide - Geo]\n* [https://github.com/adrianulbona/jts-discretizer Geohash approximations for JTS geometries]\n* [https://geohash.measurement.earth/ The Geohash Playground]\n{{geocoding-systems}}\n\n[[Category:Geographic coordinate systems]]\n[[Category:Geocodes]]\n[[Category:2008 introductions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A similarity-hashing function invented in 2008, specific for geographic coordinates compressing  or for location clustering}}\n{{about|the system for encoding geographic coordinates|the game|Geohashing}}\n\n'''Geohash''' is a [[public domain]] [[geocode#Geocode system|geocode system]]  invented in 2008 by Gustavo Niemeyer<ref name=\"first2008\">Evidences at the [[Wayback Machine]] (also with  [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305090620/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash 2008's records of this article]):\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305223755/http://blog.labix.org/#post-85 labix.org in 2008, the G.

Report in IBM Canada.\n</ref>, which encodes a geographic location into a short string of letters and digits. It is a hierarchical spatial data structure which subdivides space into buckets of [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] shape, which is one of the many applications of what is known as a [[Z-order curve]], and generally [[space-filling curves]].\n\nGeohashes offer properties like arbitrary precision and the possibility of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size (and gradually lose precision). As a consequence of the gradual precision degradation, nearby places will often (but not always) present similar prefixes. While in rare cases nearby places may have very short shared prefixes, the longer their shared prefix is, the closer two places are guaranteed to be.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe core part of the Geohash algorithm and the first initiative to similar solution was documented in a report of G.M. Morton in 1966, \"A Computer Oriented Geodetic Data Base and a New Technique in File Sequencing\"<ref name=\"morton66\"/>. The Morton work was used for efficient implementations of [[Z-order curve]], like in [https://github.com/yinqiwen/geohash-int this modern (2014) Geohash-integer version], based on direct interleave [[64-bit computing|64-bits integers]]. But his [[geocode]] proposal was not [[human-readable]] and was not popular. \n\nApparently, in the late 2000s, G. Niemeyer still didn't know about Morton's work, and reinvented it, adding the use of [[base32]] representation.  In February 2008, together with the announcement of the system,<ref name=\"first2008\"/> he launched the website <code>http://geohash.org</code>, which allows users to convert geographic coordinates to short [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s which uniquely identify positions on the [[Earth]], so that referencing them in [[email]]s, [[Internet forum|forums]], and [[website]]s is more convenient.\n\nMany variations has been developed, as the [[OpenStreetMap]]'s  ''short link''<ref name=\"osm_short_link\">\nThe [[OpenStreetMap]]'s ''short link'', [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shortlink documented in wiki.openstreetmap.org], was released   [https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/1d8e66016c4cdf465d06198cfbbfe76613ed3bfc/lib/short_link.rb in 2009], is near the same source-code  [https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/master/lib/short_link.rb 10 years after]. It is strongly based on [[Z-order curve|Morton's interlace algorithm]].\n</ref> (using [[base64]] instead of base32) in 2009,  the ''64-bit Geohash''<ref>\nThe \"Geohash binary 64 bits\" have  classic solutions, as [https://github.com/yinqiwen/geohash-int yinqiwen/geohash-int], and optimized solutions, as [https://mmcloughlin.com/posts/geohash-assembly mmcloughlin/geohash-assembly].\n</ref> in 2014, the exotic ''Hilbert-Geohash''<ref>Tibor Vukovic (2016), \"Hilbert-Geohash - Hashing Geographical Point Data Using the Hilbert Space-Filling Curve\"''. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d23c/996f44b1443fca76276ce8d37239fb8fd6f9.pdf</ref><ref>https://github.com/tammoippen/geohash-hilbert</ref> in 2016, and others.\n\n== Typical and main usages ==\nTo obtain the Geohash, the user provides an address to be [[geocode]]d, or [[latitude and longitude]] coordinates, in a single input box (most commonly used formats for latitude and longitude pairs are accepted), and performs the request.\n\nBesides showing the latitude and longitude corresponding to the given Geohash, users who navigate to a Geohash at geohash.org are also presented with an embedded map, and may download a [[GPX (data transfer)|GPX]] file, or transfer the waypoint directly to certain [[GPS]] receivers.  Links are also provided to external sites that may provide further details around the specified\nlocation.\n\nFor example, the coordinate pair <code>57.64911,10.40744</code> (near the tip of the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland, Denmark]]) produces a slightly shorter hash of <code>u4pruydqqvj</code>.\n\nThe main usages of Geohashes are:\n\n* As a unique identifier.\n* To represent point data, e.g. in databases.\n\nGeohashes have also been proposed to be used for [[geotagging]].\n\nWhen used in a database, the structure of geohashed data has two advantages. First, data indexed by geohash will have all points for a given rectangular area in contiguous slices (the number of slices depends on the precision required and the presence of geohash \"fault lines\"). This is especially useful in database systems where queries on a single index are much easier or faster than multiple-index queries. Second, this index structure can be used for a quick-and-dirty proximity search: the closest points are often among the closest geohashes.\n\n== Technical description ==\nA formal description for Computational and Mathematical views.\n\n=== Geometrical representation ===\nThe geometry of the Geohash have a mixed spatial representation:\n\n* Geohashes with 2, 4, 6, ... ''e'' digits ([[Parity (mathematics)|even]] digits) are represented by [[Z-order curve]] in a \"regular grid\" where decoded pair (latitude,longitude) has uniform uncertainty, valid as [[Geo URI scheme#Uncertainty|Geo URI]].\n\n* Geohashes with 1, 3, 5, ... ''d'' digits (odd digits) are represented by  \"\u0418-order curve\". Latitude and longitude of the decoded pair has different uncertainty (longitude is truncated).\n\n[[File:Geohash-OddEvenDigits.png.png|680px|center]]\n\n[[File:MortonCurve64grid-mergingCells.png|thumb|Merging cells of the \"next level\" to obtain a geometrical representation of the \"odd-digit Geohash\".]]\n\nIs possible to build the  \"\u0418-order curve\" from Z-order by merging neighboring cells and indexing the result rectangular grid by the function ''j''=[[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]](''i'' \u00f7 2). The side illustration shows how to obtain  the grid of 32 rectangular cells from the grid of 64 quadrilateral cells.\n\n=== Algorithm and example ===\n\nUsing the hash <code>ezs42</code> as an example, here is how it is decoded into a decimal latitude and longitude.\n\nThe first step is decoding it from a variant of [[Base32|base 32]] using all digits 0-9 and almost all lower case letters except a, i, l and o like this:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Decimal\n| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15\n|-\n! Base 32\n| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 ||  b ||  c ||  d ||  e ||  f ||  g\n|-\n| style=\"font: 0.5em/0.5em serif;\" colspan=\"20\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n! Decimal\n| 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30 || 31\n|-\n! Base 32\n|  h ||  j ||  k ||  m ||  n ||  p ||  q ||  r ||  s ||  t ||  u ||  v ||  w ||  x ||  y ||  z\n|}\n\nThis operation results in the [[bit]]s 01101 11111 11000 00100 00010.  Assuming that counting starts at 0 in the left side, the even bits are taken for the longitude code (0111110000000), while the odd bits are taken for the latitude code (101111001001).\n\nEach binary code is then used in a series of divisions, considering one bit at a time, again from the left to the right side.  For the latitude value, the interval -90 to +90 is divided by 2, producing two intervals: -90 to 0, and 0 to +90.  Since the first bit is 1, the higher interval is chosen, and becomes the current interval. The procedure is repeated for all bits in the code.  Finally, the latitude value is the center of the resulting interval.  Longitudes are processed in an equivalent way, keeping in mind that the initial interval is -180 to +180.\n\nFor example, in the latitude code 101111001001, the first bit is 1, so we know our latitude is somewhere between 0 and 90. Without any more bits, we'd guess the latitude was 45, giving us an error of \u00b145. Since more bits are available, we can continue with the next bit, and each subsequent bit halves this error. This table shows the effect of each bit.

However, [[edge case]] locations close to each other but on opposite sides of the 180 degree meridian will result in Geohash codes with no common prefix (different longitudes for near physical locations). Points close to the North and South poles will have very different geohashes (different longitudes for near physical locations).\n\nTwo close locations on either side of the Equator (or Greenwich meridian) will not have a long common prefix since they belong to different 'halves' of the world. Put simply, one location's binary latitude (or longitude) will be 011111... and the other 100000...., so they will not have a common prefix and most bits will be flipped. This can also be seen as a consequence of relying on the [[Z-order curve]] (which could more appropriately be called an N-order visit in this case) for ordering the points, as two points close-by might be visited at very different times. However, two points with a long common prefix will be close-by.\n\nIn order to do a proximity search, one could compute the southwest corner (low geohash with low latitude and longitude) and northeast corner (high geohash with high latitude and longitude) of a bounding box and search for geohashes between those two. This search will retrieve all points in the z-order curve between the two corners, which can be far too many points. This method also breaks down at the 180 meridians and the poles. Solr uses a filter list of prefixes, by computing the prefixes of the nearest squares close to the geohash [https://web.archive.org/web/20140513235817/http://lucenerevolution.org/sites/default/files/Lucene%20Rev%20Preso%20Smiley%20Spatial%20Search.pdf].\n\n=== Non-linearity ===\nSince a geohash (in this implementation) is based on [[Geographical coordinate system|coordinates of longitude and latitude]] the distance between two geohashes reflects the distance in latitude/longitude coordinates between two points, which does not translate to actual distance, see [[Haversine formula]].\n\nExample of non-linearity for latitude-longitude system:\n* At the Equator (0 Degrees) the length of a degree of longitude is 111.320&nbsp;km, while a degree of latitude measures 110.574&nbsp;km, an error of 0.67%.\n* At 30 Degrees (Mid Latitudes) the error is 110.852/96.486 = 14.89%\n* At 60 Degrees (High Arctic) the error is 111.412/55.800 = 99.67%, reaching infinity at the poles.\n\nNote that these limitations are not due to geohashing, and not due to latitude-longitude coordinates, but due to the difficulty of mapping coordinates on a sphere (non linear and with wrapping of values, similar to modulo arithmetic) to two dimensional coordinates and the difficulty of exploring a two dimensional space uniformly. The first is related to [[Geographical coordinate system]] and [[Map projection]], and the other to [[Hilbert curve]] and [[z-order curve]]. Once a coordinate system is found that represents points linearly in distance and wraps up at the edges, and can be explored uniformly, applying geohashing to those coordinates will not suffer from the limitations above.\n\nWhile it is possible to apply geohashing to an area with a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], it would then only apply to the area where the coordinate system applies.\n\nDespite those issues, there are possible workarounds, and the algorithm has been successfully used in Elasticsearch,<ref>[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-shape.html geo_shape Datatype in Elasticsearch]</ref> MongoDB,<ref>[http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing Geospatial Indexing in MongoDB]</ref> HBase, Redis, <ref>[https://redis.io/commands/geoadd]</ref> and [[Accumulo]]<ref>[https://geomesa.github.io/assets/outreach/SpatioTemporalIndexing_IEEEcopyright.pdf Spatio-temporal Indexing in Non-relational Distributed Databases]</ref> to implement proximity searches.\n\n== Similar indexing systems ==\nAn alternative to storing Geohashes as strings in a database are [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/pubs/SametVisualComputer89.pdf Locational codes], which are also called spatial keys and similar to QuadTiles.<ref>[http://karussell.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/spatial-keys-memory-efficient-geohashes/ Spatial Keys]</ref><ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/QuadTiles QuadTiles]</ref> \n\nIn some  [[geographical information systems]] and [[Big Data]] spatial databases, the [[Hilbert curve]] based indexation can be used as an alternative to [[Z-order curve]], like the <ref>\"S2 Geometry Library\" for optimized spatial indexation, https://s2geometry.io</ref>\n\n== Licensing ==\n\nThe Geohash algorithm was put in the [[public domain]] by its inventor in a public announcement on February 26, 2008.<ref>[http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=186412 geohash.org announcement post in groundspeak.com forum]</ref>\n\nWhile comparable algorithms have been successfully patented<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20050023524.html Compact text encoding of latitude/longitude coordinates - Patent 20050023524]</ref> and\nhad copyright claimed upon<ref>[http://www.gps-practice-and-fun.com/nacgeo.html#Microsoft Does Microsoft Infringe the Natural Area Coding System?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228091709/http://www.gps-practice-and-fun.com/nacgeo.html |date=2010-12-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nacgeo.com/nacsite/licensing/ The Natural Area Coding System - Legal and Licensing]</ref>, GeoHash is based on an entirely different algorithm and approach.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of geodesic-geocoding systems]]\n* [[Geohash-36]] (is not a Geohash-variant)\n* [[Grid (spatial index)]]\n* [[Maidenhead Locator System]]\n* [[Military Grid Reference System]]\n* [[Morton number (number theory)]]\n* [[Natural Area Code]]\n* [[Numbering scheme]]\n* [[Open Location Code]] (plus code)\n* [[space-filling curves]]\n* [[what3words]]\n* [[Z-order curve]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{official website|http://geohash.org/}}\n* [http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/geoloc.html elasticsearch: the definitive guide - Geo]\n* [https://github.com/adrianulbona/jts-discretizer Geohash approximations for JTS geometries]\n* [https://geohash.measurement.earth/ The Geohash Playground]\n{{geocoding-systems}}\n\n[[Category:Geographic coordinate systems]]\n[[Category:Geocodes]]\n[[Category:2008 introductions]]\n", "name_user": "Krauss", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTechnical description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash"}

Joe's 200''' was a [[Champ Car|Championship Auto Racing Teams]] (CART) motor race held on June 24, 2001, at [[Portland International Raceway]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], USA. It was the 8th round of the [[2001 CART season]]. The race was won from the [[pole position|pole]] in severe wet conditions by [[Max Papis]] for [[Team Rahal]].  [[Roberto Moreno]] finished second, and [[Christian Fittipaldi]] clinched third.\n\nIt was Papis' second career CART win and his first of the 2001 season. It was also his second career pole in the series, as well as his last. For Moreno, it was his second consecutive runner-up at Portland and his second consecutive podium that season after finishing third at [[2001 Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit|Detroit]]. It would also be Fittipaldi's only podium finish that season.\n\nThe race was marred by heavy rain the night before the race, which created a wet track with multiple areas of standing water. This proved to be a challenge to many drivers, with the majority of them spinning at least once during the race, resulting in multiple caution periods in the first half of the race. Originally scheduled for 98 laps, the race reached the two-hour time limit after 76 laps.\n\n==Report==\n===Background===\nComing into Portland after a dominant race in [[2001 Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit|Detroit]], Team Penske was the favorite to control Round 8 of the 2001 season. In particular, [[Gil de Ferran]], defending series champion and two-time defending Portland winner, was tipped to be a strong contender and perhaps even take his first win of the season.<ref name =\"preview\">{{cite web|title=CART Portland Preview|publisher=Championship Auto Racing Teams|date=June 19, 2001|url=http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=936|accessdate=July 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010816000111/http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=936|archivedate=August 16, 2001}}</ref> His teammate [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] on the other hand, having climbed the fence in Detroit after his latest victory, was also considered to be in the hunt for the win.<ref name =\"preview\"/>\n\nGoing into the race, Castroneves had closed the gap to points leader [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] in the standings, and the margin between first and second was only five points. Meanwhile, [[Michael Andretti]] had put together a streak of top-six finishes in the last four races to put himself in third in the standings.<ref name =\"preview\"/> Defending champion de Ferran was sitting in a cool fifth place in the standings. Meanwhile, \"Super Sub\" [[Memo Gidley]] was called up to replace [[Nicolas Minassian]] in the [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Chip Ganassi]] #12 car for the rest of the season after Minassian was released by the team.<ref>{{cite web|title=GIDLEY TO REPLACE MINASSIAN AT PORTLAND|publisher=Championship Auto Racing Teams|date=June 20, 2001|url=http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=937|accessdate=July 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010627134634/http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=937|archivedate=June 27, 2001 }}</ref> Gidley had previously raced for both [[Forsythe Racing]] and [[Della Penna Motorsports]] during the [[2000 CART season]].\n\n===Practice and Qualifying===\nPractice 1 saw Kenny Br\u00e4ck top the time sheets with a 58.606.

Defending race winner de Ferran could only muster 15th place, less than a second behind the leader.\n\nOn the other hand, qualifying proved to be a disaster for points leader Kenny Br\u00e4ck, as an exhaust system failure ignited his car and brought out the red flag to stop the session.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portland Saturday Notebook|author=Robin Miller|publisher=Championship Auto Racing Teams|date=June 23, 2001|url=http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=984|accessdate=July 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020328123043/http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=984|archivedate=March 28, 2002}}</ref> As a result, he was given an eight-minute penalty by CART officials and could only run four laps in the backup car. When qualifying ended, Br\u00e4ck only qualified 22nd out of 26 while his teammate took the pole.\n\n===Race===\nOn raceday, rain had soaked the track for the first time since the CART teams arrived in Portland, meaning that drivers and teams alike could not rely on their practice and qualifying setups during the race itself. To make matters more difficult, the rain had continued as a light drizzle all throughout the morning warm-up and heading into the race, and CART officials decided that it was light enough to continue with the event. Portland International Raceway was already notorious for its first-turn chicane and difficulty to overtake; now drivers had to contend with a wet racetrack that nobody had practiced on all weekend.\n\nOn the pace lap, de Ferran became the first of what would ultimately be many drivers to spin off-course during the race. Going through Turn 7, de Ferran lost traction and slid into the grass, damaging his front wing and forcing him to make a pit stop.\n\nWhen the green flag waved, the field was engulfed in a cloud of spray as the cars accelerated to race speed. Going into the first turn, the cars of Michael Andretti and Kenny Br\u00e4ck were spun around, but they continued with no damage. Meanwhile, as the field sped down the back straightaway, [[Tony Kanaan]] went off-course at Turn 8. As he rejoined the track, he veered into the path of Memo Gidley, clipping his right rear tire and spinning him into the path of [[Alex Zanardi]], who passing was Kanaan on the left. Zanardi and Gidley careened into the barriers, but both drivers walked away unharmed. Kanaan, meanwhile, had suffered major suspension damage, but he was able to limp back to the pits and officially retire the car.\n\nUnder the caution flag, going into Turn 7, Helio Castroneves slid off the track and nudged into the tire barriers. He was eventually restarted, but the incident put him a lap down. When the race restarted on Lap 6, the field circulated through Turn 1 cleanly with the exception of [[Tora Takagi]] and [[Shinji Nakano]], who both spun and stalled their cars on the track. The yellow flag waved once again as both cars were restarted. After a brief caution period, the field went back to green on Lap 8. Cristiano da Matta and [[Max Wilson]] both ran wide going into the first corner, forcing them to cut the chicane. Michael Andretti also spun in Turn 1, but kept the car running. Finally, the race was stopped again when [[Adrian Fern\u00e1ndez]] spun out later on-course and stalled the car.\n\nUnder the third caution, da Matta had too much speed going into Turn 8 and bumped the back of Papis' car, spinning himself around and stalling the car. After three caution laps, the race was again restarted on Lap 13, only to be stopped again when [[Bryan Herta]] was spun out by Wilson and stalled the car. At the same time, [[Alex Tagliani]] ran off course and punctured his right rear tire but kept the car running. After a single caution lap, the field continued under the green flag. The 15th lap of the race was the first to be incident-free, and after four cautions twelve of the twenty-six starters had spun off-track. By this time, [[Paul Tracy]] had muscled his way from 13th to 2nd and was catching up to Papis in the lead. However, after only four laps, the caution came again when Takagi spun and stalled his car a second time.\n\nUnder this fifth caution, Tracy used the opportunity to psychologically intimidate Papis by pulling alongside and tailgating him for several laps. However, Papis was able to pull away when the green flag came out again on Lap 24, but the field again only made it through a few corners before [[Michel Jourdain, Jr.]] spun off course coming out of Turn 1, forcing a sixth caution. When the green came out again after one lap, Andretti was given a drive-through penalty for passing under yellow. Again Papis pulled away from the field and mounted a sizeable gap between him and Tracy in 2nd.\n\nAfter several laps of green-flag running, the caution flag waved again on Lap 33 when [[Adrian Fern\u00e1ndez]] spun off-course. The field used this opportunity to make their one and only pit stop during the race, and Papis again capitalized by leaving the pits first. At the same time, however, Paul Tracy slammed into the side of [[Bruno Junqueira]] as he left his pit box, ending Junqueira's race and damaging Tracy's suspension. [[Roberto Moreno]] took advantage of the situation and jumped both Tracy and Franchitti in the pits. [[Christian Fittipaldi]] inherited the lead by virtue of not pitting under the caution, followed by da Matta, who was now on the same strategy, and Papis in third.\n\nWhen the race restarted on Lap 36, Franchitti ran into the back of Bryan Herta and spun going into Turn 1, forcing Herta and Moreno to cut the chicane. However, as Franchitti continued the race remained under green. On the same lap, Br\u00e4ck and de Ferran spun in separate corners, but both were able to continue. Just a few laps later, on Lap 40, Shinji Nakano spun once again, but this time he suffered suspension damage that ended his race and brought out another caution. Fittipaldi and da Matta used this time to pit, handing the lead back to Papis.\n\nThe green flag waved again on Lap 44, but once again both Tagliani and Jourdain, Jr. spun at the same corner. As the race stayed green, Paul Tracy spun coming onto the back straightaway and clipped Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin, ending both of their races and bringing out the caution for what would be the 9th and final time. After three laps of caution, the green waved again and Papis took off from the rest of the field. Moreno and Wilson diced for 2nd position over the course of several laps as the rain briefly stopped before picking up again. Meanwhile, Fittipaldi began to climb up the order after restarting in 7th place. As the stretch of green-flag racing continued, the drivers who pitted on Lap 33 were told to conserve fuel to make it to the end of the race. This played into Fittipaldi's hands, as he had pitted on Lap 40 and had more than enough fuel to last the race distance.\n\nAs the race continued, race control officially declared a timed race on Lap 68, meaning that the race would only go 76 of the designated 98 laps before two hours had elapsed. By this point Fittipaldi had passed [[Patrick Carpentier]] for 4th, and was beginning to go after Wilson for a spot on the podium. With just eight minutes to go in the race, Fittipaldi cruised past Wilson going into Turn 1 and began closing on the leaders. However, after 76 laps and two hours since the drop of the green flag, Papis and Moreno were able to hold him off and take the checkered flag.\n\n==Qualifying==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=6|June 23, 2001 - Qualifying Speeds\n|- \n!

Joe's 200''' was a [[Champ Car|Championship Auto Racing Teams]] (CART) motor race held on June 24, 2001, at [[Portland International Raceway]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], USA. It was the 8th round of the [[2001 CART season]]. The race was won from the [[pole position|pole]] in severe wet conditions by [[Max Papis]] for [[Team Rahal]].  [[Roberto Moreno]] finished second, and [[Christian Fittipaldi]] clinched third.\n\nIt was Papis' second career CART win and his first of the 2001 season. It was also his second career pole in the series, as well as his last. For Moreno, it was his second consecutive runner-up at Portland and his second consecutive podium that season after finishing third at [[2001 Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit|Detroit]]. It would also be Fittipaldi's only podium finish that season.\n\nThe race was marred by heavy rain the night before the race, which created a wet track with multiple areas of standing water. This proved to be a challenge to many drivers, with the majority of them spinning at least once during the race, resulting in multiple caution periods in the first half of the race. Originally scheduled for 98 laps, the race reached the two-hour time limit after 76 laps.\n\n==Report==\n===Background===\nComing into Portland after a dominant race in [[2001 Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit|Detroit]], Team Penske was the favorite to control Round 8 of the 2001 season. In particular, [[Gil de Ferran]], defending series champion and two-time defending Portland winner, was tipped to be a strong contender and perhaps even take his first win of the season.<ref name =\"preview\">{{cite web|title=CART Portland Preview|publisher=Championship Auto Racing Teams|date=June 19, 2001|url=http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=936|accessdate=July 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010816000111/http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=936|archivedate=August 16, 2001}}</ref> His teammate [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] on the other hand, having climbed the fence in Detroit after his latest victory, was also considered to be in the hunt for the win.<ref name =\"preview\"/>\n\nGoing into the race, Castroneves had closed the gap to points leader [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] in the standings, and the margin between first and second was only five points.

Defending race winner de Ferran could only muster 15th place, less than a second behind the leader.\n\nOn the other hand, qualifying proved to be a disaster for points leader Kenny Br\u00e4ck, as an exhaust system failure ignited his car and brought out the red flag to stop the session.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portland Saturday Notebook|author=Robin Miller|publisher=Championship Auto Racing Teams|date=June 23, 2001|url=http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=984|accessdate=July 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020328123043/http://www.cart.com/News.asp?ID=984|archivedate=March 28, 2002}}</ref> As a result, he was given an eight-minute penalty by CART officials and could only run four laps in the backup car. When qualifying ended, Br\u00e4ck only qualified 22nd out of 26 while his teammate took the pole.\n\n===Race===\nOn raceday, rain had soaked the track for the first time since the CART teams arrived in Portland, meaning that drivers and teams alike could not rely on their practice and qualifying setups during the race itself. To make matters more difficult, the rain had continued as a light drizzle all throughout the morning warm-up and heading into the race, and CART officials decided that it was light enough to continue with the event. Portland International Raceway was already notorious for its first-turn chicane and difficulty to overtake; now drivers had to contend with a wet racetrack that nobody had practiced on all weekend.\n\nOn the pace lap, de Ferran became the first of what would ultimately be many drivers to spin off-course during the race. Going through Turn 7, de Ferran lost traction and slid into the grass, damaging his front wing and forcing him to make a pit stop.\n\nWhen the green flag waved, the field was engulfed in a cloud of spray as the cars accelerated to race speed. Going into the first turn, the cars of Michael Andretti and Kenny Br\u00e4ck were spun around, but they continued with no damage. Meanwhile, as the field sped down the back straightaway, [[Tony Kanaan]] went off-course at Turn 8. As he rejoined the track, he veered into the path of Memo Gidley, clipping his right rear tire and spinning him into the path of [[Alex Zanardi]], who passing was Kanaan on the left. Zanardi and Gidley careened into the barriers, but both drivers walked away unharmed. Kanaan, meanwhile, had suffered major suspension damage, but he was able to limp back to the pits and officially retire the car.\n\nUnder the caution flag, going into Turn 7, Helio Castroneves slid off the track and nudged into the tire barriers. He was eventually restarted, but the incident put him a lap down. When the race restarted on Lap 6, the field circulated through Turn 1 cleanly with the exception of [[Tora Takagi]] and [[Shinji Nakano]], who both spun and stalled their cars on the track. The yellow flag waved once again as both cars were restarted. After a brief caution period, the field went back to green on Lap 8. Cristiano da Matta and [[Max Wilson]] both ran wide going into the first corner, forcing them to cut the chicane. Michael Andretti also spun in Turn 1, but kept the car running. Finally, the race was stopped again when [[Adrian Fern\u00e1ndez]] spun out later on-course and stalled the car.\n\nUnder the third caution, da Matta had too much speed going into Turn 8 and bumped the back of Papis' car, spinning himself around and stalling the car. After three caution laps, the race was again restarted on Lap 13, only to be stopped again when [[Bryan Herta]] was spun out by Wilson and stalled the car. At the same time, [[Alex Tagliani]] ran off course and punctured his right rear tire but kept the car running. After a single caution lap, the field continued under the green flag. The 15th lap of the race was the first to be incident-free, and after four cautions twelve of the twenty-six starters had spun off-track. By this time, [[Paul Tracy]] had muscled his way from 13th to 2nd and was catching up to Papis in the lead. However, after only four laps, the caution came again when Takagi spun and stalled his car a second time.\n\nUnder this fifth caution, Tracy used the opportunity to psychologically intimidate Papis by pulling alongside and tailgating him for several laps. However, Papis was able to pull away when the green flag came out again on Lap 24, but the field again only made it through a few corners before [[Michel Jourdain, Jr.]] spun off course coming out of Turn 1, forcing a sixth caution. When the green came out again after one lap, Andretti was given a drive-though penalty for passing under yellow. Again Papis pulled away from the field and mounted a sizeable gap between him and Tracy in 2nd.\n\nAfter several laps of green-flag running, the caution flag waved again on Lap 33 when [[Adrian Fern\u00e1ndez]] spun off-course. The field used this opportunity to make their one and only pit stop during the race, and Papis again capitalized by leaving the pits first. At the same time, however, Paul Tracy slammed into the side of [[Bruno Junqueira]] as he left his pit box, ending Junqueira's race and damaging Tracy's suspension. [[Roberto Moreno]] took advantage of the situation and jumped both Tracy and Franchitti in the pits. [[Christian Fittipaldi]] inherited the lead by virtue of not pitting under the caution, followed by da Matta, who was now on the same strategy, and Papis in third.\n\nWhen the race restarted on Lap 36, Franchitti ran into the back of Bryan Herta and spun going into Turn 1, forcing Herta and Moreno to cut the chicane. However, as Franchitti continued the race remained under green. On the same lap, Br\u00e4ck and de Ferran spun in separate corners, but both were able to continue. Just a few laps later, on Lap 40, Shinji Nakano spun once again, but this time he suffered suspension damage that ended his race and brought out another caution. Fittipaldi and da Matta used this time to pit, handing the lead back to Papis.\n\nThe green flag waved again on Lap 44, but once again both Tagliani and Jourdain, Jr. spun at the same corner. As the race stayed green, Paul Tracy spun coming onto the back straightaway and clipped Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin, ending both of their races and bringing out the caution for what would be the 9th and final time. After three laps of caution, the green waved again and Papis took off from the rest of the field. Moreno and Wilson diced for 2nd position over the course of several laps as the rain briefly stopped before picking up again. Meanwhile, Fittipaldi began to climb up the order after restarting in 7th place. As the stretch of green-flag racing continued, the drivers who pitted on Lap 33 were told to conserve fuel to make it to the end of the race. This played into Fittipaldi's hands, as he had pitted on Lap 40 and had more than enough fuel to last the race distance.\n\nAs the race continued, race control officially declared a timed race on Lap 68, meaning that the race would only go 76 of the designated 98 laps before two hours had elapsed. By this point Fittipaldi had passed [[Patrick Carpentier]] for 4th, and was beginning to go after Wilson for a spot on the podium. With just eight minutes to go in the race, Fittipaldi cruised past Wilson going into Turn 1 and began closing on the leaders. However, after 76 laps and two hours since the drop of the green flag, Papis and Moreno were able to hold him off and take the checkered flag.\n\n==Qualifying==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=6|June 23, 2001 - Qualifying Speeds\n|- \n!
