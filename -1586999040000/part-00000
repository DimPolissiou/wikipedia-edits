When the rest of the firehouse realizes that he had actually turned McLeod down, they befriend him and helped him through his marital problems.

When Hayes is found dead, Clarke becomes the prime suspect and tries to protect Lisa upon finding out that she had been involved.

He had a love-hate relationship with his son as he had left Kelly and his mother when the latter was ten years old and had Katie, Kelly's half-sister, with another woman. He lived in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] with his new wife Beth and two sons but abandoned them and moved to Chicago without Kelly's knowledge.

He did one last favor before his death.\n* [[Jeff Hephner]] as Lieutenant Jeff Clarke: After his firehouse is closed, he is transferred to Firehouse 51, Squad 3. Initially, he was not liked by the rest of the crew as he was extremely private and preferred to read newspapers at the squad's table rather than socialize with them in the lounge. His arrival at 51 coincided with McLeod's efforts to find reasons to close Firehouse 51 down and he was falsely accused of being McLeod's mole. When the rest of the firehouse realizes that he had actually turned McLeod down, they befriend him and helped him through his marital problems. He was also revealed to be a former Marine and [[Iraq War|Iraq]] veteran. His wife Lisa had cheated on him while he was on his final tour and were estranged when the character is first introduced. They reconnect after she asks for his forgiveness and he and the crew were nearly killed by a burning propane tanker on a call. Lisa's ex-lover Hayes turned out to be a loan shark who continuously harasses them to the point where Clarke was prepared to kill the man with his military-issue sniper rifle. When Hayes is found dead, Clarke becomes the prime suspect and tries to protect Lisa upon finding out that she had been involved. He transferred out of 51 after being promoted to lieutenant and is now the commander of Truck 25.

His experience and charismatic personality quickly wins over Severide and the rest of the men, although Herrmann initially antagonized him as he had yet to come to terms with the recent suicide of Candidate Rebecca Jones. When off duty, he moonlights as a [[skiptrace]]r and has been seen entertaining his coworkers with stories of his \"clientele\". Mills looks up to him as an older brother figure. He hails from the crime-ridden Chicago area of [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] and, despite getting out, still goes back to visit family. He is a single father with an elementary school-age daughter Naomi. In season 3, he leaves Chicago to visit family in Miami and Scott Rice takes over his spot on Squad 3 on a temporary basis. Whether or not Newhouse will return remains ambiguous.\n* [[Michelle Forbes]] as Gail McLeod: a financial consultant hired by the state to help trim the budget of the CFD which includes closing some firehouses. She had Lieutenant Spellman, a transfer from a closed firehouse, \"report\" to her on the activities of the crew at 51 but Spellman was coerced into transferring out when the entire crew, led by Lieutenants Casey and Severide, staged a plan to run him out upon discovering that he was the mole. Mouch rallies the union to fight back when he discovers the reason why McLeod was so keen on closing down firehouses. The community and fellow firefighters rally behind 51, drawing the attention of State Senator Wheeler, who orders his assistant Isabella, then-girlfriend of Peter Mills, to reverse the closure of 51.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2013-08-28/entertainment/41547660_1_chicago-fire-powerful-chicago-mayor-tom-kane|title=Jeff Hephner fired up for Chicago, again|last=Wagner|first=Curt|work=RedEye|date=August 28, 2013|accessdate=October 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124062434/http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2013-08-28/entertainment/41547660_1_chicago-fire-powerful-chicago-mayor-tom-kane|archive-date=January 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* John Hoogenakker as Lieutenant Spellman: He is assigned to Firehouse 51, along with Clarke, after city budget cuts force downsizing in the department.

At first Rafferty seems distant toward Shay and when Shay later confronts her, she tells her that her previous partner at 24 was a lesbian and used to make phone calls to her girlfriend that made Rafferty uncomfortable.

Miller with the purchasing of plots (80 acres) in Wesley Heights. W.C. and A.N. Miller  began constructing homes in Wesley Heights, and also in the neighboring communities of [[Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.|Spring Valley]] and [[American University Park]].  W.C. and A.N. Miller planned development in Wesley Heights was one of the first master-[[planned communities]] in the [[United States]] and featured such services as a [[Public transport|shuttle]] to the [[Wisconsin Avenue]] [[Washington streetcars|streetcar]] and a community club house.\n\n==Wesley Heights' Geography before the 1920 revitalization==\nNot much is known about the geography of Wesley Heights before W.C. and A.N. Miller began building houses on Wesley Heights. Nevertheless, in 1894 [[Kate Field]], the renown American journalist, notes in her published periodical journal (Kate Field's Washington), a vivid description of Wesley Heights from a viewpoint on Charles Glover's estate. According to Kate Field: \n\n''\"Whoever stands on the broad piazza of Mr. and Mrs. C.C Glover's country home, \"Westover\", on Wesley Heights, has a view that vividly recalls the neighborhood of Richmond, England. Never was the scene more attractive than one day last week when Mr. Glover received several hundred friends. Four hundred feet above sea level, \"Westover\" commands the Blue Ridge on one side and the winding Potomac on the other. The tip of the monument is visible from the ground, while the Capitol may be seen from the top of the house. Truly a beautiful situation with a perennial breeze untainted by malaria''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YA8-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA352&dq=%22wesley+heights%22+c.c.+Glover#v=onepage&q=%22wesley%20heights%22%20c.c.%20Glover&f=false | title=Kate Field's Washington| year=1894}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Diane|title=Washington At Home|year=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|pages=415-432, 492-493|editor=Katharine Smith|chapter=\"Wesley Heights and Spring Valley: Persistency and Consistency\"}}\n{{Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.}}\n\n[[Category:1920s establishments in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in Northwest (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n{{WashingtonDC-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = Wesley Heights\n| native_name             =\n| native_name_lang        = <!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"fr\" for French.

Glover played instrumental roles in the selection and purchase of the site of the soon to be Methodist-affiliated American University just north of Newark Street.<ref>http://wdchumanities.org/docs/08grants/TenleytownNRHP001.pdf</ref> \n\nThe newly named Wesley Height development was divided into plots and some of the plots were sold to prospective home buyers and investors. In 1892, Charles C. Glover acquired all the Wesley Heights plots (block 29, 22 and 21) between New Mexico Street and the then 43rd street, and built his country mansion named Westover.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3852w.ct005293/|title=Wesley Heights, adjoining new Methodist University|author=|date=|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref> By 1908, John Waggaman estate had filed for bankruptcy and Charles Glover was summoned to court to give testimony; the vast majority of Wesley Heights had been mortgaged to the hilt and there was suspicion that John Waggaman and Charles Glover had benefited from nefarious activities pertaining to the financing and acquisition of Wesley Heights and other large land developments in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/dc_circ_1912_2450_dulany_v_morse|title=Dulany v.

The university declined the offer. \n[[File:Default (4).jpg|thumb|left|Charles Glover offer letter to sell portion of Wesley Heights land to American University]]\n   \nDuring the 1920s, a revitalization effort was initiated by real estate developers W.C. and A.N. Miller with the purchasing of plots (80 acres) in Wesley Heights. W.C. and A.N. Miller  began constructing homes in Wesley Heights, and also in the neighboring communities of [[Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.|Spring Valley]] and [[American University Park]].  W.C. and A.N. Miller planned development in Wesley Heights was one of the first master-[[planned communities]] in the [[United States]] and featured such services as a [[Public transport|shuttle]] to the [[Wisconsin Avenue]] [[Washington streetcars|streetcar]] and a community club house.\n\n==Wesley Heights' Geography before the 1920 revitalization==\nNot much is known about the geography of Wesley Heights before W.C. and A.N. Miller began building houses on Wesley Heights. Nevertheless, in 1894 [[Kate Field]], the renown American journalist, notes in her published periodical journal (Kate Field's Washington), a vivid description of Wesley Heights from a viewpoint on Charles Glover's estate. According to Kate Field: \n\n''\"Whoever stands on the broad piazza of Mr. and Mrs. C.C Glover's country home, \"Westover\", on Wesley Heights, has a view that vividly recalls the neighborhood of Richmond, England. Never was the scene more attractive than one day last week when Mr. Glover received several hundred friends. Four hundred feet above sea level, \"Westover\" commands the Blue Ridge on one side and the winding Potomac on the other. The tip of the monument is visible from the ground, while the Capitol may be seen from the top of the house. Truly a beautiful situation with a perennial breeze untainted by malaria''<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YA8-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA352&dq=%22wesley+heights%22+c.c.+Glover#v=onepage&q=%22wesley%20heights%22%20c.c.%20Glover&f=false | title=Kate Field's Washington| year=1894}}</ref>.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Diane|title=Washington At Home|year=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|pages=415-432, 492-493|editor=Katharine Smith|chapter=\"Wesley Heights and Spring Valley: Persistency and Consistency\"}}\n{{Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.}}\n\n[[Category:1920s establishments in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in Northwest (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n{{WashingtonDC-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Heights"}

Some of the regression tools are:\n\n* M5Rules (M5' algorithm presented in terms of mathematical function without a tree)\n* DecisionStump (same as M5' but with a single number output in each node)\n* M5P (splitting domain into successive binary regions and then fit linear models to each tree node)\n* RandomForest (several model trees combined)\n* REPTree (Reduced Error Pruning Tree, several model trees combined)\n* ZeroR (the average value of outputs)\n* DecisionRules (splits data into several regions based on a single independent variable and provides a single output value for each range)\n* LinearRegression\n* SMOreg (sequential minimal optimization for support vector regression)\n* SimpleLinearRegression (uses an intercept and only 1 input variable for multivariate data)\n* MultiLayerPerceptron (neural network)\n* GaussianProcesses\n\n== Extension packages ==\nIn version 3.7.2, a package manager was added to allow the easier installation of extension packages.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/packages/ |title=weka-wiki - Packages |accessdate=27 January 2020 }}</ref>\nSome functionality that used to be included with Weka prior to this version has since been moved into such extension packages, but this change also makes it easier for others to contribute extensions to Weka and to maintain the software, as this modular architecture allows independent updates of the Weka core and individual extensions.\n\n==History==\n\n* In 1993, the [[University of Waikato]] in [[New Zealand]] began development of the original version of Weka, which became a mix of Tcl/Tk, C, and Makefiles.\n* In 1997, the decision was made to redevelop Weka from scratch in Java, including implementations of modeling algorithms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/publications/1999/99IHW-EF-LT-MH-GH-SJC-Tools-Java.pdf |title=Weka: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations |accessdate=2007-06-26 |first1=Ian H. |last1=Witten |first2=Eibe |last2=Frank |first3=Len |last3=Trigg |first4=Mark A. |last4=Hall |first5=Geoffrey |last5=Holmes |first6=Sally Jo |last6=Cunningham |year=1999 |work=Proceedings of the ICONIP/ANZIIS/ANNES'99 Workshop on Emerging Knowledge Engineering and Connectionist-Based Information Systems |pages=192\u2013196 }}</ref>\n* In 2005, Weka received the [[SIGKDD]] Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Service Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2005/n13/2i.html |title=KDnuggets news on SIGKDD Service Award 2005 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |first1=Gregory I. |last1=Piatetsky-Shapiro |author-link1=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |date=2005-06-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigkdd/awards_service.php |title=Overview of SIGKDD Service Award winners |accessdate=2007-06-25 |year=2005 }}</ref>\n* In 2006, [[Pentaho]] Corporation acquired an exclusive licence to use Weka for [[business intelligence]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.pentaho.com/pentaho-acquires-weka-project |title=Pentaho Acquires Weka Project |work=Pentaho |access-date=2018-02-06 |language=en }}</ref> It forms the data mining and [[predictive analytics]] component of the Pentaho business intelligence suite.

Animal foods include [[earthworm]]s, [[larva]]e, beetles, [[weta]], ants, grass grubs, slugs, snails, insect eggs, [[woodlouse|slater]]s, frogs, spiders, rats, mice, and small birds.

[[Bird nest|Nest]]s are made on the ground under the cover of thick vegetation, and built by making grass (or similar material) into a bowl to hold about four eggs. On average, female weka lay three creamy or pinkish eggs blotched with brown and mauve. Both sexes incubate. The chicks hatch after a month, and are fed by both parents until fully grown between six and ten weeks.<ref name=\"e1966\" /><ref name=\"teara\" />\n\n==Conservation status==\nWeka are classed as a [[vulnerable species]]. The [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation's]] weka recovery plan, approved in 1999, aims to improve the conservation status of threatened weka, clarify the status of data deficient weka, maintain the non-threatened status of other weka, and eventually restore all weka to their traditional ranges as a significant component of the ecosystems.<ref name=\"docwork\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/weka/docs-work/|title=DOC's work with weka: Native land birds conservation |publisher=Doc.govt.nz |date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>\n\nWeka are problematic in conservation; some subspecies are threatened, but have been a problem to other threatened wildlife on offshore islands, especially when introduced to an island that they would not naturally inhabit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/birds/land-birds/weka/facts/ |title=Facts: Weka: Native land birds: Conservation |publisher=Doc.govt.nz |date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Weka are unable to withstand the current pressures faced in both the [[North Island]] and [[South Island]].

Drought has been implicated in the disappearance of weka from some areas. In some regions, motor vehicles cause a significant amount of [[roadkill]] death. Pest control operations sometimes kill weka, as they have ground foraging habits vulnerable to poison baits, and traps are laid in a way that weka can reach.

Applications created with WebObjects can be deployed as web sites, Java [[Webstart|WebStart]] desktop applications, and/or standards-based [[web services]].\n\nThe deployment [[Runtime system|runtime]] is pure Java, allowing developers to deploy WebObjects applications on platforms that support Java. One can use the included WebObjects [[Java SE]] application server or deploy on third-party [[Java EE]] application servers such as [[JBoss]], [[Apache Tomcat]], [[Oracle WebLogic Server|WebLogic Server]] or IBM [[WebSphere]].\n\n==History==\n\nWebObjects was created by [[NeXT|NeXT Software, Inc.]], first publicly demonstrated at the Object World conference in 1995 and released to the public in March 1996. The time and cost benefits of rapid, object-oriented development attracted major corporations to WebObjects in the early days of [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]], with clients including [[BBC News]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell Computer]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[DreamWorks SKG]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[GE Capital]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Motorola]]. However, following [[NeXT]]'s merger into [[Apple Inc.]] in 1997, WebObjects' public profile languished. Many early adopters later switched to alternative technologies, and currently Apple remains the biggest client for the software, relying on it to power parts of its online [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]] and the [[iTunes Store]] \u2014 WebObjects' highest-profile implementation.\n\nWebObjects was part of Apple's strategy of using software to drive hardware sales, and in 2000 the price was lowered from $50,000 (for the full deployment license) to $699. From May 2001 WebObjects was included with [[macOS Server|Mac OS X Server]], and no longer required a license key for development or deployment.\n\nWebObjects transitioned from a stand-alone product to be a part of [[macOS|Mac OS X]] with the release of version 5.3 in June 2005. The developer tools and frameworks, which previously sold for US$699, were bundled with Apple's [[Xcode]] [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]. Support for other platforms, such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], was then discontinued. Apple said that it would further integrate WebObjects development tools with [[Xcode]] in future releases. This included a new EOModeler Plugin for Xcode. This strategy, however, was not pursued further.\n\nIn 2006, Apple announced the deprecation of Mac OS X's Cocoa-Java bridge with the release of Xcode 2.4 at the August 2006 Worldwide Developers Conference, and with it all dependent features, including the entire suite of WebObjects developer applications: EOModeler, EOModeler Plugin, WebObjects Builder, WebServices Assistant, RuleEditor and WOALauncher. Apple had decided to concentrate its engineering resources on the runtime engine of WebObjects, leaving the future responsibility for developer applications with the open-source community. The main open-source alternative \u2014 the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] with the WOLips suite of plugins \u2014 had matured to such an extent that its capabilities had, in many areas, surpassed those of Apple's own tools, which had not seen significant updates for a number of years.\n\nApple promised to provide assistance to the community in its efforts to extend such tools and develop new ones. In a posting to the webobjects-dev mailing list,<ref>[http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2006/Aug/msg01144.html Apple Mailing Lists: RE: Xcode 2.4 Deprecation Announcements] by Daryl Lee</ref> Daryl Lee from Apple's WebObjects team publicly disclosed the company's new strategy for WebObjects. It promised to \"make WebObjects the best server-side runtime environment\" by:\n\n* Improving performance, manageability, and standards compliance\n\n* Making WebObjects work well with Ant and the most popular IDEs, including Xcode and Eclipse\n\n* Opening and making public all standards and formats that WebObjects depends upon\n\nWebObjects 5.4, which shipped with [[Mac OS X Leopard]] in October 2007, removed the license key requirement for both development and deployment of WebObjects applications on all platforms. All methods for checking license limitations were then deprecated.\n\nIn 2009, Apple stopped issuing new releases of WebObjects outside Apple. The community decided to continue development with Project Wonder, an open-source framework built on top of the core WebObjects frameworks and extends them. For example, Project Wonder has updated development tools and provides a [[REST]] framework that was not part of the original WebObjects package.\n\nThough once included in the default installation of Mac OS X Server, WebObjects was no longer installed by default starting with [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server]] and shortly after, Apple ceased promoting or selling WebObjects. As of 2016, WebObjects is actively supported by its developer community, the \"WOCommunity Association\", by extending the core frameworks and providing fixes with Project Wonder. The organization last held a Worldwide WebObjects Developer Conference, WOWODC, in 2013.<ref>[http://WOCommunity.org WebObjects Community Association] (WOCommunity) (official web site).</ref><ref>[http://www.wocommunity.org/wowodc12/](WOWODC '12) official web site.</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, Apple confirmed that WebObjects had been discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leswing|first1=Kif|title=Apple officially killed one of Steve Jobs' favorite projects|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-officially-discontinues-webobjects-2016-5|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Tools==\nAs of 2016 most WebObjects architects and engineers are using the tools being developed by the WebObjects community. These tools run within the [[Eclipse IDE]] and are open-source. The WebObjects plug-ins for Eclipse are known as [http://wiki.wocommunity.org/display/WOL/Home WOLips].\n\nBuilding WebObjects frameworks and applications for deployment is typically achieved using the WOProject set of tools for [[Apache Ant]] or [[Apache Maven]]. These tools are distributed with WOLips.\n\n==Core frameworks==\nA WebObjects application is essentially a server-side executable, created by combining prebuilt application framework objects with the developer's own custom code. WebObjects' frameworks can be broken down into three core parts:\n\n* '''The WebObjects Framework (WOF)''' is at the highest level of the system. It is responsible for the application's user interface and state management. It uses a template-based approach to take that object graph and turn it into [[HTML]], or other tag-based information display standards, such as [[XML]] or [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]]. It provides an environment where you can use and create reusable components. Components are chunks of presentation (HTML) and functionality (Java code) often with a parameter list to enhance reusability. WebObjects Builder is used to create the [[web template|HTML-templates]] and creates the .wod-file linking, for instance, a Java String object to interface objects like an input field in a web form.\n\n* '''The [[Enterprise Objects Framework]] (EOF)''' is, perhaps, the hallmark feature of WebObjects. EOF communicates with [[Relational database|relational databases]] and turns database rows into an object graph. Using EOModeler the developer can create an abstraction of the database in the forms of Java objects. In order to access or insert information into the database the developer simply accesses the Java Enterprise Objects (EOs) from their business logic. After that EOF manages the Enterprise Objects and automatically creates the required [[SQL]]-code to commit the changes to the database.\n\n* '''Java Foundation'''. Both Enterprise Objects and WebObjects rest on the aptly named Java Foundation classes. This framework contains the fundamental data structure implementations and utilities used throughout the rest of WebObjects. Examples include basic value and collection classes, such as [[Array data type|arrays]], [[Associative array|dictionaries]] (objects that contain key-value pairs) and formatting classes. Java Foundation is similar to the Foundation framework contained in Apple's [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa API]] for [[macOS]] desktop applications, however Java Foundation is written in Pure Java as opposed to Cocoa's Objective-C (with its Java bridge runtime wrapper). Foundation classes are prefixed with the letters \"NS\" (a reference to their [[NeXTSTEP|NeXTSTEP OS]] heritage). Since the transition of WebObjects to Java in 2000, the functionality of many of Apple's Java Foundation classes is replicated in Sun's own [[JDK]]. However, they persist largely for reasons of backwards-compatibility and developers are free to use whichever frameworks they prefer.\n\n==Rules-Based Rapid Application Development (RBRAD)==\nWebObjects features a set of rapid development technologies that can automatically create a Web application without the need to write any [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code. Given a model file for a database, WebObjects will create an interface supporting nine common database tasks, including querying, editing and listing. Such applications are useful for prototyping or administering a database, perhaps to check [[Relational model|relationships]] or to seed the database with data.\n\nThe user interface is generated dynamically, on-the-fly at runtime using a rules-based system\u2014no code is generated. Consequently, one can modify an application's configuration at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]] (using an assistant program) without recompiling or relaunching the application.\n\nDevelopers can utilize one of three different technologies, depending upon the type of interface they wish to employ:\n\n* '''Direct To Web (D2W)''' allows developers to rapidly create an HTML-based Web application that accesses a database.\n\n* '''Direct To Java Client''' allows developers to rapidly create a client desktop application using the [[Swing (Java)|Java Swing]] toolkit. An advantage of Java Client applications is that they can take advantage of the processing power of the client computer to perform operations such as sorting a list of items received from the server.\n\n* '''Direct To Web Services''' allows developers to rapidly develop Web service-based applications that provide access to a data store.\n\n===Advantages of RBRAD===\n\n* Vastly decreased development and debugging time;\n\n* Increased stability through the use of highly exercised code;\n\n* By using the information contained in the data model file, applications will not violate database integrity. Normally you would have to write code to avoid such situations and handle errors generated by bad data;\n\n* Fully utilizes the validation services provided by WebObjects and Enterprise Objects.<!-- sounds like a brochure - is this text really licensed under GFDL, and really encyclopedic -->\n\n==Java compatibility==\nWebObjects is a 100% Java product with the following Java-based features:\n*'''Deployment:''' Applications can be deployed on any operating system that has Java 1.3 or later. Many developers have successfully deployed on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and various [[Linux]] systems such as [[Red Hat Linux]], [[Debian]] and [[SUSE Linux|SUSE]]. Applications can also be hosted on any [[Java EE]] compatible application server such as [[JBoss]].\n*'''Java EE integration:''' WebObjects applications can be packaged in a single directory (an exploded .war file) that make it easier to deploy to a [[Java EE]] [[Java Servlet|servlet]] container.\n*'''JDBC:''' Since WebObjects uses [[JDBC]] for database connectivity any [[DBMS]] that has a JDBC-driver can be used within WebObjects.\n*'''Swing interface:''' WebObjects applications can be delivered to the user as a \"Java Client application\" or as a Java applet.\n\n==Version history==\nWebObjects was originally released by [[NeXT|NeXT Computer]] in March 1996, but was acquired by [[Apple Inc.]] with their acquisition of NeXT in December of that year.\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n:'''1.0''' \u2014 March 28, 1996\n:*Debut release.\n:'''2.0''' \u2014 June 25, 1996\n:*Pre-release version of WebObjects Builder application.\n:'''3.0''' \u2014 November 1996\n:'''3.1'''\n:*Supports a subset of the Java APIs (NT only).\n:'''3.5''' \u2014 December 1997\n:*Enhanced Java support (NT only): all objects and components can be worked on as a set of Java APIs based on a complete implementation of the JDK 1.1.3.\n:'''4.0''' \u2014 September 1998\n:*First version of WebObjects to run on the Mac platform \u2014 specifically [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] (a public release of the beta OS formerly code-named '[[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]]').\n:*[[OPENSTEP]] 4.2 OS no longer supported; Windows NT now uses a new version of the [[OpenStep]] base of libraries and binary support called Yellow Box.\n:*Direct actions introduced whereby actions can be sent directly to an object that can handle it, allowing for simpler, static URLs.\n:*Direct to Web code-free development assistant introduced.\n:*WebObjects and Enterprise Objects Framework provide thread-safe APIs.

WOWODC 2010 was held in Montreal on August 27, 28 and 29, 2010. WOWODC 2011 was held in Montreal on July 1, 2 and 3 in 2011. WOWODC 2012 was held in Montreal on June 30, July 1 and 2, 2012.

WOWODC 2016 was held in Montr\u00e9al on June 24, 25 and 26\n\n==Open-source alternatives==\nInterest in OpenSource alternatives to WebObjects that use the [[Objective-C]] language grew with WebObjects' move from Objective-C (last version WO 4.5.1) to Java (first version WO 5.0). The two frameworks available are SOPE,<ref name=\"sope\">[http://sope.opengroupware.org/ SOPE Frameworks for Objective-C]</ref> which has been used as the basis of the [[OpenGroupware.org]] groupware server for about eight years, and [[GNUstepWeb]], which is part of the [[GNUstep]] project. Open-source rewrites of the EOF frameworks also exist (AJRDatabase, GDL2).<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ajrdatabase/ AJRDatabase]</ref><ref>[http://www.gnustep.org/experience/GDL2.html GDL2]</ref>\n\nThere are also Java-based alternatives:\n\n* '''Wotonomy''' is a project, hosted on [[Sourceforge]], that implements a clean-room, open-source version of the WebObjects 5.x system.<ref>[http://wotonomy.sourceforge.net/ Wotonomy Project]</ref> It provides a near-complete implementation of the MVC web-framework, as well as partial implementations of Foundation, Control, and Data layers, and other features. It is sufficiently functional for low-transaction volume, single-source database applications. While the project's structure was re-organized in 2006 around an [[Apache Maven]] build infrastructure<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=541649 \"Wotonomy moves to maven, removes non-free software\"] - Christian Gruber</ref> and migrated to the [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] [[revision control]] system,<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=550278 \"Wotonomy moves subversion\"] - Christian Gruber</ref> there has not been any substantial update to the codebase since 2003.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=248937 \"Wotonomy web is coming together\"] - Micheal Powers</ref>\n\n*[[Apache Tapestry|'''Apache Tapestry''']] has a design and philosophy similar to that of WebObjects.<ref>Tapestry In Action - Preface ({{ISBN|9781932394115}})</ref> Tapestry is frequently combined with [[Apache Cayenne]], a persistence framework inspired by [[Enterprise Objects Framework|EOF]].\n\n* '''GETobjects''' is another framework<ref>[http://www.getobjects.org/ GETobjects]</ref> with an API similar to WebObjects 5.x that is related to SOPE.<ref name=\"sope\" />\n\nAn attempt to do a [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] version based on SOPE / GETobjects is available as SwiftObjects.<ref>[http://www.swiftobjects.org SwiftObjects]</ref> The implementation for Swift 4 is limited due to the reflection capabilities of that Swift version.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of application servers]]\n* [[Comparison of web frameworks]]\n* [[UM.SiteMaker]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090423021619/http://developer.apple.com/tools/webobjects/ WebObjects at Apple Developer] (Archived from [https://developer.apple.com/webobjects the original])\n* [http://www.wocommunity.org/ Official WebObjects Community Website]\n\n{{Web frameworks}}\n{{Apple software}}\n{{NeXT Computer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Webobjects}}\n[[Category:Apple Inc. software]]\n[[Category:Java enterprise platform]]\n[[Category:Web frameworks]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Java web application server and framework originally developed by NeXT Software}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{primary sources|date=November 2011}}\n\n{{Infobox software\n| name = WebObjects\n| screenshot = WebObjects 5.2 packaging.jpg\n| caption = WebObjects 5.2 packaging\n| author = [[NeXT|NeXT Software Inc.]]\n| developer = [[Apple Inc.]]\n| released = {{Start date and age|1996|03|28}}\n| discontinued = Yes\n| latest release version = 5.4.3\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2008|09|15}}\n| programming language = [[Java (programming language)|Java]]\n| operating system = [[macOS|OS X]]\n| genre = Web [[application server]]\n| license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]]\n}}\n'''WebObjects''' is a [[Java (software platform)|Java]] web [[application server]] and a server-based [[web application framework]] originally developed by [[NeXT|NeXT Software, Inc.]] As of 2009 the software has been independently maintained by a volunteer community.\n\nWebObject's hallmark features are its [[Object-oriented programming|object-orientation]], database connectivity, and prototyping tools. Applications created with WebObjects can be deployed as web sites, Java [[Webstart|WebStart]] desktop applications, and/or standards-based [[web services]].\n\nThe deployment [[Runtime system|runtime]] is pure Java, allowing developers to deploy WebObjects applications on platforms that support Java. One can use the included WebObjects [[Java SE]] application server or deploy on third-party [[Java EE]] application servers such as [[JBoss]], [[Apache Tomcat]], [[Oracle WebLogic Server|WebLogic Server]] or IBM [[WebSphere]].\n\n==History==\n\nWebObjects was created by [[NeXT|NeXT Software, Inc.]], first publicly demonstrated at the Object World conference in 1995 and released to the public in March 1996. The time and cost benefits of rapid, object-oriented development attracted major corporations to WebObjects in the early days of [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]], with clients including [[BBC News]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell Computer]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[DreamWorks SKG]], [[Fannie Mae]], [[GE Capital]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Motorola]]. However, following [[NeXT]]'s merger into [[Apple Inc.]] in 1997, WebObjects' public profile languished. Many early adopters later switched to alternative technologies, and currently Apple remains the biggest client for the software, relying on it to power parts of its online [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]] and the [[iTunes Store]] \u2014 WebObjects' highest-profile implementation.\n\nWebObjects was part of Apple's strategy of using software to drive hardware sales, and in 2000 the price was lowered from $50,000 (for the full deployment license) to $699. From May 2001 WebObjects was included with [[macOS Server|Mac OS X Server]], and no longer required a license key for development or deployment.\n\nWebObjects transitioned from a stand-alone product to be a part of [[macOS|Mac OS X]] with the release of version 5.3 in June 2005. The developer tools and frameworks, which previously sold for US$699, were bundled with Apple's [[Xcode]] [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]. Support for other platforms, such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], was then discontinued. Apple said that it would further integrate WebObjects development tools with [[Xcode]] in future releases. This included a new EOModeler Plugin for Xcode. This strategy, however, was not pursued further.\n\nIn 2006, Apple announced the deprecation of Mac OS X's Cocoa-Java bridge with the release of Xcode 2.4 at the August 2006 Worldwide Developers Conference, and with it all dependent features, including the entire suite of WebObjects developer applications: EOModeler, EOModeler Plugin, WebObjects Builder, WebServices Assistant, RuleEditor and WOALauncher. Apple had decided to concentrate its engineering resources on the runtime engine of WebObjects, leaving the future responsibility for developer applications with the open-source community. The main open-source alternative \u2014 the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] with the WOLips suite of plugins \u2014 had matured to such an extent that its capabilities had, in many areas, surpassed those of Apple's own tools, which had not seen significant updates for a number of years.\n\nApple promised to provide assistance to the community in its efforts to extend such tools and develop new ones. In a posting to the webobjects-dev mailing list,<ref>[http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2006/Aug/msg01144.html Apple Mailing Lists: RE: Xcode 2.4 Deprecation Announcements] by Daryl Lee</ref> Daryl Lee from Apple's WebObjects team publicly disclosed the company's new strategy for WebObjects. It promised to \"make WebObjects the best server-side runtime environment\" by:\n\n* Improving performance, manageability, and standards compliance\n\n* Making WebObjects work well with Ant and the most popular IDEs, including Xcode and Eclipse\n\n* Opening and making public all standards and formats that WebObjects depends upon\n\nWebObjects 5.4, which shipped with [[Mac OS X Leopard]] in October 2007, removed the license key requirement for both development and deployment of WebObjects applications on all platforms. All methods for checking license limitations were then deprecated.\n\nIn 2009, Apple stopped issuing new releases of WebObjects outside Apple. The community decided to continue development with Project Wonder, an open-source framework built on top of the core WebObjects frameworks and extends them. For example, Project Wonder has updated development tools and provides a [[REST]] framework that was not part of the original WebObjects package.\n\nThough once included in the default installation of Mac OS X Server, WebObjects was no longer installed by default starting with [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server]] and shortly after, Apple ceased promoting or selling WebObjects. As of 2016, WebObjects is actively supported by its developer community, the \"WOCommunity Association\", by extending the core frameworks and providing fixes with Project Wonder. The organization last held a Worldwide WebObjects Developer Conference, WOWODC, in 2013.<ref>[http://WOCommunity.org WebObjects Community Association] (WOCommunity) (official web site).</ref><ref>[http://www.wocommunity.org/wowodc12/](WOWODC '12) official web site.</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, Apple confirmed that WebObjects had been discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leswing|first1=Kif|title=Apple officially killed one of Steve Jobs' favorite projects|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-officially-discontinues-webobjects-2016-5|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Tools==\nAs of 2016 most WebObjects architects and engineers are using the tools being developed by the WebObjects community. These tools run within the [[Eclipse IDE]] and are open-source. The WebObjects plug-ins for Eclipse are known as [http://wiki.wocommunity.org/display/WOL/Home WOLips].\n\nBuilding WebObjects frameworks and applications for deployment is typically achieved using the WOProject set of tools for [[Apache Ant]] or [[Apache Maven]]. These tools are distributed with WOLips.\n\n==Core frameworks==\nA WebObjects application is essentially a server-side executable, created by combining prebuilt application framework objects with the developer's own custom code. WebObjects' frameworks can be broken down into three core parts:\n\n* '''The WebObjects Framework (WOF)''' is at the highest level of the system. It is responsible for the application's user interface and state management. It uses a template-based approach to take that object graph and turn it into [[HTML]], or other tag-based information display standards, such as [[XML]] or [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]]. It provides an environment where you can use and create reusable components. Components are chunks of presentation (HTML) and functionality (Java code) often with a parameter list to enhance reusability. WebObjects Builder is used to create the [[web template|HTML-templates]] and creates the .wod-file linking, for instance, a Java String object to interface objects like an input field in a web form.\n\n* '''The [[Enterprise Objects Framework]] (EOF)''' is, perhaps, the hallmark feature of WebObjects. EOF communicates with [[Relational database|relational databases]] and turns database rows into an object graph. Using EOModeler the developer can create an abstraction of the database in the forms of Java objects. In order to access or insert information into the database the developer simply accesses the Java Enterprise Objects (EOs) from their business logic. After that EOF manages the Enterprise Objects and automatically creates the required [[SQL]]-code to commit the changes to the database.\n\n* '''Java Foundation'''. Both Enterprise Objects and WebObjects rest on the aptly named Java Foundation classes. This framework contains the fundamental data structure implementations and utilities used throughout the rest of WebObjects. Examples include basic value and collection classes, such as [[Array data type|arrays]], [[Associative array|dictionaries]] (objects that contain key-value pairs) and formatting classes. Java Foundation is similar to the Foundation framework contained in Apple's [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa API]] for [[macOS]] desktop applications, however Java Foundation is written in Pure Java as opposed to Cocoa's Objective-C (with its Java bridge runtime wrapper). Foundation classes are prefixed with the letters \"NS\" (a reference to their [[NeXTSTEP|NeXTSTEP OS]] heritage). Since the transition of WebObjects to Java in 2000, the functionality of many of Apple's Java Foundation classes is replicated in Sun's own [[JDK]]. However, they persist largely for reasons of backwards-compatibility and developers are free to use whichever frameworks they prefer.\n\n==Rules-Based Rapid Application Development (RBRAD)==\nWebObjects features a set of rapid development technologies that can automatically create a Web application without the need to write any [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code. Given a model file for a database, WebObjects will create an interface supporting nine common database tasks, including querying, editing and listing. Such applications are useful for prototyping or administering a database, perhaps to check [[Relational model|relationships]] or to seed the database with data.\n\nThe user interface is generated dynamically, on-the-fly at runtime using a rules-based system\u2014no code is generated. Consequently, one can modify an application's configuration at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]] (using an assistant program) without recompiling or relaunching the application.\n\nDevelopers can utilize one of three different technologies, depending upon the type of interface they wish to employ:\n\n* '''Direct To Web (D2W)''' allows developers to rapidly create an HTML-based Web application that accesses a database.\n\n* '''Direct To Java Client''' allows developers to rapidly create a client desktop application using the [[Swing (Java)|Java Swing]] toolkit. An advantage of Java Client applications is that they can take advantage of the processing power of the client computer to perform operations such as sorting a list of items received from the server.\n\n* '''Direct To Web Services''' allows developers to rapidly develop Web service-based applications that provide access to a data store.\n\n===Advantages of RBRAD===\n\n* Vastly decreased development and debugging time;\n\n* Increased stability through the use of highly exercised code;\n\n* By using the information contained in the data model file, applications will not violate database integrity. Normally you would have to write code to avoid such situations and handle errors generated by bad data;\n\n* Fully utilizes the validation services provided by WebObjects and Enterprise Objects.<!-- sounds like a brochure - is this text really licensed under GFDL, and really encyclopedic -->\n\n==Java compatibility==\nWebObjects is a 100% Java product with the following Java-based features:\n*'''Deployment:''' Applications can be deployed on any operating system that has Java 1.3 or later. Many developers have successfully deployed on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and various [[Linux]] systems such as [[Red Hat Linux]], [[Debian]] and [[SUSE Linux|SUSE]]. Applications can also be hosted on any [[Java EE]] compatible application server such as [[JBoss]].\n*'''Java EE integration:''' WebObjects applications can be packaged in a single directory (an exploded .war file) that make it easier to deploy to a [[Java EE]] [[Java Servlet|servlet]] container.\n*'''JDBC:''' Since WebObjects uses [[JDBC]] for database connectivity any [[DBMS]] that has a JDBC-driver can be used within WebObjects.\n*'''Swing interface:''' WebObjects applications can be delivered to the user as a \"Java Client application\" or as a Java applet.\n\n==Version history==\nWebObjects was originally released by [[NeXT|NeXT Computer]] in March 1996, but was acquired by [[Apple Inc.]] with their acquisition of NeXT in December of that year.\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n:'''1.0''' \u2014 March 28, 1996\n:*Debut release.\n:'''2.0''' \u2014 June 25, 1996\n:*Pre-release version of WebObjects Builder application.\n:'''3.0''' \u2014 November 1996\n:'''3.1'''\n:*Supports a subset of the Java APIs (NT only).\n:'''3.5''' \u2014 December 1997\n:*Enhanced Java support (NT only): all objects and components can be worked on as a set of Java APIs based on a complete implementation of the JDK 1.1.3.\n:'''4.0''' \u2014 September 1998\n:*First version of WebObjects to run on the Mac platform \u2014 specifically [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] (a public release of the beta OS formerly code-named '[[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]]').\n:*[[OPENSTEP]] 4.2 OS no longer supported; Windows NT now uses a new version of the [[OpenStep]] base of libraries and binary support called Yellow Box.\n:*Direct actions introduced whereby actions can be sent directly to an object that can handle it, allowing for simpler, static URLs.\n:*Direct to Web code-free development assistant introduced.\n:*WebObjects and Enterprise Objects Framework provide thread-safe APIs.
