Those services include:\n* Waffle.io: Project management for software teams. Automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across all of your repositories in GitHub.\n* Rollbar: Integrate with GitHub to provide real time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting. It is compatible with all well used code languages, such as [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[.NET]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Node.js]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].\n* Codebeat: For automated code analysis specialized in web and mobile developers.

The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019 and currently the project accepts wait list registrations. [[The Verge]] said that GitHub Sponsors \"works exactly like Patreon\" because \"developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they\u2019ll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work\" except with \"zero fees to use the program\". Furthermore, GitHub offer incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs, and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users still can use other similar services like [[Patreon]] and Open Collective and link to their own websites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637344/github-sponsors-patreon-style-crowdfunding-open-source|title=GitHub launches Sponsors, a Patreon-style funding tool for developers|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2019-05-23|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/|title=Announcing GitHub Sponsors: a new way to contribute to open source|date=2019-05-23|website=The GitHub Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Harassment allegations ===\nIn March 2014, GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner and his wife Theresa engaged in a pattern of harassment against her that led to her leaving the company.<ref name=\"Valleywag March 2014\">{{cite web|url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/meet-the-married-duo-behind-techs-biggest-new-harassme-1545685104|title=Meet the Married Duo Behind Tech's Biggest New Harassment Scandal|last1=Biddle|first1=Sam|last2=Tiku|first2=Nitasha|date=March 17, 2014|publisher=Gawker|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317225437/http://valleywag.gawker.com/meet-the-married-duo-behind-techs-biggest-new-harassme-1545685104|archivedate=March 17, 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 17, 2014|newspaper=[[Vallywag]]|df=dmy}}</ref> In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath's allegations.<ref name=\"NYTResigns\">{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/github-founder-resigns-after-investigation/?_php=true&_type=blogs&hp&_r=0|title=GitHub Founder Resigns After Investigation|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|date=April 21, 2014|work=Bits|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/21/github-denies-allegations-of-gender-based-harassment-co-founder-preston-werner-resigns/|title=GitHub Denies Allegations Of \"Gender-Based Harassment,\" Co-Founder Preston-Werner Resigns|last=Wilhelm|first=Alex|date=April 21, 2014|work=TechCrunch}}</ref> However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims.
