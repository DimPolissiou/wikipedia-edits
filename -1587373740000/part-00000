Two works (his first string quartet and a berceuse for piano) were composed before he fled to the [[Soviet Union]] at the outbreak of [[Second World War|World War II]]. His parents and younger sister Esther, who remained behind, were interned at the [[Lodz ghetto]] and subsequently perished in the [[Trawniki concentration camp]]. Weinberg first settled in [[Minsk]], where he studied composition for the first time at the Conservatory there. At the outbreak of World War II on Soviet territory, Weinberg was evacuated to [[Tashkent]] (Central Asia), where he wrote works for the [[opera]], as well as met and married [[Solomon Mikhoels]]' daughter Natalia Vovsi. There he also met [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] who was impressed by his talent and became his close friend. Meeting Shostakovich had a profound effect on the younger man, who said later that, \"It was as if I had been born anew\".<ref name=\"Nikitina2009\">Nikitina, Lyudmilla Dmitriyevna (2009), \"Weinberg [Vaynberg], Moisey [Mieczys\u0142aw] Samuilovich\", Grove Music Online, https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.29094</ref> In 1943, he moved to Moscow at Shostakovich's urging.\n\n===Later life in Russia===\n\nOnce in Moscow, Weinberg began to settle down and to work energetically, as evidenced by his increasing opus numbers: approximately 30 works from 1943 until 1948. Several of Weinberg's works were banned during the [[Zhdanovshchina]] of 1948, and, as a result, he was almost entirely ignored by the Soviet musical establishment; for a time he could make a living only by composing for the theatre and circus.  On 13 January 1948 Weinberg's father-in-law Mikhoels was assassinated in Minsk on Stalin's orders; shortly after Mikhoels's murder, Soviet agents began following Weinberg. In February 1953, he was arrested on charges of \"Jewish [[bourgeois nationalism]]\" in relation to the murder of his father-in-law as a part of the so-called \"[[Doctors' plot]]\": Shostakovich allegedly wrote to [[Lavrenti Beria]] to intercede on Weinberg's behalf, as well as agreeing to look after Weinberg's daughter if his wife were also arrested. In the event, he was saved by Stalin's death the following month, and he was officially rehabilitated shortly afterwards.<ref>Wilson, Elizabeth (2006), \"Shostakovich: A Life Remembered\", Faber, pp. 227-231.</ref>\n\nThereafter Weinberg continued to live in Moscow, composing and occasionally performing as a pianist. He and Shostakovich lived near to one another, sharing ideas on a daily basis.   Besides the admiration which Shostakovich frequently expressed for Weinberg's works, they were taken up by some of Russia's foremost performers and conductors, including [[Emil Gilels]], [[Leonid Kogan]], [[Kirill Kondrashin]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], [[Kurt Sanderling]], and [[Thomas Sanderling]].\n\n===Final years and posthumous reception===\n\nTowards the end of his life, Weinberg suffered from [[Crohn's disease]] and remained housebound for the last three years, although he continued to compose. He converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] on 3 January 1996, less than two months before his death in [[Moscow]].<ref>Reilly, Robert R.

Since then, numerous other labels have recorded Weinberg's music, including [[Naxos Records|Naxos]], [[Chandos Records|Chandos]], [[ECM Records|ECM]] and [[Deutsche Grammophon]].\n\nWeinberg's works sometimes have a strong element of commemoration, with reference to his formative years in Warsaw and to the war which ended that earlier life. Typically, however, this darkness serves as a background to the finding of peace through [[catharsis]]. This desire for harmony is also evident in his musical style; Lyudmilla Nikitina emphasizes the \"[[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classical]], rationalist clarity and proportion\" of his works.<ref name=\"Nikitina2009\" />\n\nMore generally, Weinberg's style can be described as [[Contemporary classical music|modern]] yet accessible. His [[Harmony|harmonic language]] is usually based on an expanded/free [[tonality]] mixed with occasional [[polytonality]] (e.g. as in the Twentieth Symphony) and [[atonality]] (e.g. as in the Twelfth String Quartet or the 24 Preludes for Solo Cello). His earlier works exhibit neo-[[Romantic music|Romantic]] tendencies and draw significantly on folk-music, whereas his later works, which came with improved social circumstances and greater compositional maturity, are more complex and austere. However, even in these later, more experimental works from the late 1960s, 70s and 80s (e.g. the Third Violin Sonata or the Tenth Symphony), which make liberal use of [[tone clusters]] and other devices, Weinberg retains a keen sense of tradition that variously manifests itself in the use of classical [[Musical form|forms]], more restrained tonality, or lyrical melodic lines. Always masterfully crafted, many of his instrumental works contain highly virtosic writing and make significant technical demands on performers.\n\n===Shostakovich and stylistic influences===\n\nAlthough he never formally studied with Shostakovich, the older composer had an obvious influence on Weinberg's music. This is particularly noticeable in his Twelfth Symphony (1975\u20131976, Op. 114), which is dedicated to the memory of Shostakovich and quotes from a number of the latter's works. Other explicit connections include the pianissimo passage with [[celesta]] which ends the Fifth Symphony (1962, Op. 76), reminiscent of Shostakovich's [[Symphony No. 4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth]]; the quote from one of Shostakovich's [[24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovich)|Preludes and Fugues]] in Weinberg's Sixth Piano Sonata (1960, Op. 73); and numerous, strung-together quotes from Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto and Cello Sonata (4th movement) in Weinberg's 21st Prelude for Solo Cello. These explicit connections should not be interpreted, however, to mean that musical influences went in only one direction (from Shostakovich to Weinberg). Indeed, Shostakovich drew significant inspiration from Weinberg's Seventh Symphony for his [[String Quartet No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth String Quartet]]<ref name=\"Sobolev2014\">{{cite web |last1=Sobolev |first1=Oleg |title=\u041c\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0412\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433: \u0413\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439 [\"Mieczyslaw Weinberg: Glossary\"] |url=https://art1.ru/2014/05/15/mechislav-vajnberg-glossarij-37235 |website=ART-1 |accessdate=23 February 2020 |language=Russian |date=15 May 2014}}</ref>; Shostakovich also drew on some of the ideas in Weinberg's Ninth String Quartet for the slow movement of his Tenth Quartet (opening bars of Weinberg's Ninth), for his [[String Quartet No. 11 (Shostakovich)|Eleventh Quartet]] (first movement of Weinberg's Ninth) and for his [[String Quartet No. 12 (Shostakovich)|Twelfth Quartet]] (F-sharp major ending)<ref>Fanning, David (2010), Notes to String Quartets Vol. 4, CPO CD 777 394-2, p. 15.</ref>; and in his [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|First Cello Concerto]] of 1959, Shostakovich re-used Weinberg's idea of a solo cello motif in the first movement that recurs at the end of the work to impart unity, from Weinberg's Cello Concerto (1948, Op. 43).<ref>Fanning, David (2012), Notes to Cello Concerto and Symphony 20, Chandos CD CHSA 5107, pp. 5 - 6.</ref>\n\nIt is also important to note that Weinberg does not restrict himself to quoting Shostakovich. For example, Weinberg's Trumpet Concerto quotes [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s well-known [[Wedding March]]; his Second Piano Sonata (written in 1942, before moving to Moscow) quotes Haydn; and his Twenty First Symphony quotes a Chopin ballade. Such cryptic quotations are stylistic features shared by both Weinberg and Shostakovich.\n\nThe discussion above highlights that mutual influences and stylistic affinities can be found in many works by the two composers, no doubt as a result of their close friendship and similar compositional views (see also <ref>Elphick, Daniel (2019), \"Music Behind the Iron Curtain: Weinberg and his Polish Contemporaries\", Cambridge University Press.</ref>).\n\nMore general similarities in musical language between Shostakovich and Weinberg include the use of extended melodies, repetitive themes, and methods of developing the musical material.<ref name=\"Nikitina1994\">Nikitina, Lyudmilla (1994), \"\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0433 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u2014 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u2026\" [\"Almost every moment of my life is work\"], \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f [Journal of the Academy of Music] No. 5, pp. 17-24. </ref> However, as Nikitina states, \"already in the 60s it was obvious that Weinberg's style was individual and essentially different from the style of Shostakovich.\"<ref name=\"Nikitina1994\" />.\n\nAlong with Shostakovich, Nikitina identifies Prokofiev, [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] as formative influences.<ref name=\"Nikitina2009\" /> Ethnic influences include not only [[Jewish music]], but also Moldavian, Polish, Uzbek, and Armenian elements.

Two works (his first string quartet and a berceuse for piano) were composed before he fled to the [[Soviet Union]] at the outbreak of [[Second World War|World War II]]. His parents and younger sister Esther, who remained behind, were interned at the [[Lodz ghetto]] and subsequently perished in the [[Trawniki concentration camp]]. Weinberg first settled in [[Minsk]], where he studied composition for the first time at the Conservatory there. At the outbreak of World War II on Soviet territory, Weinberg was evacuated to [[Tashkent]] (Central Asia), where he wrote works for the [[opera]], as well as met and married [[Solomon Mikhoels]]' daughter Natalia Vovsi. There he also met [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] who was impressed by his talent and became his close friend. Meeting Shostakovich had a profound effect on the younger man, who said later that, \"It was as if I had been born anew\".<ref name=\"Nikitina2009\">Nikitina, Lyudmilla Dmitriyevna (2009), \"Weinberg [Vaynberg], Moisey [Mieczys\u0142aw] Samuilovich\", Grove Music Online, https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.29094</ref> In 1943, he moved to Moscow at Shostakovich's urging.\n\n===Later life in Russia===\n\nOnce in Moscow, Weinberg began to settle down and to work energetically, as evidenced by his increasing opus numbers: approximately 30 works from 1943 until 1948. Several of Weinberg's works were banned during the [[Zhdanovshchina]] of 1948, and, as a result, he was almost entirely ignored by the Soviet musical establishment; for a time he could make a living only by composing for the theatre and circus.  On 13 January 1948 Weinberg's father-in-law Mikhoels was assassinated in Minsk on Stalin's orders; shortly after Mikhoels's murder, Soviet agents began following Weinberg. In February 1953, he was arrested on charges of \"Jewish [[bourgeois nationalism]]\" in relation to the murder of his father-in-law as a part of the so-called \"[[Doctors' plot]]\": Shostakovich allegedly wrote to [[Lavrenti Beria]] to intercede on Weinberg's behalf, as well as agreeing to look after Weinberg's daughter if his wife were also arrested. In the event, he was saved by Stalin's death the following month, and he was officially rehabilitated shortly afterwards.<ref>Wilson, Elizabeth (2006), \"Shostakovich: A Life Remembered\", Faber, pp. 227-231.</ref>\n\nThereafter Weinberg continued to live in Moscow, composing and occasionally performing as a pianist. He and Shostakovich lived near to one another, sharing ideas on a daily basis.   Besides the admiration which Shostakovich frequently expressed for Weinberg's works, they were taken up by some of Russia's foremost performers and conductors, including [[Emil Gilels]], [[Leonid Kogan]], [[Kirill Kondrashin]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], [[Kurt Sanderling]], and [[Thomas Sanderling]].\n\n===Final years and posthumous reception===\n\nTowards the end of his life, Weinberg suffered from [[Crohn's disease]] and remained housebound for the last three years, although he continued to compose. He converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] on 3 January 1996, less than two months before his death in [[Moscow]].<ref>Reilly, Robert R.

Since then, numerous other labels have recorded Weinberg's music, including [[Naxos Records|Naxos]], [[Chandos Records|Chandos]], [[ECM Records|ECM]] and [[Deutsche Grammophon]].\n\nWeinberg's works sometimes have a strong element of commemoration, with reference to his formative years in Warsaw and to the war which ended that earlier life. Typically, however, this darkness serves as a background to the finding of peace through [[catharsis]]. This desire for harmony is also evident in his musical style; Lyudmilla Nikitina emphasizes the \"[[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classical]], rationalist clarity and proportion\" of his works.<ref name=\"Nikitina2009\" />\n\nMore generally, Weinberg's style can be described as [[Contemporary classical music|modern]] yet accessible. His [[Harmony|harmonic language]] is usually based on an expanded/free [[tonality]] mixed with occasional [[polytonality]] (e.g. as in the Twentieth Symphony) and [[atonality]] (e.g. as in the Twelfth String Quartet or the 24 Preludes for Solo Cello). His earlier works exhibit neo-[[Romantic music|Romantic]] tendencies and draw significantly on folk-music, whereas his later works, which came with improved social circumstances and greater compositional maturity, are more complex and austere. However, even in these later, more experimental works from the late 1960s, 70s and 80s (e.g. the Third Violin Sonata or the Tenth Symphony), which make liberal use of [[tone clusters]] and other devices, Weinberg retains a keen sense of tradition that variously manifests itself in the use of classical [[Musical form|forms]], more restrained tonality, or lyrical melodic lines. Always masterfully crafted, many of his instrumental works contain highly virtosic writing and make significant technical demands on performers.\n\n===Shostakovich and stylistic influences===\n\nAlthough he never formally studied with Shostakovich, the older composer had an obvious influence on Weinberg's music. This is particularly noticeable in his Twelfth Symphony (1975\u20131976, Op. 114), which is dedicated to the memory of Shostakovich and quotes from a number of the latter's works. Other explicit connections include the pianissimo passage with [[celesta]] which ends the Fifth Symphony (1962, Op. 76), reminiscent of Shostakovich's [[Symphony No. 4 (Shostakovich)|Fourth]]; the quote from one of Shostakovich's [[24 Preludes and Fugues (Shostakovich)|Preludes and Fugues]] in Weinberg's Sixth Piano Sonata (1960, Op. 73); and numerous, strung-together quotes from Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto and Cello Sonata (4th movement) in Weinberg's 21st Prelude for Solo Cello. These explicit connections should not be interpreted, however, to mean that musical influences went in only one direction (from Shostakovich to Weinberg). Indeed, Shostakovich drew significant inspiration from Weinberg's Seventh Symphony for his [[String Quartet No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth String Quartet]]<ref name=\"Sobolev2014\">{{cite web |last1=Sobolev |first1=Oleg |title=\u041c\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0412\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433: \u0413\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439 [\"Mieczyslaw Weinberg: Glossary\"] |url=https://art1.ru/2014/05/15/mechislav-vajnberg-glossarij-37235 |website=ART-1 |accessdate=23 February 2020 |language=Russian |date=15 May 2014}}</ref>; Shostakovich also drew on some of the ideas in Weinberg's Ninth String Quartet for the slow movement of his Tenth Quartet (opening bars of Weinberg's Ninth), for his [[String Quartet No. 11 (Shostakovich)|Eleventh Quartet]] (first movement of Weinberg's Ninth) and for his [[String Quartet No. 12 (Shostakovich)|Twelfth Quartet]] (F-sharp major ending)<ref>Fanning, David (2010), Notes to String Quartets Vol. 4, CPO CD 777 394-2, p. 15.</ref>; and in his [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|First Cello Concerto]] of 1959, Shostakovich re-used Weinberg's idea of a solo cello motif in the first movement that recurs at the end of the work to impart unity, from Weinberg's Cello Concerto (1948, Op. 43).<ref>Fanning, David (2012), Notes to Cello Concerto and Symphony 20, Chandos CD CHSA 5107, pp. 5 - 6.</ref>\n\nIt is also important to note that Weinberg does not restrict himself to quoting Shostakovich. For example, Weinberg's Trumpet Concerto quotes [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s well-known [[Wedding March]]; his Second Piano Sonata (written in 1942, before moving to Moscow) quotes Haydn; and his Twenty First Symphony quotes a Chopin ballade. Such cryptic quotations are stylistic features shared by both Weinberg and Shostakovich.\n\nThe discussion above highlights that mutual influences and stylistic affinities can be found in many works by the two composers, no doubt as a result of their close friendship and similar compositional views (see also <ref>Elphick, Daniel (2019), \"Music Behind the Iron Curtain: Weinberg and his Polish Contemporaries\", Cambridge University Press.</ref>).\n\nMore general similarities in musical language between Shostakovich and Weinberg include the use of extended melodies, repetitive themes, and methods of developing the musical material.<ref name=\"Nikitina1994\">Nikitina, Lyudmilla (1994), \"\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0433 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u2014 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u2026\" [\"Almost every moment of my life is work\"], \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u044f [Journal of the Academy of Music] No. 5, pp. 17-24. </ref> However, as Nikitina states, \"already in the 60s it was obvious that Weinberg's style was individual and essentially different from the style of Shostakovich.\"<ref name=\"Nikitina1994\" />.\n\nAlong with Shostakovich, Nikitina identifies Prokofiev, [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] as formative influences.<ref name=\"Nikitina2009\" /> Ethnic influences include not only [[Jewish music]], but also Moldavian, Polish, Uzbek, and Armenian elements.

In [[#Normalized notation|normalized notation]], the exponent is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] (modulus) of the significand ''m'' is at least 1 but less than 10.\n\n[[Decimal floating point]] is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.\n\n==Normalized notation==\n<!-- linked to -->\n{{main|Normalized number}}\nAny given real number can be written in the form {{gaps|''m''|e=''n''}} in many ways: for example, 350 can be written as {{val|3.5e2}} or {{val|35e1}} or {{val|350e0}}.<!-- \"any given number\" includes irrational numbers, which can't -->\n\nIn ''normalized'' scientific notation (called \"standard form\" in the UK), the exponent ''n'' is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' remains at least one but less than ten ({{nowrap begin}}1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10{{nowrap end}}). Thus 350 is written as {{val|3.5e2}}. This form allows easy comparison of numbers, as the exponent ''n'' gives the number's [[order of magnitude]]. It is the form that is required when using tables of [[common logarithm]]s. In normalized notation, the exponent ''n'' is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 is written as {{val|5e-1}}). The 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0.\n\nNormalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields, unless an unnormalized form, such as [[engineering notation]], is desired. Normalized scientific notation is often called '''[[exponentiation|exponential]] notation'''\u2014although the latter term is more general and also applies when ''m'' is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 (as in engineering notation for instance) and to [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s other than 10 (for example, {{gaps|3.15|base=2|e=20}}).\n\n==Engineering notation==\n{{Main|Engineering notation}}\nEngineering notation (often named \"ENG\" display mode on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent ''n'' is restricted to [[multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of ''m'' is in the range 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 1000, rather than 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding [[SI prefixes]], which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, {{val|12.5e-9|u=m}} can be read as \"twelve-point-five nanometres\" and written as {{val|12.5|u=nm}}, while its scientific notation equivalent {{val|1.25e-8|u=m}} would likely be read out as \"one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight metres\".\n\n==Significant figures==\n{{Main|Significant figures}}\nA significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision. This includes all nonzero numbers, zeroes between significant digits, and zeroes [[Significant figures#Identifying significant digits|indicated to be significant]].\nLeading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number. Therefore, {{val|1230400}} usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number.\n\nWhen a number is converted into normalized scientific notation, it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10. All of the significant digits remain, but the place holding zeroes are no longer required. Thus {{val|1230400}} would become {{val|1.2304e6}}. However, there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures, in which case the number would be shown as (for instance) {{val|1.23040e6}}. Thus, an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer.\n\n===Estimated final digit(s)===\nIt is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).\n\nAdditional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations. It is often useful to know how exact the final digit(s) are.

Because [[subscript and superscript|superscripted]] exponents like 10<sup>7</sup> cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter ''E'' (or ''e'') is often used to represent \"times ten raised to the power of\" (which would be written as {{nowrap|\"\u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>\"}}) and is followed by the value of the exponent; in other words, for any two real numbers ''m'' and ''n'', the usage of \"''m''E''n''\" would indicate a value of ''m'' \u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>. In this usage the character ''e'' is not related to the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']] or the [[exponential function]] ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> (a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital ''E''). Although the ''E'' stands for ''exponent'', the notation is usually referred to as ''(scientific) E notation'' rather than ''(scientific) exponential notation''. The use of E notation facilitates data entry and readability in textual communication since it minimizes keystrokes, avoids reduced font sizes and provides a simpler and more concise display, but it is not encouraged in some publications.<ref>{{Citation |author-last=Edwards |author-first=John |date=2009 |title=Submission Guidelines for Authors: HPS 2010 Midyear Proceedings |publisher=Health Physics Society |location=[[McLean, Virginia]] |page=5 |url=http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2013-03-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112227/http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Decapower|D notation}}Examples and other notations ===\n* In most popular programming languages, {{code|6.022E23}} (or {{code|6.022e23}}) is equivalent to [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022e23}}]], and [[Planck length|{{val|1.6e-35}}]] would be written {{code|1.6E-35}} (e.g. [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Analytica (software)|Analytica]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], [[FORTRAN]] (since [[FORTRAN II]] as of 1958), [[MATLAB]], [[Scilab]], [[Perl]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html |title=Primitive Data Types (The Java Tutorials > Learning the Java Language > Language Basics) |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |access-date=2012-03-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117041930/http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html |archive-date=2011-11-17}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[JavaScript]], and others).\n* After the introduction of the first [[pocket calculator]]s supporting scientific notation in 1972 ([[HP-35]], [[TI SR-10|SR-10]]) the term ''decapower'' was sometimes used in the emerging user communities for the power-of-ten multiplier in order to better distinguish it from \"normal\" exponents.

I'm going to begin using it in place of \"[[exponent]]\" which is technically incorrect, and the letter D to separate the \"[[Mantissa (floating point number)|mantissa]]\" from the decapower for typewritten numbers, as Jim also suggests. For example, {{sic|<code>123|<sup>\u221245</sup></code>|expected=<code>123\u00d710<sup>\u221245</sup></code>}} which is displayed in scientific notation as <code>1.23 -43</code> will now be written <code>1.23D-43</code>. Perhaps, as this notation gets more and more usage, the calculator manufacturers will change their keyboard abbreviations.

A [[proton]]'s mass is {{val|0.0000000000000000000000000016726|u=kg}}. If written as {{val|1.6726e-27|u=kg}}, it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below.  The [[order of magnitude]] of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more [[error-prone]] task of counting the leading zeros.  In this case, \u221227 is larger than \u221231 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ({{val|10000|fmt=commas}} times) more massive than the electron.\n\nScientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers, such as ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'', which might indicate either 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>12</sup>.\n\nIn physics and astrophysics, the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as \"dex\", a contraction of \"decimal exponent\" (see f.e. [[Metallicity#Chemical abundance ratios|Chemical abundance ratios]]). For instance, if two numbers are within {{val|1|u=dex}} of each other, then the ratio of the larger to the smaller number is less than 10.

The number {{val|-0.0040321}} would have its decimal separator shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield {{val|-4.0321e-3}} as a result.\n\n===Scientific to decimal===\nConverting a number from scientific notation to decimal notation, first remove the <code class=nowrap>\u00d7 10''<sup>n</sup>''</code> on the end, then shift the decimal separator ''n'' digits to the right (positive ''n'') or left (negative ''n''). The number {{val|1.2304e6}} would have its decimal separator shifted 6 digits to the right and become {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}}, while {{val|-4.0321e-3}} would have its decimal separator moved 3 digits to the left and be {{val|-0.0040321}}.\n\n=== Exponential===\nConversion between different scientific notation representations of the same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part. The decimal separator in the significand is shifted ''x'' places to the left (or right) and ''x'' is added to (or subtracted from) the exponent, as shown below.\n\n: {{val|1.234e3}} = {{val|12.34e2}} = {{val|123.4e1}} = 1234\n\n==Basic operations==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Addition]] -->\nGiven two numbers in scientific notation,\n\n:<math>x_0=m_0\\times10^{n_0}</math>\nand\n:<math>x_1=m_1\\times10^{n_1}</math>\n\n[[Multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are performed using the rules for operation with [[exponentiation]]:\n\n:<math>x_0 x_1=m_0 m_1\\times10^{n_0+n_1}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{x_0}{x_1}=\\frac{m_0}{m_1}\\times10^{n_0-n_1}</math>\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>5.67\\times10^{-5} \\times 2.34\\times10^2 \\approx 13.3\\times10^{-5+2} = 13.3\\times10^{-3} = 1.33\\times10^{-2}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{2.34\\times10^2}{5.67\\times10^{-5}}  \\approx 0.413\\times10^{2-(-5)} = 0.413\\times10^{7} = 4.13\\times10^6</math>\n\n[[Addition]] and [[subtraction]] require the numbers to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the significand can be simply added or subtracted:\n\n:<math>x_0 = m_0 \\times10^{n_0}</math> and <math>x_1 = m_1 \\times10^{n_1}</math> with <math>n_0 = n_1</math>\n\nNext, add or subtract the significands:\n\n:<math>x_0 \\pm x_1=(m_0\\pm m_1)\\times10^{n_0}</math>\n\nAn example:\n\n:<math>2.34\\times10^{-5} + 5.67\\times10^{-6} = 2.34\\times10^{-5} + 0.567\\times10^{-5} = 2.907\\times10^{-5}</math>\n\n=={{anchor|B notation|P notation}}Other bases==\nWhile base ten is normally used for scientific notation, powers of other bases can be used too,<ref name=\"TI_1974_SR-22\">{{cite book |title=electronic hexadecimal calculator/converter SR-22 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments Incorporated]] |date=1974 |page=7 |edition=Revision A |id=1304-389 Rev A |url=http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |access-date=2017-03-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320001329/http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-20}} (NB.

In [[#Normalized notation|normalized notation]], the exponent is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] (modulus) of the significand ''m'' is at least 1 but less than 10.\n\n[[Decimal floating point]] is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.\n\n==Normalized notation==\n<!-- linked to -->\n{{main|Normalized number}}\nAny given real number can be written in the form {{gaps|''m''|e=''n''}} in many ways: for example, 350 can be written as {{val|3.5e2}} or {{val|35e1}} or {{val|350e0}}.<!-- \"any given number\" includes irrational numbers, which can't -->\n\nIn ''normalized'' scientific notation (called \"standard form\" in the UK), the exponent ''n'' is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' remains at least one but less than ten ({{nowrap begin}}1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10{{nowrap end}}). Thus 350 is written as {{val|3.5e2}}. This form allows easy comparison of numbers, as the exponent ''n'' gives the number's [[order of magnitude]]. It is the form that is required when using tables of [[common logarithm]]s. In normalized notation, the exponent ''n'' is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 is written as {{val|5e-1}}). The 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0.\n\nNormalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields, unless an unnormalized form, such as [[engineering notation]], is desired. Normalized scientific notation is often called '''[[exponentiation|exponential]] notation'''\u2014although the latter term is more general and also applies when ''m'' is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 (as in engineering notation for instance) and to [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s other than 10 (for example, {{gaps|3.15|base=2|e=20}}).\n\n==Engineering notation==\n{{Main|Engineering notation}}\nEngineering notation (often named \"ENG\" display mode on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent ''n'' is restricted to [[multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of ''m'' is in the range 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 1000, rather than 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding [[SI prefixes]], which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, {{val|12.5e-9|u=m}} can be read as \"twelve-point-five nanometres\" and written as {{val|12.5|u=nm}}, while its scientific notation equivalent {{val|1.25e-8|u=m}} would likely be read out as \"one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight metres\".\n\n==Significant figures==\n{{Main|Significant figures}}\nA significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision. This includes all nonzero numbers, zeroes between significant digits, and zeroes [[Significant figures#Identifying significant digits|indicated to be significant]].\nLeading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number. Therefore, {{val|1230400}} usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number.\n\nWhen a number is converted into normalized scientific notation, it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10. All of the significant digits remain, but the place holding zeroes are no longer required. Thus {{val|1230400}} would become {{val|1.2304e6}}. However, there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures, in which case the number would be shown as (for instance) {{val|1.23040e6}}. Thus, an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer.\n\n===Estimated final digit(s)===\nIt is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).\n\nAdditional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations. It is often useful to know how exact the final digit(s) are. For instance, the accepted value of the unit of elementary charge can properly be expressed as {{val|1.6021766208e-19|(98)|ul=C}},<ref name=\"CUU_2014_e\">{{cite web |title=CODATA Value: Elementary charge ''e'' |work=[[CODATA 2014]]: The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty: Fundamental Physical Constants |publisher=[[NIST]] |date=2014-06-25 |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |access-date=2017-06-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625091532/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |archive-date=2017-06-25}}</ref> which is shorthand for {{val|1.6021766208e-19|0.0000000098|u=C}}.\n\n==E notation==\n<!-- section title used as link target -->\n[[Image:Avogadro's number in e notation.jpg|thumb|upright|A calculator display showing the [[Avogadro constant]] in E notation]]\n\nMost [[calculator]]s and many [[computer program]]s present very large and very small results in scientific notation, typically invoked by a key labelled {{button|EXP}} (for ''exponent''), {{button|EEX}} (for ''enter exponent''), {{button|EE}}, {{button|EX}}, {{button|E}}, or {{button|\u00d710<sup>''x''</sup>}} depending on vendor and model. Because [[subscript and superscript|superscripted]] exponents like 10<sup>7</sup> cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter ''E'' (or ''e'') is often used to represent \"times ten raised to the power of\" (which would be written as {{nowrap|\"\u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>\"}}) and is followed by the value of the exponent; in other words, for any two real numbers ''m'' and ''n'', the usage of \"''m''E''n''\" would indicate a value of ''m'' \u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>. In this usage the character ''e'' is not related to the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']] or the [[exponential function]] ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> (a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital ''E''). Although the ''E'' stands for ''exponent'', the notation is usually referred to as ''(scientific) E notation'' rather than ''(scientific) exponential notation''. The use of E notation facilitates data entry and readability in textual communication since it minimizes keystrokes, avoids reduced font sizes and provides a simpler and more concise display, but it is not encouraged in some publications.<ref>{{Citation |author-last=Edwards |author-first=John |date=2009 |title=Submission Guidelines for Authors: HPS 2010 Midyear Proceedings |publisher=Health Physics Society |location=[[McLean, Virginia]] |page=5 |url=http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2013-03-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112227/http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Decapower|D notation}}Examples and other notations ===\n* In most popular programming languages, {{code|6.022E23}} (or {{code|6.022e23}}) is equivalent to [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022e23}}]], and [[Planck length|{{val|1.6e-35}}]] would be written {{code|1.6E-35}} (e.g. [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Analytica (software)|Analytica]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], [[FORTRAN]] (since [[FORTRAN II]] as of 1958), [[MATLAB]], [[Scilab]], [[Perl]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html |title=Primitive Data Types (The Java Tutorials > Learning the Java Language > Language Basics) |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |access-date=2012-03-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117041930/http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html |archive-date=2011-11-17}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[JavaScript]], and others).\n* After the introduction of the first [[pocket calculator]]s supporting scientific notation in 1972 ([[HP-35]], [[TI SR-10|SR-10]]) the term ''decapower'' was sometimes used in the emerging user communities for the power-of-ten multiplier in order to better distinguish it from \"normal\" exponents.

I'm going to begin using it in place of \"[[exponent]]\" which is technically incorrect, and the letter D to separate the \"[[Mantissa (floating point number)|mantissa]]\" from the decapower for typewritten numbers, as Jim also suggests. For example, {{sic|<code>123|<sup>\u221245</sup></code>|expected=<code>123\u00d710<sup>\u221245</sup></code>}} which is displayed in scientific notation as <code>1.23 -43</code> will now be written <code>1.23D-43</code>.

A [[proton]]'s mass is {{val|0.0000000000000000000000000016726|u=kg}}. If written as {{val|1.6726e-27|u=kg}}, it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below.  The [[order of magnitude]] of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more [[error-prone]] task of counting the leading zeros.  In this case, \u221227 is larger than \u221231 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ({{val|10000|fmt=commas}} times) more massive than the electron.\n\nScientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers, such as ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'', which might indicate either 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>12</sup>.\n\nIn physics and astrophysics, the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as \"dex\", a contraction of \"decimal exponent\" (see f.e.

In engineering notation, this is written {{val|40e6|u=m}}.

Quoting a value of {{val|25.400|u=mm}} shows that the value is correct to the nearest micrometre. An approximated value with only two significant digits would be {{val|2.5e1|u=mm}} instead. As there is no limit to the number of significant digits, the length of an inch could, if required, be written as (say) {{val|2.54000000000e1|u=mm}} instead.\n\n==Converting numbers==\nConverting a number in these cases means to either convert the number into scientific notation form, convert it back into decimal form or to change the exponent part of the equation. None of these alter the actual number, only how it's expressed.\n\n===Decimal to scientific===\nFirst, move the decimal separator point sufficient places, ''n'', to put the number's value within a desired range, between 1 and 10 for normalized notation. If the decimal was moved to the left, append <code class=nowarp>\u00d7 10''<sup>n</sup>''</code>; to the right, <code class=nowarp>\u00d7 10''<sup>\u2212n</sup>''</code>. To represent the number {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}} in normalized scientific notation, the decimal separator would be moved 6 digits to the left and <code class=nowrap>\u00d7 10<sup>6</sup></code> appended, resulting in {{val|1.2304e6}}. The number {{val|-0.0040321}} would have its decimal separator shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield {{val|-4.0321e-3}} as a result.\n\n===Scientific to decimal===\nConverting a number from scientific notation to decimal notation, first remove the <code class=nowrap>\u00d7 10''<sup>n</sup>''</code> on the end, then shift the decimal separator ''n'' digits to the right (positive ''n'') or left (negative ''n''). The number {{val|1.2304e6}} would have its decimal separator shifted 6 digits to the right and become {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}}, while {{val|-4.0321e-3}} would have its decimal separator moved 3 digits to the left and be {{val|-0.0040321}}.\n\n=== Exponential===\nConversion between different scientific notation representations of the same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part. The decimal separator in the significand is shifted ''x'' places to the left (or right) and ''x'' is added to (or subtracted from) the exponent, as shown below.\n\n: {{val|1.234e3}} = {{val|12.34e2}} = {{val|123.4e1}} = 1234\n\n==Basic operations==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Addition]] -->\nGiven two numbers in scientific notation,\n\n:<math>x_0=m_0\\times10^{n_0}</math>\nand\n:<math>x_1=m_1\\times10^{n_1}</math>\n\n[[Multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are performed using the rules for operation with [[exponentiation]]:\n\n:<math>x_0 x_1=m_0 m_1\\times10^{n_0+n_1}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{x_0}{x_1}=\\frac{m_0}{m_1}\\times10^{n_0-n_1}</math>\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>5.67\\times10^{-5} \\times 2.34\\times10^2 \\approx 13.3\\times10^{-5+2} = 13.3\\times10^{-3} = 1.33\\times10^{-2}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{2.34\\times10^2}{5.67\\times10^{-5}}  \\approx 0.413\\times10^{2-(-5)} = 0.413\\times10^{7} = 4.13\\times10^6</math>\n\n[[Addition]] and [[subtraction]] require the numbers to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the significand can be simply added or subtracted:\n\n:<math>x_0 = m_0 \\times10^{n_0}</math> and <math>x_1 = m_1 \\times10^{n_1}</math> with <math>n_0 = n_1</math>\n\nNext, add or subtract the significands:\n\n:<math>x_0 \\pm x_1=(m_0\\pm m_1)\\times10^{n_0}</math>\n\nAn example:\n\n:<math>2.34\\times10^{-5} + 5.67\\times10^{-6} = 2.34\\times10^{-5} + 0.567\\times10^{-5} = 2.907\\times10^{-5}</math>\n\n=={{anchor|B notation|P notation}}Other bases==\nWhile base ten is normally used for scientific notation, powers of other bases can be used too,<ref name=\"TI_1974_SR-22\">{{cite book |title=electronic hexadecimal calculator/converter SR-22 |publisher=[[Texas Instruments Incorporated]] |date=1974 |page=7 |edition=Revision A |id=1304-389 Rev A |url=http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |access-date=2017-03-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320001329/http://www.datamath.net/Manuals/SR-22_US.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-20}} (NB.

She has something to say with her performances, whether in a music video for Sia or in a solo at nationals. Her technique is lovely, especially for a 12-year-old. She has stretched knees, pointed feet, and arms that float on clouds, her fingers perfectly placed. But still more important is her virtuosity, her connection with the public. She tells a narrative that resonates with the viewer, whether portraying a scorned lover or a werewolf. This maturity is astounding for a preteen \u2013 she just gets it.

The group espouses a philosophy known as \"Chaosophy\". Chaosophy asserts that the world that we live in, and the universe that it lives in, all exists within the realm known as Cosmos. Cosmos is made of three spatial dimensions and one linear time dimension. Cosmos rarely ever changes and is a materialistic realm. Another realm that exists is known as Chaos. Chaos exists outside of the Cosmos and is made of infinite dimensions and unlike the Cosmos, it is always changing. Members of the TotBL believe that the realm of Chaos is ruled over by 11 dark gods, the highest of them being Satan, and all of said gods are considered manifestations of a higher being. This higher being is known as Azerate, the Dragon Mother, and is all of the 11 gods united as one.

The type of Satanism described in ''L\u00e0-bas'' suggests that prayers are said to the [[Devil]], hosts are stolen from the Catholic Church, and sexual acts are combined with [[Roman Catholic]] altar objects and rituals, to produce a variety of Satanism which exalts the Devil and degrades the God of Christianity by inverting Roman Catholic rites. [[George Bataille]] claims that Huysman's description of the Black Mass is \"indisputably authentic\".<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Not all theistic Satanists today routinely perform the Black Mass, possibly because the Mass is not a part of modern evangelical Christianity in Protestant countries<ref>{{cite book |last=Christiano | first=Kevin |author2=William H.

The Ophite Cultus Satanas was inspired by the ancient [[Ophites|Ophite]] sect of [[Gnosticism]], and the Horned God of [[Wicca]]. The group was dependent upon its founder and leader, and therefore dissolved after his death in 1975.\n\nMichael Aquino published a rare 1970 text of a Church of Satan Black Mass, the ''Missa Solemnis'', in his book ''The Church of Satan'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Aquino |first=Michael |title = The Church of Satan |year=2002}}, Appendix 7.</ref> and [[Anton LaVey]] included a different Church of Satan Black Mass, the ''Messe Noire'', in his 1972 book ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]''. LaVey's books on Satanism, which began in the 1960s, were for a long time the few available which advertised themselves as being Satanic, although others detailed the history of witchcraft and Satanism, such as ''The Black Arts'' by [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]] published in 1967 and the classic French work ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft]]'', by [[Jules Michelet]]. Anton LaVey specifically denounced \"devil worshippers\" and the idea of praying to Satan.\n\nAlthough non-theistic LaVey Satanism had been popular since the publication of ''The Satanic Bible'' in 1969, theistic Satanism did not start to gain any popularity until the emergence of the [[Order of Nine Angles]] in western England, and its publication of ''The Black Book of Satan'' in 1984.<ref>''The Black Book of Satan''. 1984, Thormynd Press, {{ISBN|0-946646-04-X}}.

In the United States, the Kern County child abuse cases, [[McMartin preschool trial]] and the West Memphis cases were widely reported. One case took place in Jordan, Minnesota, in which children made allegations of the manufacture of [[child pornography]], ritualistic [[animal sacrifice]], [[coprophagia]], [[urophagia]] and [[infanticide]], at which point the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) was alerted. Twenty-four adults were arrested and charged with acts of sexual abuse, child pornography and other crimes claimed to be related to Satanic ritual abuse; three went to trial, two were acquitted and one convicted. Supreme Court Justice Scalia noted in a discussion of the case that \"[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged\", and cited the repeated, coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.<ref>''Maryland v. Craig'', 497 U.S. 836 (1990)</ref>\n\nThese iconic cases were launched after children were repeatedly and coercively interrogated by [[social work]]ers, resulting in [[False allegation of child sexual abuse|false allegations of child sexual abuse]].

Anton LaVey specifically denounced \"devil worshippers\" and the idea of praying to Satan.\n\nAlthough non-theistic LaVey Satanism had been popular since the publication of ''The Satanic Bible'' in 1969, theistic Satanism did not start to gain any popularity until the emergence of the [[Order of Nine Angles]] in western England, and its publication of ''The Black Book of Satan'' in 1984.<ref>''The Black Book of Satan''. 1984, Thormynd Press, {{ISBN|0-946646-04-X}}.

Following the assassination of Hipparchus in about 514, Hippias took on sole rule, and in response to the loss of his brother, became a worse leader who was increasingly disliked. Hippias exiled 700 of the Athenian noble families, amongst them [[Cleisthenes]]' family, the Alchmaeonids. Upon their exile, they went to Delphi, and Herodotus<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Histories|last=Translated Robin Waterfield|first=Herodotus|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> says they bribed the [[Pythia]] always to tell visiting Spartans that they should invade Attica and overthrow Hippias. That supposedly worked after a number of times, and Cleomenes led a Spartan force to overthrow Hippias, which succeeded, and instated an oligarchy. Cleisthenes disliked the Spartan rule, along with many other Athenians, and so made his own bid for power. The result was [[democracy in Athens]], but considering Cleisthenes' motivation for using the people to gain power, as without their support, he would have been defeated,and so Athenian democracy may be tainted by the fact its creation served greatly the man who created it. The reforms of Cleisthenes replaced the traditional four Ionic \"tribes\" ([[phyle]]) with ten new ones, named after legendary heroes of Greece and having no class basis, which acted as electorates. Each tribe was in turn divided into three trittyes (one from the coast; one from the city and one from the inland divisions), while each [[trittys]] had one or more [[deme]]s, depending on their population, which became the basis of local government. The tribes each selected fifty members by lot for the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]], the council that governed Athens on a day-to-day basis. The [[public opinion]] of voters could be influenced by the [[political satire]]s written by the [[comic poets]] and performed in the city [[Theater of ancient Greece|theaters]].<ref>Henderson, J.

Most offices were filled by lot, although the ten [[strategos|strategoi]] (generals) were elected.\n\n[[File:EarlyAthenianCoin.jpg|thumb|left|Early [[Athenian]] coin, 5th century BC. [[British Museum]].]]\n\nThe silver [[mines of Laurion]] contributed significantly to the development of Athens in the 5th century BC, when the Athenians learned to prospect, treat, and refine the ore and used the proceeds to build a massive fleet, at the instigation of [[Themistocles]].<ref>https://www.ancient-greece.org/archaeology/lavrion.html</ref>\n\nIn 499 BC, Athens sent troops to aid the [[Ionia]]n Greeks of [[Asia Minor]], who were rebelling against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (see [[Ionian Revolt]]). That provoked two Persian invasions of Greece, both of which were repelled under the leadership of the soldier-statesmen [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] and [[Themistocles]] (see [[Persian Wars]]). In 490 the Athenians, led by [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]], prevented the first invasion of the Persians, guided by king [[Darius I]], at the [[Battle of Marathon]]. In 480 the Persians returned under a new ruler, [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]]. The Hellenic League led by the Spartan King [[Leonidas]] led 7,000 men to hold the narrow passageway of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] against the 100,000\u2013250,000 army of Xerxes, during which Leonidas and 300 other Spartan elites were killed. Simultaneously the Athenians led an indecisive naval battle off [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]]. However, that delaying action was not enough to discourage the Persian advance,  which soon marched through [[Boeotia]], setting up [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] as their base of operations, and entered southern Greece. That forced the Athenians to evacuate Athens, which was taken by the Persians, and seek the protection of their fleet. Subsequently, the Athenians and their allies, led by [[Themistocles]], defeated the Persian navy at sea in the [[Battle of Salamis]]. Xerxes had built himself a throne on the coast in order to see the Greeks defeated. Instead, the Persians were routed. Sparta's hegemony was passing to Athens, and it was Athens that took the war to Asia Minor. The victories enabled it to bring most of the Aegean and many other parts of Greece together in the [[Delian League]], an Athenian-dominated alliance.\n\n===Athenian hegemony (448\u2013430 BC)===\n\n{{main|Age of Pericles}}\n[[Pericles]] \u2013 an Athenian general, politician and orator \u2013 distinguished himself above the other personalities of the era, men who excelled in [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[history]] and [[literature]]. He fostered arts and literature and gave to Athens a splendor which would never return throughout its history. He executed a large number of public works projects and improved the life of the citizens. Hence, he gave his name to the '''Athenian Golden Age'''. Silver mined in [[Laurium]] in southeastern Attica contributed greatly to the prosperity of this \"Golden\" Age of Athens.\n\nDuring the time of the ascendancy of [[Ephialtes]] as leader of the democratic faction, [[Pericles]] was his deputy. When Ephialtes was [[assassination|assassinated]] by personal enemies, Pericles stepped in and was elected general, or ''[[strategos]]'', in 445 BC; a post he held continuously until his death in 429 BC, always by election of the [[Athenian Assembly]]. The [[Parthenon]], a lavishly decorated temple to the goddess [[Athena]], was constructed under the administration of Pericles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Athens|last=Camp|first=John|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC)===\n\n{{main|Peloponnesian War}}\n{{further|Athenian coup of 411 BC}}\n[[File:Ac.academy.jpeg|thumb|The modern [[Academy of Athens (modern)|National Academy]] in Athens, with Apollo and Athena on their columns, and Socrates and Plato seated in front.]]\nResentment by other cities at the hegemony of Athens led to the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431, which pitted Athens and her increasingly rebellious sea empire against a coalition of land-based states led by [[Sparta]]. The conflict marked the end of Athenian [[command of the sea]]. The war between Athens and the city-state Sparta ended with an Athenian defeat after Sparta started its own navy.\n\nAthenian democracy was briefly overthrown by the [[Athenian coup of 411 BC|coup of 411]], brought about because of its poor handling of the war, but it was quickly restored. The war ended with the complete defeat of Athens in 404. Since the defeat was largely blamed on democratic politicians such as [[Cleon]] and [[Cleophon (politician)|Cleophon]], there was a brief reaction against democracy, aided by the Spartan army (the rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]]). In 403, [[Phyle Campaign|democracy was restored]] by [[Thrasybulus]] and an amnesty declared.\n\n===Corinthian War and the Second Athenian League (395\u2013355 BC)===\n\nSparta's former allies soon turned against her due to her imperialist policies, and Athens's former enemies, [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], became her allies. [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], allied with [[Athens]], fought against [[Sparta]] in the decisive [[Corinthian War]] of 395\u2013387 BC. Opposition to Sparta enabled Athens to establish a [[Second Athenian League]]. Finally [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] defeated Sparta in 371 in the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. However, other Greek cities, including Athens, turned against [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and its dominance was brought to an end at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)]] with the death of its leader, the military genius [[Epaminondas]].\n\n===Athens under Macedon (355\u2013322 BC)===\n{{further|Alexander the Great|Antipatrid dynasty|Antigonid dynasty}}\nBy mid century, however, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338 BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated Athens at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], effectively  limiting Athenian independence. During the winter of 338 BC /337 BC Macedonia, Athens and other Greek states became part of the [[League of Corinth]]. Further, the conquests of his son, [[Alexander the Great]], widened Greek horizons and made the traditional Greek city state obsolete. [[Antipater]] dissolved the Athenian government and established a [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] system in 322 BC (see [[Lamian War]] and [[Demetrius Phalereus]]).  Athens remained a wealthy city with a brilliant cultural life, but ceased to be an independent power.\n\n==The City of Athens==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Map ancient athens.png|thumb|250px|Map of ancient Athens showing the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in middle, the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] to the northwest, and the city walls.]]\nAthens was in [[Attica]], about 30 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] from the sea, on the southwest slope of [[Mount Lycabettus]], between the small rivers [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]] to the west, [[Ilissos]] to the south, and the [[Eridanos (Athens)|Eridanos]] to the north, the latter of which flowed through the town. The walled city measured about {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, although at its peak the city had suburbs extending well beyond these walls. The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] was just south of the centre of this walled area. The city was burnt by [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 BC, but was soon rebuilt under the administration of [[Themistocles]], and was adorned with public buildings by [[Cimon]] and especially by [[Pericles]], in whose time (461\u2013429 BC) it reached its greatest splendour. Its beauty was chiefly due to its public buildings, for the private houses were mostly insignificant, and its streets badly laid out. Towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]], it contained more than 10,000 houses,<ref>Xenophon, ''Mem.'' iii. 6.14</ref> which at a rate of 12 inhabitants to a house would give a population of 120,000, though some writers make the inhabitants as many as 180,000. Athens consisted of two distinct parts:\n* ''The City'', properly so called, divided into The Upper City or [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], and The Lower City, surrounded with walls by Themistocles.\n* The port city of [[Piraeus]], also surrounded with walls by Themistocles and connected to the city with the [[Long Walls]], built under [[Conon]] and [[Pericles]].\n\n===The City Walls===\n{{main|City walls of Athens}}\n{{main|Long Walls}}\n[[File:AtheneOudheid.JPG|thumb|250px|Map of the environs of Athens showing [[Piraeus]], [[Phalerum]], and the [[Long Walls]]]]\nThe city was surrounded by defensive walls from the Bronze Age and they were rebuilt and extended over the centuries.\n\nIn addition the [[Long Walls]] consisted of two parallel walls leading to [[Piraeus]], 40 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] long (4.5 miles, 7&nbsp;km), running parallel to each other, with a narrow passage between them and, furthermore, a wall to [[Phalerum]] on the east, 35 stadia long (4 miles, 6.5&nbsp;km). There were therefore three long walls in all; but the name ''Long Walls'' seems to have been confined to the two leading to the Piraeus, while the one leading to Phalerum was called the ''Phalerian Wall''. The entire circuit of the walls was 174.5 stadia (nearly 22 miles, 35&nbsp;km), of which 43 stadia (5.5 miles, 9&nbsp;km) belonged to the city, 75 stadia (9.5 miles, 15&nbsp;km) to the long walls, and 56.5 stadia (7 miles, 11&nbsp;km) to Piraeus, Munichia, and Phalerum.\n\n===The Acropolis (upper city)===\nThe [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], also called ''Cecropia'' from its reputed founder, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], was a steep rock in the middle of the city, about 50 meters high, 350 meters long, and 150 meters wide; its sides were naturally scarped on all sides except the west end. It was originally surrounded by an ancient [[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean]] wall said to have been built by the [[Pelasgians]]. At the time of the [[Peloponnesian war]] only the north part of this wall remained, and this portion was still called the ''Pelasgic Wall''; while the south part which had been rebuilt by [[Cimon]], was called the ''Cimonian Wall''. On the west end of the Acropolis, where access is alone practicable, were the magnificent ''[[Propylaea]]'', \"the Entrances,\" built by [[Pericles]], before the right wing of which was the small [[Temple of Athena Nike]]. The summit of the Acropolis was covered with temples, statues of bronze and marble, and various other works of art. Of the temples, the grandest was the ''[[Parthenon]]'', sacred to the \"Virgin\" goddess [[Athena]]; and north of the Parthenon was the magnificent ''[[Erechtheion]]'', containing three separate temples, one to ''Athena Polias'', or the \"Protectress of the State,\" the ''Erechtheion'' proper, or sanctuary of [[Erechtheus]], and the ''[[Pandroseion]]'', or sanctuary of [[Pandrosos]], the daughter of Cecrops. Between the Parthenon and Erechtheion was the colossal [[Athena Promachos|Statue of Athena Promachos]], or the \"Fighter in the Front,\" whose helmet and spear was the first object on the Acropolis visible from the sea.\n\n[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] imagined in an 1846 painting by [[Leo von Klenze]]]]\n\n===The Agora (lower city)===\nThe lower city was built in the plain around the Acropolis, but this plain also contained several hills, especially in the southwest part. On the west side the walls embraced the Hill of the Nymphs and the [[Pnyx]], and to the southeast they ran along beside the [[Ilissos]].\n\n===Gates===\nThere were many gates, among the more important there were:\n* On the West side: ''Dipylon'', the most frequented gate of the city, leading from the inner [[Kerameikos]] to the outer Kerameikos, and to the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]. ''The Sacred Gate'', where the sacred road to [[Eleusis]] began. ''The Knight's Gate'', probably between the Hill of the Nymphs and the [[Pnyx]]. ''The Piraean Gate'', between the Pnyx and the Mouseion, leading to the carriage road between the Long Walls to the Piraeus. ''The Melitian Gate'', so called because it led to the [[deme]] Melite, within the city.\n* On the South side: ''The Gate of the Dead'' in the neighbourhood of the Mouseion. ''The Itonian Gate'', near the Ilissos, where the road to [[Phalerum]] began.\n* On the East side: ''The Gate of Diochares'', leading to the [[Lyceum]]. ''The Diomean Gate'', leading to [[Cynosarges]] and the deme Diomea.\n* On the North side: ''The Acharnian Gate'', leading to the deme [[Acharnai]].\n\n===Districts===\n* The ''Inner [[Kerameikos]]'', or \"Potter's Quarter,\" in the west of the city, extending north as far as the Dipylon gate, by which it was separated from the outer Kerameikos; the Kerameikos contained the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], or \"market-place,\" the only one in the city, lying northwest of the Acropolis, and north of the [[Areopagus]].\n* The [[deme]] [[Melite (Attica)|Melite]], in the west of the city, south of the inner Kerameikos.\n* The deme [[Skambonidai]], in the northern part of the city, east of the inner Kerameikos.\n* The [[Kollytos]], in the southern part of the city, south and southwest of the Acropolis.\n* [[Coele|Koele]], a district in the southwest of the city.\n* ''Limnai'', a district east of Melite and Kollytos, between the Acropolis and the Ilissos.\n* [[Diomea (Attica)|Diomea]], a district in the east of the city, near the gate of the same name and the [[Cynosarges]].\n* ''Agrai'', a district south of Diomea.\n\n===Hills===\n* The ''[[Areopagus]]'', the \"Hill of [[Ares]],\" west of the Acropolis, which gave its name to the celebrated council that held its sittings there, was accessible on the south side by a flight of steps cut out of the rock.\n* The ''Hill of the Nymphs'', northwest of the Areopagus.\n* The ''[[Pnyx]]'', a semicircular hill, southwest of the Areopagus, where the ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ekklesia]]'' (assemblies) of the people were held in earlier times, for afterwards the people usually met in the [[Theatre of Dionysus]].\n* The ''Mouseion'', \"the Hill of the Muses,\" south of the Pnyx and the Areopagus.\n\n===Streets===\n\nAmong the more important streets, there were:\n* The ''Piraean Street'', which led from the Piraean gate to the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]].\n* The ''Panathenaic Way'', which led from the Dipylon gate to the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] via the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], along which a solemn procession was made during the [[Panathenaic Festival]].\n* The ''Street of the Tripods'', on the east side of the Acropolis.\n\n===Public buildings===\n[[File:Hephaistos Temple.JPG|thumb|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in modern-day [[Athens]]]]\n* ''Temples''. Of these the most important was the ''Olympieion'', or [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]], southeast of the Acropolis, near the Ilissos and the fountain Callirrho\u00eb, which was long unfinished, and was first completed by [[Hadrian]]. The [[Temple of Hephaestus]], located to the west of the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]]. The [[Temple of Ares]], to the north of the Agora.

The [[Theatre of Dionysus]], on the southeast slope of the Acropolis, was the great theatre of the state. Besides this there were ''[[Odeon (building)|Odeons]]'', for contests in vocal and instrumental music, an ancient one near the fountain Callirrho\u00eb, and a second built by [[Pericles]], close to the theatre of Dionysius, on the southeast slope of the Acropolis.

Some of the most important figures of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period: the dramatists [[Aeschylus]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]], the philosophers [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], and [[Socrates]], the historians [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Xenophon]], the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] and the sculptor [[Phidias]]. The leading statesman of this period was [[Pericles]], who used the tribute paid by the members of the Delian League to build the [[Parthenon]] and other great monuments of classical Athens.

Following the assassination of Hipparchus in about 514, Hippias took on sole rule, and in response to the loss of his brother, became a worse leader who was increasingly disliked. Hippias exiled 700 of the Athenian noble families, amongst them [[Cleisthenes]]' family, the Alchmaeonids. Upon their exile, they went to Delphi, and Herodotus<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Histories|last=Translated Robin Waterfield|first=Herodotus|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> says they bribed the [[Pythia]] always to tell visiting Spartans that they should invade Attica and overthrow Hippias. That supposedly worked after a number of times, and Cleomenes led a Spartan force to overthrow Hippias, which succeeded, and instated an oligarchy. Cleisthenes disliked the Spartan rule, along with many other Athenians, and so made his own bid for power. The result was [[democracy in Athens]], but considering Cleisthenes' motivation for using the people to gain power, as without their support, he would have been defeated,and so Athenian democracy may be tinted by the fact its creation served greatly the man who created it. The reforms of Cleisthenes replaced the traditional four Ionic \"tribes\" ([[phyle]]) with ten new ones, named after legendary heroes of Greece and having no class basis, which acted as electorates. Each tribe was in turn divided into three trittyes (one from the coast; one from the city and one from the inland divisions), while each [[trittys]] had one or more [[deme]]s, depending on their population, which became the basis of local government. The tribes each selected fifty members by lot for the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]], the council that governed Athens on a day-to-day basis. The [[public opinion]] of voters could be influenced by the [[political satire]]s written by the [[comic poets]] and performed in the city [[Theater of ancient Greece|theaters]].<ref>Henderson, J.

Most offices were filled by lot, although the ten [[strategos|strategoi]] (generals) were elected.\n\n[[File:EarlyAthenianCoin.jpg|thumb|left|Early [[Athenian]] coin, 5th century BC. [[British Museum]].]]\n\nThe silver [[mines of Laurion]] contributed significantly to the development of Athens in the 5th century BC, when the Athenians learned to prospect, treat, and refine the ore and used the proceeds to build a massive fleet, at the instigation of [[Themistocles]].<ref>https://www.ancient-greece.org/archaeology/lavrion.html</ref>\n\nIn 499 BC, Athens sent troops to aid the [[Ionia]]n Greeks of [[Asia Minor]], who were rebelling against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (see [[Ionian Revolt]]). That provoked two Persian invasions of Greece, both of which were repelled under the leadership of the soldier-statesmen [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] and [[Themistocles]] (see [[Persian Wars]]). In 490 the Athenians, led by [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]], prevented the first invasion of the Persians, guided by king [[Darius I]], at the [[Battle of Marathon]]. In 480 the Persians returned under a new ruler, [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]]. The Hellenic League led by the Spartan King [[Leonidas]] led 7,000 men to hold the narrow passageway of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] against the 100,000\u2013250,000 army of Xerxes, during which Leonidas and 300 other Spartan elites were killed. Simultaneously the Athenians led an indecisive naval battle off [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]]. However, that delaying action was not enough to discourage the Persian advance,  which soon marched through [[Boeotia]], setting up [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] as their base of operations, and entered southern Greece. That forced the Athenians to evacuate Athens, which was taken by the Persians, and seek the protection of their fleet. Subsequently, the Athenians and their allies, led by [[Themistocles]], defeated the Persian navy at sea in the [[Battle of Salamis]]. Xerxes had built himself a throne on the coast in order to see the Greeks defeated. Instead, the Persians were routed. Sparta's hegemony was passing to Athens, and it was Athens that took the war to Asia Minor. The victories enabled it to bring most of the Aegean and many other parts of Greece together in the [[Delian League]], an Athenian-dominated alliance.\n\n===Athenian hegemony (448\u2013430 BC)===\n\n{{main|Age of Pericles}}\n[[Pericles]] \u2013 an Athenian general, politician and orator \u2013 distinguished himself above the other personalities of the era, men who excelled in [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[history]] and [[literature]]. He fostered arts and literature and gave to Athens a splendor which would never return throughout its history. He executed a large number of public works projects and improved the life of the citizens. Hence, he gave his name to the '''Athenian Golden Age'''. Silver mined in [[Laurium]] in southeastern Attica contributed greatly to the prosperity of this \"Golden\" Age of Athens.\n\nDuring the time of the ascendancy of [[Ephialtes]] as leader of the democratic faction, [[Pericles]] was his deputy. When Ephialtes was [[assassination|assassinated]] by personal enemies, Pericles stepped in and was elected general, or ''[[strategos]]'', in 445 BC; a post he held continuously until his death in 429 BC, always by election of the [[Athenian Assembly]]. The [[Parthenon]], a lavishly decorated temple to the goddess [[Athena]], was constructed under the administration of Pericles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Athens|last=Camp|first=John|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC)===\n\n{{main|Peloponnesian War}}\n{{further|Athenian coup of 411 BC}}\n[[File:Ac.academy.jpeg|thumb|The modern [[Academy of Athens (modern)|National Academy]] in Athens, with Apollo and Athena on their columns, and Socrates and Plato seated in front.]]\nResentment by other cities at the hegemony of Athens led to the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431, which pitted Athens and her increasingly rebellious sea empire against a coalition of land-based states led by [[Sparta]]. The conflict marked the end of Athenian [[command of the sea]]. The war between Athens and the city-state Sparta ended with an Athenian defeat after Sparta started its own navy.\n\nAthenian democracy was briefly overthrown by the [[Athenian coup of 411 BC|coup of 411]], brought about because of its poor handling of the war, but it was quickly restored. The war ended with the complete defeat of Athens in 404. Since the defeat was largely blamed on democratic politicians such as [[Cleon]] and [[Cleophon (politician)|Cleophon]], there was a brief reaction against democracy, aided by the Spartan army (the rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]]). In 403, [[Phyle Campaign|democracy was restored]] by [[Thrasybulus]] and an amnesty declared.\n\n===Corinthian War and the Second Athenian League (395\u2013355 BC)===\n\nSparta's former allies soon turned against her due to her imperialist policies, and Athens's former enemies, [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], became her allies. [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], allied with [[Athens]], fought against [[Sparta]] in the decisive [[Corinthian War]] of 395\u2013387 BC. Opposition to Sparta enabled Athens to establish a [[Second Athenian League]]. Finally [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] defeated Sparta in 371 in the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. However, other Greek cities, including Athens, turned against [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and its dominance was brought to an end at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)]] with the death of its leader, the military genius [[Epaminondas]].\n\n===Athens under Macedon (355\u2013322 BC)===\n{{further|Alexander the Great|Antipatrid dynasty|Antigonid dynasty}}\nBy mid century, however, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338 BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated Athens at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], effectively  limiting Athenian independence. During the winter of 338 BC /337 BC Macedonia, Athens and other Greek states became part of the [[League of Corinth]]. Further, the conquests of his son, [[Alexander the Great]], widened Greek horizons and made the traditional Greek city state obsolete. [[Antipater]] dissolved the Athenian government and established a [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] system in 322 BC (see [[Lamian War]] and [[Demetrius Phalereus]]).  Athens remained a wealthy city with a brilliant cultural life, but ceased to be an independent power.\n\n==The City of Athens==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Map ancient athens.png|thumb|250px|Map of ancient Athens showing the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in middle, the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] to the northwest, and the city walls.]]\nAthens was in [[Attica]], about 30 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] from the sea, on the southwest slope of [[Mount Lycabettus]], between the small rivers [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]] to the west, [[Ilissos]] to the south, and the [[Eridanos (Athens)|Eridanos]] to the north, the latter of which flowed through the town. The walled city measured about {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, although at its peak the city had suburbs extending well beyond these walls. The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] was just south of the centre of this walled area. The city was burnt by [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 BC, but was soon rebuilt under the administration of [[Themistocles]], and was adorned with public buildings by [[Cimon]] and especially by [[Pericles]], in whose time (461\u2013429 BC) it reached its greatest splendour. Its beauty was chiefly due to its public buildings, for the private houses were mostly insignificant, and its streets badly laid out. Towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]], it contained more than 10,000 houses,<ref>Xenophon, ''Mem.'' iii. 6.14</ref> which at a rate of 12 inhabitants to a house would give a population of 120,000, though some writers make the inhabitants as many as 180,000. Athens consisted of two distinct parts:\n* ''The City'', properly so called, divided into The Upper City or [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], and The Lower City, surrounded with walls by Themistocles.\n* The port city of [[Piraeus]], also surrounded with walls by Themistocles and connected to the city with the [[Long Walls]], built under [[Conon]] and [[Pericles]].\n\n===The City Walls===\n{{main|City walls of Athens}}\n{{main|Long Walls}}\n[[File:AtheneOudheid.JPG|thumb|250px|Map of the environs of Athens showing [[Piraeus]], [[Phalerum]], and the [[Long Walls]]]]\nThe city was surrounded by defensive walls from the Bronze Age and they were rebuilt and extended over the centuries.\n\nIn addition the [[Long Walls]] consisted of two parallel walls leading to [[Piraeus]], 40 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] long (4.5 miles, 7&nbsp;km), running parallel to each other, with a narrow passage between them and, furthermore, a wall to [[Phalerum]] on the east, 35 stadia long (4 miles, 6.5&nbsp;km). There were therefore three long walls in all; but the name ''Long Walls'' seems to have been confined to the two leading to the Piraeus, while the one leading to Phalerum was called the ''Phalerian Wall''. The entire circuit of the walls was 174.5 stadia (nearly 22 miles, 35&nbsp;km), of which 43 stadia (5.5 miles, 9&nbsp;km) belonged to the city, 75 stadia (9.5 miles, 15&nbsp;km) to the long walls, and 56.5 stadia (7 miles, 11&nbsp;km) to Piraeus, Munichia, and Phalerum.\n\n===The Acropolis (upper city)===\nThe [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], also called ''Cecropia'' from its reputed founder, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], was a steep rock in the middle of the city, about 50 meters high, 350 meters long, and 150 meters wide; its sides were naturally scarped on all sides except the west end. It was originally surrounded by an ancient [[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean]] wall said to have been built by the [[Pelasgians]]. At the time of the [[Peloponnesian war]] only the north part of this wall remained, and this portion was still called the ''Pelasgic Wall''; while the south part which had been rebuilt by [[Cimon]], was called the ''Cimonian Wall''. On the west end of the Acropolis, where access is alone practicable, were the magnificent ''[[Propylaea]]'', \"the Entrances,\" built by [[Pericles]], before the right wing of which was the small [[Temple of Athena Nike]]. The summit of the Acropolis was covered with temples, statues of bronze and marble, and various other works of art. Of the temples, the grandest was the ''[[Parthenon]]'', sacred to the \"Virgin\" goddess [[Athena]]; and north of the Parthenon was the magnificent ''[[Erechtheion]]'', containing three separate temples, one to ''Athena Polias'', or the \"Protectress of the State,\" the ''Erechtheion'' proper, or sanctuary of [[Erechtheus]], and the ''[[Pandroseion]]'', or sanctuary of [[Pandrosos]], the daughter of Cecrops. Between the Parthenon and Erechtheion was the colossal [[Athena Promachos|Statue of Athena Promachos]], or the \"Fighter in the Front,\" whose helmet and spear was the first object on the Acropolis visible from the sea.\n\n[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|The [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] imagined in an 1846 painting by [[Leo von Klenze]]]]\n\n===The Agora (lower city)===\nThe lower city was built in the plain around the Acropolis, but this plain also contained several hills, especially in the southwest part. On the west side the walls embraced the Hill of the Nymphs and the [[Pnyx]], and to the southeast they ran along beside the [[Ilissos]].\n\n===Gates===\nThere were many gates, among the more important there were:\n* On the West side: ''Dipylon'', the most frequented gate of the city, leading from the inner [[Kerameikos]] to the outer Kerameikos, and to the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]. ''The Sacred Gate'', where the sacred road to [[Eleusis]] began. ''The Knight's Gate'', probably between the Hill of the Nymphs and the [[Pnyx]].

Some of the most important figures of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period: the dramatists [[Aeschylus]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]], the philosophers [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], and [[Socrates]], the historians [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Xenophon]], the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] and the sculptor [[Phidias]]. The leading statesman of this period was [[Pericles]], who used the tribute paid by the members of the Delian League to build the [[Parthenon]] and other great monuments of classical Athens.

She was the first woman to head a democratic government in a [[Muslim majority countries|Muslim majority]] nation. Ideologically a [[liberalism|liberal]] and a [[secularism|secularist]], she chaired or co-chaired the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) from the early 1980s until her [[Assassination of Benazir Bhutto|assassination in 2007]].\n\nOf mixed [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] parentage, Bhutto was born in [[Karachi]] to a [[Bhutto family|politically important, wealthy aristocratic family]]. Her father, the PPP's founder and leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfikar]], was elected Prime Minister on a [[socialism|socialist]] platform in 1973. Bhutto studied at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Oxford]], where she was President of the [[Oxford Union]]. She returned to Pakistan in 1977, shortly before her father was [[Operation Fair Play|ousted in a military coup]] and executed. Bhutto and her mother [[Nusrat Bhutto|Nusrat]] took control of the PPP and led the country's [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy]]; Bhutto was repeatedly imprisoned by [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s military government and then exiled to Britain in 1984. She returned in 1986 and\u2014influenced by [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] economics\u2014transformed the PPP's platform from a socialist to a liberal one, before leading it to victory in the [[1988 Pakistani general election|1988 election]]. As Prime Minister, her attempts at reform were stifled by [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservative]] and [[Islamism|Islamist]] forces, including President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and the powerful military. Her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism, and dismissed by Khan in 1990. Intelligence services rigged [[1990 Pakistani general election|that year's election]] to ensure a victory for the conservative [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance]] (IJI), at which Bhutto became [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]].\n\nAfter the IJI government of Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] was also dismissed on corruption charges, Bhutto led the PPP to victory in the [[1993 Pakistani general election|1993 elections]]. Her second term oversaw economic privatisation and attempts to advance [[women's rights]]. Her government was damaged by several controversies, including the assassination of her brother [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]], a [[1995 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|failed 1995 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and a further bribery scandal involving her and her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]]; in response to the latter, the President again dismissed her government. The PPP lost the [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997 election]] and in 1998 she went into self-exile in [[Dubai]], leading her party mainly through proxies. A widening corruption inquiry culminated in a 2003 conviction in a Swiss court. Following United States-brokered negotiations with President [[Pervez Musharraf]], she returned to Pakistan in 2007 to compete in the [[2008 Pakistani general election|2008 elections]]; her platform emphasised civilian oversight of the military and opposition to growing Islamist violence. After a political rally in [[Rawalpindi]], she was assassinated. The [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadi]] group [[al-Qaeda]] claimed responsibility, although the involvement of the [[Pakistani Taliban]] and rogue elements of the intelligence services were widely suspected. She was buried at her [[Bhutto family mausoleum|family mausoleum]].\n\nBhutto was a controversial figure. She was often criticised as being politically inexperienced and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corrupt]], and faced much opposition from Pakistan's Islamist lobby for her secularist and modernising agenda. In the early years of her career she was nevertheless domestically popular and also attracted support from Western nations, for whom she was a champion of democracy. Posthumously, she came to be regarded as an icon for women's rights due to her political success in a male-dominated society.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1954\u20131968===\n{{See also|Bhutto family}}\nBhutto was born on 21 June 1953 in the [[Pakistani]] city of [[Karachi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=104|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=10}} Her father was the politician [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and her mother was [[Nusrat Bhutto|Begum Nusrat Ispahani]], of Iranian [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] parentage.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1p=16|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=104|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=8}} Zulfikar was the son of [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]], a prominent politician who had served as Prime Minister of the [[Junagadh State]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1pp=14\u201315|2a1=Bhatia|2y=2008|2pp=12\u201313|3a1=Mu\u00f1oz|3y=2013|3p=20|4a1=Allen|4y=2016|4p=4}} The Bhuttos were aristocratic,{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1p=14|2a1=Lamb|2y=1991|2p=29}} wealthy landlords from [[Sindh]],{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=x}} part of the ''[[waderos]]'' or landed gentry.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=31}} They were [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]],{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=12}} although Nusrat had been born into a [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] family before converting to Sunnism on her marriage.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=8}} The couple had married in September 1951,{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=9}} and Benazir was their first child.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Mu\u00f1oz|2y=2013|2p=19|3a1=Suvorova|3y=2015|3p=104}} She was given the name of an aunt who had died young.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=106}} The Bhutto's three younger children were [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]] (born 1954), Sanam (1957), and [[Shahnawaz Bhutto|Shahnawaz]] (1958).{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=106|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=12}} When Shah Nawaz died in 1957, Zulfikar inherited the family's land holdings, making him extremely wealthy.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], Benazir's father, was Prime Minister of Pakistan and founding chairman of the PPP.]]\n\nBenazir's first language was English; as a child she spoke [[Urdu]] less frequently, and barely spoke the local [[Sindhi language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mu\u00f1oz|1y=2013|1p=19|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=106|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=15}} Benazir initially attended the Lady Jennings Nursery School in Karachi.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=15}} She was then sent to the [[Convent of Jesus and Mary (Karachi)|Convent of Jesus and Mary]] in Karachi and from there to the [[Convent of Jesus and Mary (Murree)|Jesus and Mary Convent]], a boarding school in [[Murree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1pp=13, 14|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=106|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3pp=15, 17}} Murree is near the border with India, and during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] Bhutto and the other pupils underwent air-raid practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=60|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=17}} Taking her exams in December 1968, Bhutto passed her [[O-levels]] with high grades.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=21}}\n\nThroughout her youth, Bhutto idolised her father,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=16}} and he in turn encouraged her educational development in contravention of traditional approaches to women then pervasive in Pakistan.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=14}} Relations between her parents were however strained during her childhood; Zulfikar embarked on extra-marital affairs with other women, and when Nusrat objected he had her thrown out of their house.

Bhutto sought to improve the country's economy which was declining as time was passing. Benazir disagreed with her father's nationalisation and [[socialist economics]].

By the 1990s, Khan and Bhutto's government had also ultimately lost the [[currency war]] with the Indian Rupee which beat the value of Pakistan rupee for the first time in the 1970s. Bhutto's denationalisation program also suffered from many political setbacks, as many of her government members were either directly or indirectly involved with the government corruption in major government-owned industries, and her appointed government members allegedly sabotaged her efforts to privatise the industries.<ref name=Routledge />\n\nOverall, the living standard for people in Pakistan declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as UN sanctions began to take effect. During her first and second term, the difference between rich and poor visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality. According to a calculation completed by the [[Federal Bureau of Statistics]], the standard of living for the rich improved while the standard of living for the poor declined.<ref name=Routledge/> Benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal [[Bangladeshis in Pakistan|Bangladeshi immigration]]. Bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.

General Abdul Waheed was an uptight, strict, and a professional officer with a views of Westernized democracy. Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan]] as Chief of Naval Staff; General [[Abbas Khattak]] as Chief of Air Staff. Whilst, Air Chief Marshal [[Farooq Feroze Khan]] was appointed chairman Joint Chiefs who was the first (and to date only) Pakistani [[air officer]] to have reached to such [[4-star rank|4 star]] assignment. Benazir Bhutto enjoyed a strong relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and President who was hand-picked by her did not questioned her authority. She hand-picked officers and promoted them based on their pro-democracy views while the President gave constitutional authorisation for their promotion. The senior military leadership including [[Jehangir Karamat]], Musharraf, Kayani, [[Ali Kuli Khan]], Farooq Feroze Khan, Abbas Khattak and [[Fasih Bokhari]], had strong Western-democratic views, and were generally close to Bhutto as they had resisted Nawaz Sharif's conservatism. Unlike Nawaz Sharif's second democratic term, Benazir worked with the military on many issues where the military disagreement, solving many problems relating directly to civil\u2013military relations. Her tough and hardline policies on Afghanistan, Kashmir and India, which the military had backed Benazir Bhutto staunchly.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\nAfter the assassination was attempted, Benazir Bhutto's civilian security team headed under [[Rehman Malik]], was disbanded by the Pakistan Army whose [[X Corps (Pakistan)|X-Corps]]' [[111th Infantry Brigade (Pakistan)|111th ''Psychological'' Brigade]]\u2014 an army brigade tasked with countering the [[psychological warfare]]\u2014 took control of the security of Benazir Bhutto, that directly reported to Chief of Army Staff and the Prime Minister. Benazir Bhutto ordered General Abdul Waheed Kakar and the Lieutenant-General [[Javed Ashraf Qazi]] director-general of [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]], to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster, [[Ramzi Yousef]]. After few arrests and intensive manhunt search, the ''ISI'' finally captured Ramzi before he could flee the country. In matter of weeks, Ramzi was secretly extradited to the United States, while the ''ISI'' managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot. In 1995, she personally appointed General [[Naseem Rana]] as the Director-General of the ''ISI'', who later commanded the Pakistan Army's assets in which came to known as \"[[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996\u20132001)|Pakistan's secret war in Afghanistan]]\". During this course, General Rana directly reported to the prime minister, and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by Benazir Bhutto. In 1995, Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Mansurul Haq]] as the Chief of Naval Staff, as the Admiral had personal contacts with the Benazir's family. However, it was the Admiral's large-scale corruption, sponsored by her husband [[Asif Zardari]], that shrunk the credibility of Benazir Bhutto by the end of 1996 that led to end of her government after all.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\n[[File:(Benazir Buttho) Rueda de prensa de Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez y la primera ministra de Paquist\u00e1n.

In her view, \"it was men's interpretation of our religion that restricted women's opportunities, not our religion itself. Islam in fact had been quite progressive towards women from its inception.\"{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=61}} Bhutto described her main role model as [[Fatimah]], the daughter of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], stating that she admired her piety, wisdom, and courage.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} She also described the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a political inspiration.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Personality===\n\n[[File:Benazir bhutto 1988 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bhutto photographed in 1988.

Ahmed]], who went to school with Bhutto, wrote that she was a \"pampered and precocious\" child.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhatia claimed that at Oxford, where he first met her, Bhutto was spoilt, self-obsessed, and prone to throwing temper tantrums, although at the same time was humorous and generous, willing to pay for her friends' meals whenever at a restaurant.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=3}} Allen suggested that Bhutto retained her \"characteristic ''[[wikt:de haut en bas#English|de haut en bas]]'' arrogance, a relic of her feudal upbringing\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=22}} arguing that her key character flaw had been \"a belief in the special, almost sacred destiny of herself and the Bhutto family\" and that accordingly, while she \"spoke like a democrat&nbsp;... she thought and felt as a dynast\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=152}} In later life, Bhutto was accused of being addicted to power, although Allen thought it more accurate to state that she was \"addicted to adulation\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=79}} suggesting that this stemmed from a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] element to Bhutto's personality.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Familial charisma is rare, but in Benazir's case the Bhutto name matters, in that her father's charisma easily transferred to her.

Her chief assets were her intelligence, her confidence, and the fact that she could talk to people of various backgrounds with empathy. She had the rare quality of humour, which she never lost in spite of leading an uncertain and challenging life. Above all, she could use the media effectively. Her faults as a political leader were many. Too many stories of corruption stuck to her. She was not a good administrator. She was too inclined to listen to her small kitchen cabinet, which very often consisted of people who would say what they thought she wanted to hear.

(magazine)|Hello!]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=20}} She read a number of self-help books, telling a friend that \"for all the lows in my life, those self-help books helped me survive, I can tell you\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=21}} Her father had also encouraged her to read the writings of various prominent political figures, among them [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], and [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=101}} She had a love of French and Italian cuisine,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=5}} and was a great fan of the music of American singer [[Neil Diamond]].{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=104}}\n\nIn a 2002 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bhutto described her allegiance to the [[Sufism|Sufi]] branch of Sunni Islam.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Allen thought her to have \"some genuine, if unorthodox, religious belief, mixed up with superstition\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhargava stated that Bhutto was \"dedicated and devout in her religious principles but modern and emancipated in her behaviour and outlook\".{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=38}}  In conversation, she often used the phrase \"[[inshallah]]\", and insisted that the [[Quran]] supported the equality of the sexes.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhutto was [[anti-abortion]] and spoke forcefully against abortion, most notably at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in Cairo, where she accused the West of \"seeking to impose adultery, abortion, intercourse education and other such matters on individuals, societies and religions which have their own social ethos\".<ref>Turner, Brian S.

According to Allen, she would have been aware that a divorce or a public separation would have resulted in the end of her political career in Pakistan due to social stigma around the subject.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=87}} In a 2007 interview, Bhutto said that she and her husband were living apart because of his medical requirements, adding that she visited him every month in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/434530 |title=Destiny's daughter |work=HuffPost}}</ref> Regarding the rumours of separation, in 2008 Bhutto's friend [[Victoria Schofield]] said that the marriage should not be judged by ordinary standards.

In retrospect, her best and worst qualities seem so intimately linked that the course of her career might almost have been predicted.\n|source=\u2014 Biographer Brooke Allen, 2016{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=149}}\n| align = right\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nMu\u00f1oz described Bhutto as \"one of Pakistan's most important political figures, a respected world leader, and the leading stateswoman in the Islamic world\".{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Allen suggested that although Bhutto's record in office was that of a \"corrupt, compromised politician\", Bhutto displayed admirable qualities, especially valour in the face of opposition.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Within the Islamic world, Bhutto was often regarded as \"a genuine Muslim political leader\" and recognised as the head of Pakistan's most popular political party.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhargava expressed the view that at the time of her initial election, Bhutto's \"personal popularity\" was \"tremendous\", larger than any that her father had previously achieved.{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=13}}\n\nAt the same time there were many Pakistanis who despised her, disliking her popularity, her ties to Western nations, and her modernising agenda.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Extremist Sunni Islamist elements opposed her because of  their belief female leaders are un-Islamic, and because they thought she was a Shia Muslim.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=168}} They maintained that her participation in politics meant associating with men to whom she was not related and that this compromised the modesty required by Islam.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=20}} Conservative clerical opponents also claimed that by being prime minister, Bhutto was to fulfilling her religious duty to focus her energies on having as many children as possible.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=19}}\n\nAhmed stated that Bhutto was one of very few political leaders who had been able to \"assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the West while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the Muslim world\".{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} He therefore contrasted her with contemporaries like Iraq's [[Saddam Hussein]] who were popular domestically but hated in the West, and those like Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] who curried favour with Western governments while alienating their domestic audience.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} Bhutto gained popularity in Western nations in part because she could present herself as being \"part of their world\", speaking a high standard of English and having been educated at Harvard and Oxford.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} While her Western supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern, they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counter-terrorism in Pakistan.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Benazir Bhutto memorial coin obverse.JPG|thumb|left|Benazir Bhutto memorial coin, commemorative coin of Pakistan]]\n\nAllen commented that although \"the cards might have been stacked in Bhutto's favor\u2014she was rich, educated, aristocratic, the favoured daughter of a very powerful father\u2014nevertheless, her achievement was a remarkable one\" given the male-dominated environment of late-20th century Pakistani society.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Mushtaq Ahmed similarly believed that \"for a woman to win an election in a male-dominated society was an achievement\",{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} and that \"her victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history.\"{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Ahmed thought that the election of a female Prime Minister in a Muslim-majority country served as \"a proclamation that Islam was a forward-thinking religion\".{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} He added that as a pioneering female leader, Bhutto had \"barely half a dozen\" parallels, among them Indira Gandhi, Thatcher, [[Golda Meir]], [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], and [[Corazon Aquino]].{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Comparisons with Aquino were often made \u2014 and welcomed by Bhutto \u2014 because both women had fought against a military dictatorship and spent time in exile.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1p=43|2a1=Lamb|2y=1991|2p=46|3a1=Ahmed|3y=2005|3p=21}}\nShe became a global icon for women's rights,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=4}} and inspired many

[[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996. She was the first woman to head a democratic government in a [[Muslim majority countries|Muslim majority]] nation. Ideologically a [[liberalism|liberal]] and a [[secularism|secularist]], she chaired or co-chaired the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) from the early 1980s until her [[Assassination of Benazir Bhutto|assassination in 2007]].\n\nOf mixed [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] parentage, Bhutto was born in [[Karachi]] to a [[Bhutto family|politically important, wealthy aristocratic family]]. Her father, the PPP's founder and leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfikar]], was elected Prime Minister on a [[socialism|socialist]] platform in 1973. Bhutto studied at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Oxford]], where she was President of the [[Oxford Union]]. She returned to Pakistan in 1977, shortly before her father was [[Operation Fair Play|ousted in a military coup]] and executed. Bhutto and her mother [[Nusrat Bhutto|Nusrat]] took control of the PPP and led the country's [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy]]; Bhutto was repeatedly imprisoned by [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s military government and then exiled to Britain in 1984. She returned in 1986 and\u2014influenced by [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] economics\u2014transformed the PPP's platform from a socialist to a liberal one, before leading it to victory in the [[1988 Pakistani general election|1988 election]]. As Prime Minister, her attempts at reform were stifled by [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservative]] and [[Islamism|Islamist]] forces, including President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and the powerful military. Her administration was accused of corruption and nepotism, and dismissed by Khan in 1990. Intelligence services rigged [[1990 Pakistani general election|that year's election]] to ensure a victory for the conservative [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance]] (IJI), at which Bhutto became [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]].\n\nAfter the IJI government of Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] was also dismissed on corruption charges, Bhutto led the PPP to victory in the [[1993 Pakistani general election|1993 elections]]. Her second term oversaw economic privatisation and attempts to advance [[women's rights]]. Her government was damaged by several controversies, including the assassination of her brother [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]], a [[1995 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|failed 1995 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and a further bribery scandal involving her and her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]]; in response to the latter, the President again dismissed her government. The PPP lost the [[1997 Pakistani general election|1997 election]] and in 1998 she went into self-exile in [[Dubai]], leading her party mainly through proxies. A widening corruption inquiry culminated in a 2003 conviction in a Swiss court. Following United States-brokered negotiations with President [[Pervez Musharraf]], she returned to Pakistan in 2007 to compete in the [[2008 Pakistani general election|2008 elections]]; her platform emphasised civilian oversight of the military and opposition to growing Islamist violence. After a political rally in [[Rawalpindi]], she was assassinated. The [[Salafi jihadism|Salafi jihadi]] group [[al-Qaeda]] claimed responsibility, although the involvement of the [[Pakistani Taliban]] and rogue elements of the intelligence services were widely suspected. She was buried at her [[Bhutto family mausoleum|family mausoleum]].\n\nBhutto was a controversial figure. She was often criticised as being politically inexperienced and [[Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari|corrupt]], and faced much opposition from Pakistan's Islamist lobby for her secularist and modernising agenda. In the early years of her career she was nevertheless domestically popular and also attracted support from Western nations, for whom she was a champion of democracy. Posthumously, she came to be regarded as an icon for women's rights due to her political success in a male-dominated society.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1954\u20131968===\n{{See also|Bhutto family}}\nBhutto was born on 21 June 1953 in the [[Pakistani]] city of [[Karachi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=104|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=10}} Her father was the politician [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and her mother was [[Nusrat Bhutto|Begum Nusrat Ispahani]], of Iranian [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] parentage.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1p=16|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=104|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=8}} Zulfikar was the son of [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]], a prominent politician who had served as Prime Minister of the [[Junagadh State]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1pp=14\u201315|2a1=Bhatia|2y=2008|2pp=12\u201313|3a1=Mu\u00f1oz|3y=2013|3p=20|4a1=Allen|4y=2016|4p=4}} The Bhuttos were aristocratic,{{sfnm|1a1=Bhargava|1y=1990|1p=14|2a1=Lamb|2y=1991|2p=29}} wealthy landlords from [[Sindh]],{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=x}} part of the ''[[waderos]]'' or landed gentry.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=31}} They were [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]],{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=12}} although Nusrat had been born into a [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] family before converting to Sunnism on her marriage.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=8}} The couple had married in September 1951,{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=9}} and Benazir was their first child.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Mu\u00f1oz|2y=2013|2p=19|3a1=Suvorova|3y=2015|3p=104}} She was given the name of an aunt who had died young.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=106}} The Bhutto's three younger children were [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]] (born 1954), Sanam (1957), and [[Shahnawaz Bhutto|Shahnawaz]] (1958).{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=106|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=12}} When Shah Nawaz died in 1957, Zulfikar inherited the family's land holdings, making him extremely wealthy.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], Benazir's father, was Prime Minister of Pakistan and founding chairman of the PPP.]]\n\nBenazir's first language was English; as a child she spoke [[Urdu]] less frequently, and barely spoke the local [[Sindhi language]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mu\u00f1oz|1y=2013|1p=19|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=106|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3p=15}} Benazir initially attended the Lady Jennings Nursery School in Karachi.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=15}} She was then sent to the [[Convent of Jesus and Mary (Karachi)|Convent of Jesus and Mary]] in Karachi and from there to the [[Convent of Jesus and Mary (Murree)|Jesus and Mary Convent]], a boarding school in [[Murree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1pp=13, 14|2a1=Suvorova|2y=2015|2p=106|3a1=Allen|3y=2016|3pp=15, 17}} Murree is near the border with India, and during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] Bhutto and the other pupils underwent air-raid practices.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=60|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=17}} Taking her exams in December 1968, Bhutto passed her [[O-levels]] with high grades.{{sfnm|1a1=Bhatia|1y=2008|1p=14|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=21}}\n\nThroughout her youth, Bhutto idolised her father,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=16}} and he in turn encouraged her educational development in contravention of traditional approaches to women then pervasive in Pakistan.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=14}} Relations between her parents were however strained during her childhood; Zulfikar embarked on extra-marital affairs with other women, and when Nusrat objected he had her thrown out of their house.

He convinced Pakistan to step back from hostilities and to disband the Kashmiri militant training camps in its territory.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=107}}\n\nAfter Bhutto became Prime Minister, President Khan and the military were reluctant to tell her about Pakistan's nuclear programme,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=76}} and it remains unknown how much Bhutto knew about the issue during her first term in office.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=105}} She later related that to find out more she contacted key scientists in the program, such as [[A. Q. Khan]], herself, bypassing the president and military hierarchy.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=76}} On her trip to the United States, she told Congress that \"we do not possess, nor do we intend to make, a nuclear device\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mu\u00f1oz|1y=2013|1p=100|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=106}} While in Washington D.C., she met with CIA director [[William H.

W. Bush]] informed her that U.S. military aid to the country would cease unless Pakistan refrained from producing nuclear bomb cores, the final step in creating the weapon.{{sfn|Allen|2016|pp=105\u2013106}} Between January and March 1989, she authorised cold tests of nuclear weaponry, without fissionable material, although this did not satisfy the military authorities.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=76}} In 1990, shortly before leaving office, the American Ambassador [[Robert B.

Bhutto sought to improve the country's economy which was declining as time was passing. Benazir disagreed with her father's nationalisation and [[socialist economics]].

By the 1990s, Khan and Bhutto's government had also ultimately lost the [[currency war]] with the Indian Rupee which beat the value of Pakistan rupee for the first time in the 1970s.

During her first and second term, the difference between rich and poor visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality. According to a calculation completed by the [[Federal Bureau of Statistics]], the standard of living for the rich improved while the standard of living for the poor declined.<ref name=Routledge/> Benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal [[Bangladeshis in Pakistan|Bangladeshi immigration]]. Bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Her action strained and created tensions in [[Bangladesh\u2013Pakistan relations]], as Bangladesh Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]] refused to accept the deportees and reportedly sent two planeloads back to Pakistan.

General Abdul Waheed was an uptight, strict, and a professional officer with a views of Westernized democracy. Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan]] as Chief of Naval Staff; General [[Abbas Khattak]] as Chief of Air Staff. Whilst, Air Chief Marshal [[Farooq Feroze Khan]] was appointed chairman Joint Chiefs who was the first (and to date only) Pakistani [[air officer]] to have reached to such [[4-star rank|4 star]] assignment. Benazir Bhutto enjoyed a strong relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and President who was hand-picked by her did not questioned her authority. She hand-picked officers and promoted them based on their pro-democracy views while the President gave constitutional authorisation for their promotion. The senior military leadership including [[Jehangir Karamat]], Musharraf, Kayani, [[Ali Kuli Khan]], Farooq Feroze Khan, Abbas Khattak and [[Fasih Bokhari]], had strong Western-democratic views, and were generally close to Bhutto as they had resisted Nawaz Sharif's conservatism. Unlike Nawaz Sharif's second democratic term, Benazir worked with the military on many issues where the military disagreement, solving many problems relating directly to civil\u2013military relations. Her tough and hardline policies on Afghanistan, Kashmir and India, which the military had backed Benazir Bhutto staunchly.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\nAfter the assassination was attempted, Benazir Bhutto's civilian security team headed under [[Rehman Malik]], was disbanded by the Pakistan Army whose [[X Corps (Pakistan)|X-Corps]]' [[111th Infantry Brigade (Pakistan)|111th ''Psychological'' Brigade]]\u2014 an army brigade tasked with countering the [[psychological warfare]]\u2014 took control of the security of Benazir Bhutto, that directly reported to Chief of Army Staff and the Prime Minister. Benazir Bhutto ordered General Abdul Waheed Kakar and the Lieutenant-General [[Javed Ashraf Qazi]] director-general of [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]], to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster, [[Ramzi Yousef]]. After few arrests and intensive manhunt search, the ''ISI'' finally captured Ramzi before he could flee the country. In matter of weeks, Ramzi was secretly extradited to the United States, while the ''ISI'' managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot. In 1995, she personally appointed General [[Naseem Rana]] as the Director-General of the ''ISI'', who later commanded the Pakistan Army's assets in which came to known as \"[[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996\u20132001)|Pakistan's secret war in Afghanistan]]\". During this course, General Rana directly reported to the prime minister, and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by Benazir Bhutto. In 1995, Benazir also appointed Admiral [[Mansurul Haq]] as the Chief of Naval Staff, as the Admiral had personal contacts with the Benazir's family. However, it was the Admiral's large-scale corruption, sponsored by her husband [[Asif Zardari]], that shrunk the credibility of Benazir Bhutto by the end of 1996 that led to end of her government after all.<ref name=Mazhar />\n\n[[File:(Benazir Buttho) Rueda de prensa de Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez y la primera ministra de Paquist\u00e1n.

Bhargava thought that in the context of Pakistani politics, she could \"pass\" for a [[social democracy|social democrat]].{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=18}} Her friend Catherine Drucker, who knew her while the two women were at Oxford University, said Bhutto's political views were then akin to those \"commonplace\" within the \"mild leftism of the day\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=38}} Bhargava added that, through her education in governance and politics at Harvard and then Oxford, Bhutto had \"a thorough exposure to political theory and practice, in historical perspective as well as in the contemporary setting\".{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=22}}\n\nBhutto admired the [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] economic policies pursued by Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom;{{sfn|Lamb|1991|p=30}} she was, according to biographer Mushtaq Ahmed, a \"zealous convert\" to privatisation and market economics.{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=284}} Bhutto advocated the creation of an expanded economically and politically stable middle class in Pakistan, believing that this was needed in order to sustain a stable democratic state.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=228}} Allen commented that although the PPP had once been officially socialist in ideology, Bhutto \"was not a natural socialist, or even as adept at talking the talk as Zulfikar had been\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=102}} She disagreed with her father's socialist economic policies, and when in power sought to privatise various industries that had been nationalised in the 1970s.{{sfn|Allen|2016|pp=102\u2013103}} Ahmed thus suggested that while under Bhutto the PPP continued to profess ideals of egalitarianism and claimed it would enhance the welfare of peasants and workers, such \"progressive phraseology\" couched an absence of economic policies to benefit the poor.{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|pp=136, 271}} Instead, Ahmed thought, its policies primarily benefited \"the privileged classes\" and was thus a right-wing rather than left-wing party.{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=284}}\n\nDuring her years in office Bhutto also did nothing to seriously challenge the [[feudalism|feudal]] nature of rural Pakistan.{{sfnm|1a1=Ahmed|1y=2005|1p=311|2a1=Allen|2y=2016|2p=103}} Under Bhutto, Ahmed wrote, people from the wealthy feudal class dominated the PPP \"both at the federal and provincial levels\".{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=313}} Bhargava suggested that, because of the period in which she was operating, Bhutto did not need to engage in the \"verbal radicalism\" employed by her father, not needing to \"clamour for a socialist identity\" in order to win votes and allowing her to be \"a pragmatist in both word and deed\".{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=12}} Lamb described Bhutto at being skilled in using [[populism|populist]] strategies in election campaigns.{{sfn|Lamb|1991|p=94}} In a 2007 article for the ''Los Angeles Times'', Bhutto's niece, [[Fatima Bhutto]], called her \"a puppet 'democrat{{'\"}} linked to the U.S. government's [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] agenda.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=138}}\n\n[[File:M.M.Chandio with BB.jpg|thumb|left|Bhutto meeting with M.

In her view, \"it was men's interpretation of our religion that restricted women's opportunities, not our religion itself. Islam in fact had been quite progressive towards women from its inception.\"{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=61}} Bhutto described her main role model as [[Fatimah]], the daughter of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], stating that she admired her piety, wisdom, and courage.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} She also described the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a political inspiration.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Personality===\n\n[[File:Benazir bhutto 1988 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bhutto photographed in 1988.

Ahmed]], who went to school with Bhutto, wrote that she was a \"pampered and precocious\" child.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhatia claimed that at Oxford, where he first met her, Bhutto was spoilt, self-obsessed, and prone to throwing temper tantrums, although at the same time was humorous and generous, willing to pay for her friends' meals whenever at a restaurant.{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=3}} Allen suggested that Bhutto retained her \"characteristic ''[[wikt:de haut en bas#English|de haut en bas]]'' arrogance, a relic of her feudal upbringing\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=22}} arguing that her key character flaw had been \"a belief in the special, almost sacred destiny of herself and the Bhutto family\" and that accordingly, while she \"spoke like a democrat&nbsp;... she thought and felt as a dynast\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=152}} In later life, Bhutto was accused of being addicted to power, although Allen thought it more accurate to state that she was \"addicted to adulation\",{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=79}} suggesting that this stemmed from a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] element to Bhutto's personality.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Familial charisma is rare, but in Benazir's case the Bhutto name matters, in that her father's charisma easily transferred to her. She had her own charisma when she emerged in the 1980s as a young, articulate, well-educated and well-spoken woman. Her chief assets were her intelligence, her confidence, and the fact that she could talk to people of various backgrounds with empathy. She had the rare quality of humour, which she never lost in spite of leading an uncertain and challenging life. Above all, she could use the media effectively. Her faults as a political leader were many. Too many stories of corruption stuck to her. She was not a good administrator. She was too inclined to listen to her small kitchen cabinet, which very often consisted of people who would say what they thought she wanted to hear.

(magazine)|Hello!]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=20}} She read a number of self-help books, telling a friend that \"for all the lows in my life, those self-help books helped me survive, I can tell you\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=21}} Her father had also encouraged her to read the writings of various prominent political figures, among them [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], and [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=101}} She had a love of French and Italian cuisine,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=5}} and was a great fan of the music of American singer [[Neil Diamond]].{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=104}}\n\nIn a 2002 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bhutto described her allegiance to the [[Sufism|Sufi]] branch of Sunni Islam.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Allen thought her to have \"some genuine, if unorthodox, religious belief, mixed up with superstition\".{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhargava stated that Bhutto was \"dedicated and devout in her religious principles but modern and emancipated in her behaviour and outlook\".{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=38}}  In conversation, she often used the phrase \"[[inshallah]]\", and insisted that the [[Quran]] supported the equality of the sexes.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=55}} Bhutto was [[anti-abortion]] and spoke forcefully against abortion, most notably at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in Cairo, where she accused the West of \"seeking to impose adultery, abortion, intercourse education and other such matters on individuals, societies and religions which have their own social ethos\".<ref>Turner, Brian S.

stateswoman in the Islamic world\".{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Allen suggested that although Bhutto's record in office was that of a \"corrupt, compromised politician\", Bhutto displayed admirable qualities, especially valour in the face of opposition.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Within the Islamic world, Bhutto was often regarded as \"a genuine Muslim political leader\" and recognised as the head of Pakistan's most popular political party.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} Bhargava expressed the view that at the time of her initial election, Bhutto's \"personal popularity\" was \"tremendous\", larger than any that her father had previously achieved.{{sfn|Bhargava|1990|p=13}}\n\nAt the same time there were many Pakistanis who despised her, disliking her popularity, her ties to Western nations, and her modernising agenda.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=19}} Extremist Sunni Islamist elements opposed her because of  their belief female leaders are un-Islamic, and because they thought she was a Shia Muslim.{{sfn|Mu\u00f1oz|2013|p=168}} They maintained that her participation in politics meant associating with men to whom she was not related and that this compromised the modesty required by Islam.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=20}} Conservative clerical opponents also claimed that by being prime minister, Bhutto was to fulfilling her religious duty to focus her energies on having as many children as possible.{{sfn|Suvorova|2015|p=19}}\n\nAhmed stated that Bhutto was one of very few political leaders who had been able to \"assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the West while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the Muslim world\".{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} He therefore contrasted her with contemporaries like Iraq's [[Saddam Hussein]] who were popular domestically but hated in the West, and those like Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] who curried favour with Western governments while alienating their domestic audience.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=5}} Bhutto gained popularity in Western nations in part because she could present herself as being \"part of their world\", speaking a high standard of English and having been educated at Harvard and Oxford.{{sfn|Houtman|Ahmed|2008|p=4}} While her Western supporters sometimes had doubts about her ability to govern, they generally viewed her as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and

achievement was a remarkable one\" given the male-dominated environment of late-20th century Pakistani society.{{sfn|Allen|2016|p=150}} Mushtaq Ahmed similarly believed that \"for a woman to win an election in a male-dominated society was an achievement\",{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} and that \"her victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history.\"{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Ahmed thought that the election of a female Prime Minister in a Muslim-majority country served as \"a proclamation that Islam was a forward-thinking religion\".{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=i}} He added that as a pioneering female leader, Bhutto had \"barely half a dozen\" parallels, among them Indira Gandhi, Thatcher, [[Golda Meir]], [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], and [[Corazon Aquino]].{{sfn|Ahmed|2005|p=21}} Comparisons with Aquino were often made \u2014 and welcomed by Bhutto \u2014 because both women had fought against a military dictatorship

Atlas was created in a joint development effort among the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], [[Ferranti|Ferranti International plc]] and the [[Plessey|Plessey Co., plc]]. Two other Atlas machines were built: one for [[BP|British Petroleum]] and the [[University of London]], and one for the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] at Chilton near [[Oxford]].\n\nA derivative system was built by Ferranti for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Called the [[Titan (1963 computer)|Titan]], or Atlas 2,<ref>{{cite journal |title=COMPUTERS AND CENTERS, OVERSEAS: 2. Ferranti Ltd., Atlas 2 Computer, London Wl, England |journal=Digital Computer Newsletter |date=1964 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=13\u201315 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0694639 |language=en}}</ref> it had a different memory organisation and ran a [[time-sharing]] operating system developed by Cambridge University Computer Laboratory.  Two further Atlas 2s were delivered: one to the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] Centre in Cambridge (later called CADCentre, then [[AVEVA]]), and the other to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE), Aldermaston.\n\nThe University of Manchester's Atlas was decommissioned in 1971.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=43|ps=}} The final Atlas, the CADCentre machine, was switched off in late 1976.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=44|ps=}} Parts of the Chilton Atlas are preserved by [[National Museums Scotland]] in Edinburgh; the main console itself was rediscovered in July 2014 and is at [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] in Chilton, near [[Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThrough 1956 there was a growing awareness that the UK was falling behind the US in computer development. In April, B.W. Pollard of Ferranti told a computer conference that \"there is in this country a range of medium-speed computers, and the only two machines which are really fast are the Cambridge EDSAC 2 and the Manchester Mark 2, although both are still very slow compared with the fastest American machines.\"{{sfn|Lavington|1975|pp=30-31}} This was followed by similar concerns expressed in May report to the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] Advisory Committee on High Speed Calculating Machines, better known as the Brunt Committee.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=30}}\n\nThrough this period, [[Tom Kilburn]]'s team at [[Manchester University]] had been experimenting with [[transistor]]-based systems, building two small machines to test various techniques. This was clearly the way forward, and in the fall of 1956, Kilburn began canvassing possible customers on what features they would want in a new transistor-based machine. Most commercial customers pointed out the need to support a wide variety of peripheral devices, while the [[Atomic Energy Authority]] suggested a machine able to perform an instruction every microsecond,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=31}} or as it would be known today, 1 MFLOP of performance.

A program that processes data from a [[card reader]], for instance, will spend the vast majority of its time waiting for the reader to send in the next bit of data. To support these devices while still making efficient use of the [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the new system would need to have additional memory to buffer data and have an [[operating system]] that could coordinate the flow of data around the system.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\n===Muse becomes Atlas===\nWhen the Brunt Committee heard of new and much faster US designs, the [[Univac LARC]] and [[IBM STRETCH]], they were able to gain the attention of the [[National Research Development Corporation]] (NDRC), responsible for moving technologies from war-era research groups into the market. Over the next eighteen months, they held numerous meetings with prospective customers, engineering teams at Ferranti an [[EMI]], and design teams at Manchester and the [[Royal Radar Establishment]].{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\nIn spite of all this effort, by the summer of 1958, there was still no funding available from the NDRC. Kilburn decided to move things along by building a smaller Muse to experiment with various concepts. This was paid for using funding from the Mark 1 Computer Earnings Fund, which collected funds by renting out time on the University's Mark 1. Soon after the project started, in October 1958, Ferranti decided to become involved. In May 1959 they received a grant of \u00a3300,000 from the NDRC to build the system, which would be returned from the proceeds of sales. At some point during this process, the machine was renamed Atlas.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=32}}\n\nThe detailed design was completed by the end of 1959, and the construction of the [[compiler]]s was proceeding. However, the Supervisor operating system was already well behind.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=33}} This led to David Howarth, newly hired at Ferranti, expanding the operating system team from two to six programmers. In what is described as a herculean effort, led by the tireless and energetic Howarth,{{efn|Howarth completed his Ph.D. in physics at age 22.}} the team eventually delivered a Supervisor consisting of 35,000 lines of [[assembler language]] which had support for [[multiprogramming]] to solve the problem of peripheral handling.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=34}}\n\n===Atlas installations===\nThe first Atlas was built up at the university throughout 1962. The schedule was further constrained by the planned shutdown of the [[Ferranti Mercury]] machine at the end of December. Atlas met this goal, and was officially commissioned on 7 December by [[John Cockroft]], director of the AEA.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=34}} This system had only an early version of Supervisor, and the only compiler was for [[Autocode]]. It was not until January 1964 that the final version of Supervisor was installed, along with compilers for [[ALGOL 60]] and [[Fortran]].{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=35}}\n\nBy the mid-1960s the original machine was in continual use, based on a 20-hour-per-day schedule, during which time as many as 1,000 programs might be run. Time was split between the University and Ferranti, the latter of which charged \u00a3500 an hour to its customers. A portion of this was returned to the University Computer Earnings Fund.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=35}} In 1969, it was estimated that the computer time received by the University would cost \u20a4720,000 if it had been leased on the open market. The machine was shut down on 30 November 1971.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=36}}\n\nFerranti sold two other Atlas installations, one to a joint consortium of [[London University]] and [[British Petroleum]] in 1963, and another to the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (Harwell) in December 1964. The AEA machine was later moved to the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton, a few yards outside the boundary fence of Harwell, which placed it on civilian lands and thus much easier to access. This installation grew to be the largest Atlas, containing 48&nbsp;kWords of 48-bit [[core memory]] and 32 tape drives. Time was made available to all UK universities. It was shut down in March 1974.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=37}}\n\n===Titan and Atlas 2===\n{{main|Titan (1963 computer)}}\n\nIn February 1962, Ferranti gave some parts of an Atlas machine to [[Cambridge University]], and in return, the University would use these to develop a cheaper version of the system. The result was the Titan machine, which became operational in the summer of 1963. Ferranti sold two more of this design under the name Titan 2, one to the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (Aldermaston) in 1963, and another to the government-sponsored Computer Aided Design Center in 1966.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=38}}\n\n===Legacy===\nAtlas had been designed as a response to the US LARC and STRETCH programs. Both ultimately beat Atlas into official use, LARC in 1961, and STRETCH a few months before Atlas. Atlas was much faster than LARC, about four times, and ran slightly slower than STRETCH - Atlas added two [[floating-point]] numbers in about 1.59 microseconds,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=35}} while STRETCH did the same in 1.38 to 1.5 microseconds. No further sales of LARC were attempted,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=38}} although it is not clear how many STRETCH machines were ultimately produced.\n\nIt was not until 1964's arrival of the [[CDC 6600]] that the Atlas was significantly bested. CDC later stated that it was a 1959 description of Muse that gave CDC ideas that significantly accelerated the development of the 6600 and allowed it to be delivered earlier than originally estimated.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=38}} This led to it winning a contract for the [[CSIRO]] in Australia, which had originally been in discussions to buy an Atlas.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=38}}\n\nFerranti was having serious financial difficulties in the early 1960s, and decided to sell the computer division to [[International Computers and Tabulators]] (ICT) in 1963. ICT decided to focus on the mid-range market with their [[ICT 1900 series]],{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=39}} a flexible range of machines based on the Canadian [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]].\n\n==Technical description==\n\n===Hardware===\n\nThe machine had many innovative features, but the key operating parameters were as follows (the store size relates to the Manchester installation; the others were larger):\n* [[48-bit]] [[word size]]. A word could hold one floating-point number, one instruction, two 24-bit addresses or signed integers, or eight 6-bit characters.\n* A fast [[Adder (electronics)|adder]] that used novel circuitry to minimise carry propagation time.\n* 24-bit (2&nbsp;million words, 16 million characters) [[address space]] that embraced supervisor ('sacred') store, V-store, fixed store and the user store\n* 16[[Kibi-|K]] words of [[magnetic core memory|core store]] (equivalent to 96 [[kibibyte|KB]]), featuring interleaving of odd/even addresses\n* 8[[Kibi-|K]] words of read-only memory (referred to as the fixed store). This contained the supervisor and extracode routines.\n* 96K words of [[drum memory|drum store]] (eqv. to 576 KB), split across four drums but integrated with the core store using [[virtual memory]]\n* 128 high-speed [[index register]]s (B-lines) that could be used for address modification in the mostly double-modified instructions. The register address space also included special registers such as the extracode operand address and the exponent of the [[floating-point]] [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]. Three of the 128 registers were [[program counter]] registers: 125 was supervisor (interrupt) control, 126 was extracode control, and 127 was user control. Register 0 always held value 0.\n* Capability for the addition of (for the time) sophisticated new [[peripheral]]s such as [[magnetic tape]], including [[Direct memory access|direct memory access (DMA)]] facilities\n* Peripheral control through V-store addresses ([[memory-mapped I/O]]), [[interrupts]] and extracode routines, by reading and writing special wired-in store addresses.\n* An associative memory ([[content-addressable memory]]) of [[page address register]]s to determine whether the desired virtual memory location was in core store\n* [[Instruction pipeline|Instruction pipelining]]\n\nAtlas did not use a synchronous clocking mechanism\u2014it was an [[asynchronous Processor]]\u2014so performance measurements were not easy but as an example:\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] [[processor register|register]] add&nbsp;\u2013 1.59 [[microsecond]]s\n* [[Floating-point]] add, no modification&nbsp;\u2013 1.61 microseconds\n* Floating-point add, double modify&nbsp;\u2013 2.61 microseconds\n* Floating-point multiply, double modify&nbsp;\u2013 4.97 microseconds\n\n===Extracode===\n\nOne feature of the Atlas was \"Extracode\", a technique that allowed complex instructions to be implemented in software. Dedicated hardware expedited entry to and return from the extracode routine and operand access; also, the code of the extracode routines was stored in ROM, which could be accessed faster than the core store.\n\nThe uppermost ten [[bit]]s of a 48-bit Atlas machine instruction were the [[Opcode|operation code]]. If the [[most significant bit]] was set to zero, this was an ordinary machine instruction executed directly by the hardware. If the uppermost bit was set to one, this was an Extracode and was implemented as a special kind of [[subroutine]] jump to a location in the fixed store ([[Read-only memory|ROM]]), its [[memory address|address]] being determined by the other nine bits.  About 250&nbsp;extracodes were implemented, of the 512 possible.\n\nExtracodes were what would be called [[Interrupt|software interrupt]] or [[trap (computing)|trap]] today. They were used to call mathematical [[Procedure (computer science)|procedures]] which would have been too inefficient to implement in [[computer hardware|hardware]], for example [[sine]], [[logarithm]], and [[square root]]. But about half of the codes were designated as Supervisor functions, which invoked [[operating system]] procedures. Typical examples would be \"Print the specified character on the specified stream\" or \"Read a block of 512 words from logical tape N\". Extracodes were the only means by which a [[computer program|program]] could communicate with the Supervisor. Other UK machines of the era, such as the [[Ferranti Orion]], had similar mechanisms for calling on the services of their operating systems.\n\n===Software===\nAtlas pioneered many software concepts still in common use today, including the [[Atlas Supervisor]], \"considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1980|pp=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first [[high-level language]]s available on Atlas was named [[Atlas Autocode]], which was contemporary to Algol&nbsp;60 and created specifically to address what Tony Brooker perceived to be some defects in Algol&nbsp;60. The Atlas did however support [[Algol 60]], as well as [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]], and ABL (Atlas Basic Language, a symbolic input language close to machine language). Being a university computer it was patronised by a large number of the student population, who had access to a protected [[machine code]] development environment.\n<!-- What other [[operating system]]s and [[programming language]]s were available on the Atlas? [[CPL]] was intended to be made available. -->\n\nSeveral of the compilers were written useing the [[Compiler-compiler|Compiler Compiler]], considered to be the first of its type.\n\nIt also had a programming language called SPG = System Program Generator. At run time an SPG program could compile more program for itself. It could define and use [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Its variables were in <angle brackets> and it had a text parser, giving SPG program text a resemblance to [[Backus\u2013Naur form]].\n\n===Hardware/software integration===\n\nFrom the outset, Atlas was conceived as a supercomputer that would include a comprehensive operating system. The hardware included specific features that facilitated the work of the operating system. For example, the extracode routines and the interrupt routines each had dedicated storage, registers and program counters; a [[context switch]] from user mode to extracode mode or executive mode, or from extracode mode to executive mode, was therefore very fast.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Manchester computers]]\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation | last = Edwards | first = Dai | title = Designing and Building Atlas | journal = Resurrection: The Bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society | volume = 62 | pages = 9\u201318 | date = Summer 2013  | url = http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection.htm | issn =0958-7403 }}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=Early British Computers |year=1980 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-0803-4}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1975 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfManchesterComputers}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1998 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Parallel addition in digital computers: A new fast 'carry' circuit, T.

Atlas was created in a joint development effort among the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], [[Ferranti|Ferranti International plc]] and the [[Plessey|Plessey Co., plc]]. Two other Atlas machines were built: one for [[BP|British Petroleum]] and the [[University of London]], and one for the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] at Chilton near [[Oxford]].\n\nA derivative system was built by Ferranti for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Called the [[Titan (1963 computer)|Titan]], or Atlas 2,<ref>{{cite journal |title=COMPUTERS AND CENTERS, OVERSEAS: 2.

Two further Atlas 2s were delivered: one to the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] Centre in Cambridge (later called CADCentre, then [[AVEVA]]), and the other to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE), Aldermaston.\n\nThe University of Manchester's Atlas was decommissioned in 1971.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=43|ps=}} The final Atlas, the CADCentre machine, was switched off in late 1976.{{sfn|Lavington|1998|p=44|ps=}} Parts of the Chilton Atlas are preserved by [[National Museums Scotland]] in Edinburgh; the main console itself was rediscovered in July 2014 and is at [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] in Chilton, near [[Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nThrough 1956 there was a growing awareness that the UK was falling behind the US in computer development. In April, B.W. Pollard of Ferranti told a computer conference that \"there is in this country a range of medium-speed computers, and the only two machines which are really fast are the Cambridge EDSAC 2 and the Manchester Mark 2, although both are still very slow compared with the fastest American machines.\"{{sfn|Lavington|1975|pp=30-31}} This was followed by similar concerns expressed in May report to the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] Advisory Committee on High Speed Calculating Machines, better known as the Brunt Committee.{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=30}}\n\nThrough this period, [[Tom Kilburn]]'s team at [[Manchester University]] had been experimenting with [[transistor]]-based systems, building two small machines to test various techniques. This was clearly the way forward, and in the fall of 1956, Kilburn began canvassing possible customers on what features they would want in a new transistor-based machine. Most commercial customers pointed out the need to support a wide variety of peripheral devices, while the [[Atomic Energy Authority]] suggested a machine able to perform an instruction every microsecond,{{sfn|Lavington|1975|p=31}} or as it would be known today, 1 MFLOP of performance. This later request led to the name of the prospective design, Muse, for MicroSecond Engine.<ref>{{citation |title=The Atlas |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/atlas/atlas.html |publisher=University of Manchester |accessdate=21 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728105352/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/atlas/atlas.html |archive-date=28 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe need to support many peripherals and the need to run fast are naturally at odds.

Register 0 always held value 0.\n* Capability for the addition of (for the time) sophisticated new [[peripheral]]s such as [[magnetic tape]], including [[Direct memory access|direct memory access (DMA)]] facilities\n* Peripheral control through V-store addresses ([[memory-mapped I/O]]), [[interrupts]] and extracode routines, by reading and writing special wired-in store addresses.\n* An associative memory ([[content-addressable memory]]) of [[page address register]]s to determine whether the desired virtual memory location was in core store\n* [[Instruction pipeline|Instruction pipelining]]\n\nAtlas did not use a synchronous clocking mechanism\u2014it was an [[asynchronous Processor]]\u2014so performance measurements were not easy but as an example:\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point]] [[processor register|register]] add&nbsp;\u2013 1.59 [[microsecond]]s\n* [[Floating-point]] add, no modification&nbsp;\u2013 1.61 microseconds\n* Floating-point add, double modify&nbsp;\u2013 2.61 microseconds\n* Floating-point multiply, double modify&nbsp;\u2013 4.97 microseconds\n\n===Extracode===\n\nOne feature of the Atlas was \"Extracode\", a technique that allowed complex instructions to be implemented in software. Dedicated hardware expedited entry to and return from the extracode routine and operand access; also, the code of the extracode routines was stored in ROM, which could be accessed faster than the core store.\n\nThe uppermost ten [[bit]]s of a 48-bit Atlas machine instruction were the [[Opcode|operation code]]. If the [[most significant bit]] was set to zero, this was an ordinary machine instruction executed directly by the hardware. If the uppermost bit was set to one, this was an Extracode and was implemented as a special kind of [[subroutine]] jump to a location in the fixed store ([[Read-only memory|ROM]]), its [[memory address|address]] being determined by the other nine bits.  About 250&nbsp;extracodes were implemented, of the 512 possible.\n\nExtracodes were what would be called [[Interrupt|software interrupt]] or [[trap (computing)|trap]] today. They were used to call mathematical [[Procedure (computer science)|procedures]] which would have been too inefficient to implement in [[computer hardware|hardware]], for example [[sine]], [[logarithm]], and [[square root]]. But about half of the codes were designated as Supervisor functions, which invoked [[operating system]] procedures. Typical examples would be \"Print the specified character on the specified stream\" or \"Read a block of 512 words from logical tape N\". Extracodes were the only means by which a [[computer program|program]] could communicate with the Supervisor. Other UK machines of the era, such as the [[Ferranti Orion]], had similar mechanisms for calling on the services of their operating systems.\n\n===Software===\nAtlas pioneered many software concepts still in common use today, including the [[Atlas Supervisor]], \"considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1980|pp=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first [[high-level language]]s available on Atlas was named [[Atlas Autocode]], which was contemporary to Algol&nbsp;60 and created specifically to address what Tony Brooker perceived to be some defects in Algol&nbsp;60. The Atlas did however support [[Algol 60]], as well as [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]], and ABL (Atlas machine code). Being a university computer it was patronised by a large number of the student population, who had access to a protected [[machine code]] development environment.\n<!-- What other [[operating system]]s and [[programming language]]s were available on the Atlas? [[CPL]] was intended to be made available. -->\n\nSeveral of the compilers were written useing the [[Compiler-compiler|Compiler Compiler]], considered to be the first of its type.\n\nIt also had a programming language called SPG = System Program Generator. At run time an SPG program could compile more program for itself. It could define and use [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Its variables were in <angle brackets> and it had a text parser, giving SPG program text a resemblance to [[Backus\u2013Naur form]].\n\n===Hardware/software integration===\n\nFrom the outset, Atlas was conceived as a supercomputer that would include a comprehensive operating system. The hardware included specific features that facilitated the work of the operating system. For example, the extracode routines and the interrupt routines each had dedicated storage, registers and program counters; a [[context switch]] from user mode to extracode mode or executive mode, or from extracode mode to executive mode, was therefore very fast.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Manchester computers]]\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation | last = Edwards | first = Dai | title = Designing and Building Atlas | journal = Resurrection: The Bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society | volume = 62 | pages = 9\u201318 | date = Summer 2013  | url = http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection.htm | issn =0958-7403 }}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=Early British Computers |year=1980 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-0803-4}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1975 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfManchesterComputers}}\n*{{citation |last=Lavington |first=Simon |title=A History of Manchester Computers |year=1998 |publisher=The British Computer Society |location=Swindon |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-902505-01-5}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Parallel addition in digital computers: A new fast 'carry' circuit, T.
