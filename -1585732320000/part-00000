Sometimes, these associated extra-intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease, such as painful arthritic knees in teenagers, which also may be seen in adults. A diagnosis of UC may not occur until the onset of intestinal manifestations, however.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Extent of involvement====\n[[File:Intestine-diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of the human intestine]]\nUlcerative colitis is normally continuous from the rectum up the colon.

Mild abdominal pain or cramping may occur. People with UC may believe they are [[constipation|constipated]] when in fact they are experiencing [[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]], which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n*Moderate disease correlates with more than four stools daily, but with minimal signs of toxicity. People may display anemia (not requiring transfusions), moderate abdominal pain, and low-grade [[fever]], {{convert|38|to|39|C|F}}.\n*Severe disease correlates with more than six bloody stools a day or observable massive and significant bloody bowel movement, and evidence of toxicity as demonstrated by fever, [[tachycardia]], anemia or an elevated ESR or CRP.\n*Fulminant disease correlates with more than 10 bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement, and colonic dilation (expansion). People in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to [[toxic megacolon]]. If the [[serous membrane]] is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue.

Human colonic mucosa is maintained by the colonic epithelial barrier and immune cells in the lamina propria (see [[intestinal mucosal barrier]]). N-butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, gets oxidized through the [[beta oxidation]] pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It has been shown that N-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the protective benefit of smoking in ulcerative colitis is due to the [[hydrogen cyanide]] from cigarette smoke reacting with hydrogen sulfide to produce the non-toxic isothiocyanate, thereby inhibiting sulfides from interrupting the pathway.<ref name=Levine>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine J, Ellis CJ, Furne JK, Springfield J, Levitt MD | title = Fecal hydrogen sulfide production in ulcerative colitis | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 83\u20137 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9448181 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.083_c.x | df = dmy-all | doi-broken-date = 2020-03-01 }}</ref> An unrelated study suggested that the sulfur contained in red meats and alcohol may lead to an increased risk of relapse for people in remission.<ref name=Roediger/>\n\nPeople with ulcerative colitis typically present with rectal bleeding, diarrhea, tenesmus (urgent desire to evacuate the bowels but with the passage of little stool), and lower abdominal pain. The severity of disease at clinical presentation is important in determining the appropriate therapy. Peoples with mildly active disease will have fewer than 4 bowel movements daily and no signs of toxicity. Individuals with moderate-severity UC have more frequent bowel movements with bleeding. Approximately 70% of people with ulcerative colitis will have moderately active disease at presentation. People with severely active disease will have signs of toxicity with fever, tachycardia, and anemia. People with fulminant or toxic colitis or toxic megacolon often have more than 10 bowel movements in a day, continuous bleeding, abdominal distention and tenderness, and radiologic evidence of edema and, in some cases, bowel dilation. These people most often require immediate [[colectomy]] because 10% have perforated colon at the time of surgery.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Image:Ulcerative colitis (2) active.jpg|thumb|H&E stain of a colonic biopsy showing a crypt abscess, a classic finding in ulcerative colitis]]\nThe initial [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] workup for ulcerative colitis includes the following:<ref name=ACGGuideline>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornbluth A, Sachar DB | title = Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults (update): American College of Gastroenterology, Practice Parameters Committee | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 1371\u201385 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15233681 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.40036.x | doi-broken-date = 2020-03-01 }}</ref><ref name=emed2336>{{eMedicine|med|2336|Ulcerative colitis}}</ref>\n\n* A [[complete blood count]] is done to check for anemia; [[thrombocytosis]], a high [[platelet]] count, is occasionally seen\n* [[Electrolyte]] studies and [[renal function|kidney function tests]] are done, as chronic diarrhea may be associated with [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]] and pre-kidney failure.\n* [[Liver function tests]] are performed to screen for bile duct involvement: [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]].\n* [[X-ray]]\n* [[Urinalysis]]\n* Stool culture, to rule out parasites and infectious causes.\n* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be measured, with an elevated sedimentation rate indicating that an inflammatory process is present.\n* [[C-reactive protein]] can be measured, with an elevated level being another indication of inflammation.\n* [[Sigmoidoscopy]] a type of endoscopy which can detect the presence of ulcers in the rectum and lower section of the large intestine.\n*[[Colonoscopy]] a type of endoscopy which can the full length of the large intestine and end of the [[small intestine]] ([[ileum]]).\n\nAlthough ulcerative colitis is a disease of unknown causation, inquiry should be made as to unusual factors believed to trigger the disease.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>\n\nThe [[simple clinical colitis activity index]] was created in 1998 and is used to assess the severity of symptoms.<ref name=\"WalmsleyAyres1998\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walmsley RS, Ayres RC, Pounder RE, Allan RN | title = A simple clinical colitis activity index | journal = Gut | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 29\u201332 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9771402 | pmc = 1727189 | doi = 10.1136/gut.43.1.29 }}</ref><!-- please retain this historical, non-MEDRS citation --><ref name=\"MardiniGrigorian2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mardini HE, Grigorian AY | title = Probiotic mix VSL#3 is effective adjunctive therapy for mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis: a meta-analysis | journal = Inflammatory Bowel Diseases | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1562\u20137 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24918321 | doi = 10.1097/MIB.0000000000000084 }}</ref>\n\n===Endoscopic===\n[[Image:Ulcerative colitis (2) endoscopic biopsy.jpg|thumb|Biopsy sample ([[H&E stain]]) that demonstrates marked [[lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] infiltration (blue/purple) of the [[intestinal mucosa]] and architectural distortion of the crypts.]]\nThe best test for diagnosis of ulcerative colitis remains [[endoscopy]].

The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing remission, which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the colon's lining, and then longer-term treatment to maintain remission and prevent complications.

In rare cases, the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon \u2013 although this does not necessarily resolve these symptoms.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>\n\nThe removal of the entire large intestine, know as a [[proctocolectomy]], results in a permanent ileostomy \u2013 where a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] is created by pulling the terminal ileum through the abdomen. Intestinal contents are emptied into a removable [[Ostomy pouching system|ostomy bag]] which is secured around the stoma using adhesive.\n\nAnother surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the [[ileo-anal pouch|ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA)]]. This is a two- or three-step procedure. In a three-step procedure, the first surgery is a [[Subtotal colectomy|sub-total colectomy]], in which the large bowel is removed, but the rectum remains in situ, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The second step is a [[proctecomy]] and formation of the ileal pouch (commonly known as a \"j-pouch\"). This involves removing the large majority of the remaining rectal stump and creating a new \"rectum\" by fashioning the end of the small intestine into a pouch and attaching it to the anus. After this procedure, a new type of ileostomy is created (known as a loop ileostomy) to allow the anastomoses to heal. The final surgery is a take-down procedure where the ileostomy is reversed and there is no longer the need for an ostomy bag. When done in two steps, a proctocolectomy \u2013 removing both the colon and rectum \u2013 is performed alongside the pouch formation and loop ileostomy. The final step is the same take-down surgery as in the three-step procedure. Time taken between each step can vary, but typically a six- to twelve-month interval is recommended between the first two steps, and a minimum of two to three months is required between the formation of the pouch and the ileostomy take-down.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile the ileal pouch procedure removes the need for an ostomy bag, it does not restore normal bowel function. In the months following the final operation, patients typically experience 8\u201315 bowel movements a day. Overtime this number decreases, with many patients reporting four-six bowel movements after one year post-op. While many patients have success with this procedure, there are a number of known complications. [[Pouchitis]], inflammation of the ileal pouch resulting in symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis, is relatively common. Pouchitis can be acute, remitting, or chronic however treatment using antibiotics, steroids, or biologics can be highly effective. Other complications include fistulas, abbesses, and pouch failure. Depending on the severity of the condition, pouch revision surgery may need to be performed. In some cased the pouch may need to be de-functioned or removed and an ileostomy recreated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colectomy Not a Final Cure for Ulcerative Colitis, Data Show |url=https://www.mdedge.com/internalmedicine/article/11622/gastroenterology/colectomy-not-final-cure-ulcerative-colitis-data |website=www.mdedge.com |accessdate=15 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pappou|first=Emmanouil P.|last2=Kiran|first2=Ravi P.|date=June 2016|title=The Failed J Pouch|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882179/|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123\u2013129|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1580724|issn=1531-0043|pmc=4882179|pmid=27247537}}</ref>\n\n=== Leukocyte apheresis ===\nA type of [[leukocyte apheresis]], known as granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis, still requires large-scale trials to determine whether or not it is effective.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abreu MT, Plevy S, Sands BE, Weinstein R | title = Selective leukocyte apheresis for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = 874\u201388 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18090155 | doi = 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3180479435 }}</ref> Results from small trials have been tentatively positive.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vernia P, D'Ovidio V, Meo D | title = Leukocytapheresis in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: Current position and perspectives | journal = Transfusion and Apheresis Science | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 227\u20139 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20817610 | doi = 10.1016/j.transci.2010.07.023 }}</ref>\n\n===Bacterial recolonization===\n* In a number of randomized clinical trials, [[probiotics]] have demonstrated the potential to be helpful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

People with UC may believe they are [[constipation|constipated]] when in fact they are experiencing [[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]], which is a constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel accompanied by involuntary straining efforts, pain, and cramping with little or no fecal output. Rectal pain is uncommon.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n*Moderate disease correlates with more than four stools daily, but with minimal signs of toxicity.

People in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to [[toxic megacolon]].

N-butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, gets oxidized through the [[beta oxidation]] pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It has been shown that N-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway.

In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis.{{mcn|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{Findings in CD vs. UC}}\n\n==Management==\n{{Main|Management of ulcerative colitis}}\nStandard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of involvement and disease severity. The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing remission, which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the colon's lining, and then longer-term treatment to maintain remission and prevent complications. Acute severe ulcerative colitis requires hospitalisation, exclusion of infections, and [[corticosteroids]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JH, Andrews JM, Kariyawasam V, Moran N, Gounder P, Collins G, Walsh AJ, Connor S, Lee TW, Koh CE, Chang J, Paramsothy S, Tattersall S, Lemberg DA, Radford-Smith G, Lawrance IC, McLachlan A, Moore GT, Corte C, Katelaris P, Leong RW | title = Review article: acute severe ulcerative colitis - evidence-based consensus statements | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 127\u201344 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27226344 | doi = 10.1111/apt.13670 }}</ref>\n\nFor acute stages of the disease, a [[Low-fiber/low-residue diet|low fiber diet]] may be recommended.<ref name=webmd>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/low-residue-diet-foods#2|title=Should You Try a Low-Residue Diet?|publisher=WebMD|website=WebMD|date=October 25, 2016|access-date=April 29, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316150550/http://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/low-residue-diet-foods#2|archive-date=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=manual_cnm>{{cite book|title=Manual of Clinical Nutrition Management|publisher=Compass Group|date=2013|url=http://bscn2k15.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/9/2/12924787/manual_of_clinical_nutrition2013.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129172958/http://bscn2k15.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/9/2/12924787/manual_of_clinical_nutrition2013.pdf|archive-date=29 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Medication===\nUlcerative colitis can be treated with a number of medications, including 5-ASA drugs such as [[sulfasalazine]] and [[mesalazine]].

Surgery is also indicated for people with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. People with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nUlcerative colitis affects many parts of the body outside the intestinal tract. In rare cases, the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon \u2013 although this does not necessarily resolve these symptoms.<ref name=ACGGuideline/>\n\nThe removal of the entire large intestine, know as a [[proctocolectomy]], results in a permanent ileostomy \u2013 where a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] is created by pulling the terminal ileum through the abdomen. Intestinal contents are emptied into a removable [[Ostomy pouching system|ostomy bag]] which is secured around the stoma using adhesive.\n\nAnother surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the [[ileo-anal pouch|ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA)]]. This is a two- or three-step procedure. In a three-step procedure, the first surgery is a [[Subtotal colectomy|sub-total colectomy]], in which the large bowel is removed, but the rectum remains in situ, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The second step is a [[proctecomy]] and formation of the ileal pouch (commonly known as a \"j-pouch\"). This involves removing the large majority of the remaining rectal stump and creating a new \"rectum\" by fashioning the end of the small intestine into a pouch and attaching it to the anus. After this procedure, a new type of ileostomy is created (known as a loop ileostomy) to allow the anastomoses to heal. The final surgery is a take-down procedure where the ileostomy is reversed and there is no longer the need for an ostomy bag. When done in two steps, a proctocolectomy \u2013 removing both the colon and rectum \u2013 is performed alongside the pouch formation and loop ileostomy. The final step is the same take-down surgery as in the three-step procedure. Time taken between each step can vary, but typically a six- to twelve-month interval is recommended between the first two steps, and a minimum of two to three months is required between the formation of the pouch and the ileostomy take-down.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile the ileal pouch procedure removes the need for an ostomy bag, it does not restore normal bowel function. In the months following the final operation, patients typically experience 8-15 bowel movements a day. Overtime this number decreases, with many patients reporting four-six bowel movements after one year post-op. While many patients have success with this procedure, there are a number of known complications. [[Pouchitis]], inflammation of the ileal pouch resulting in symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis, is relatively common. Pouchitis can be acute, remitting, or chronic however treatment using antibiotics, steroids, or biologics can be highly effective. Other complications include fistulas, abbesses, and pouch failure. Depending on the severity of the condition, pouch revision surgery may need to be performed. In some cased the pouch may need to be de-functioned or removed and an ileostomy recreated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colectomy Not a Final Cure for Ulcerative Colitis, Data Show |url=https://www.mdedge.com/internalmedicine/article/11622/gastroenterology/colectomy-not-final-cure-ulcerative-colitis-data |website=www.mdedge.com |accessdate=15 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pappou|first=Emmanouil P.|last2=Kiran|first2=Ravi P.|date=June 2016|title=The Failed J Pouch|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882179/|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123\u2013129|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1580724|issn=1531-0043|pmc=4882179|pmid=27247537}}</ref>\n\n=== Leukocyte apheresis ===\nA type of [[leukocyte apheresis]], known as granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis, still requires large-scale trials to determine whether or not it is effective.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Abreu MT, Plevy S, Sands BE, Weinstein R | title = Selective leukocyte apheresis for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = 874\u201388 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18090155 | doi = 10.1097/MCG.0b013e3180479435 }}</ref> Results from small trials have been tentatively positive.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vernia P, D'Ovidio V, Meo D | title = Leukocytapheresis in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: Current position and perspectives | journal = Transfusion and Apheresis Science | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 227\u20139 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20817610 | doi = 10.1016/j.transci.2010.07.023 }}</ref>\n\n===Bacterial recolonization===\n* In a number of randomized clinical trials, [[probiotics]] have demonstrated the potential to be helpful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

His son [[Mario Van Peebles]] also appears in a small role, playing the title character as a young boy. It tells the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] story of the flight of a poor black man from the [[White American|white]] police authorities.\n\nVan Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three-picture contract for [[Columbia Pictures]]. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded it himself, shooting it independently over 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, some reportedly [[unsimulated sex|unsimulated]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=J.|title=Videodrome: Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)|url=http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2014/01/29/videodrome-sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971/|website=Aquarium Drunkard|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> He received a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed reviews. However, it has left a lasting impression on African-American cinema.\n\nThe musical score of ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' was performed by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Van Peebles did not have money for traditional advertising methods, so released the [[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened in only two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $15.2 million at the box office. [[Huey P. Newton]] celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and ''Sweetback'' became required viewing for members of the [[Black Panther Party]]. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it demonstrated to [[Hollywood film industry|Hollywood]] that films which portrayed \"militant\" blacks could be highly profitable, leading to the creation of the [[blaxploitation]] genre,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jutton |first1=Lee |title=SWEET SWEETBACK\u2019S BAADASSSSS SONG: A Blaxploitation Classic That Remains All Too Relevant Today |url=https://www.filminquiry.com/sweet-sweetbacks-baadasssss-song-1971-review/ |website=www.filminquiry.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> although critic [[Roger Ebert]], commenting on a review of the 2004 film about the making of this movie, did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040611/REVIEWS/406110302 |title=Review of ''Baadasssss!'' |accessdate=2007-01-04 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=June 11, 2004 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young African-American orphan ([[Mario Van Peebles]]) is given shelter by the proprietor of a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] brothel in the 1940s. While working there as a young towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback works in the whorehouse by performing in a [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback in order to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by the police on the orders of the police commissioner, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station. He next visits an old girlfriend (Rhetta Hughes), who similarly refuses him aid but agrees to cut his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks for help from his [[priest]], but he, too, refuses for fear of the police shutting down the [[drug rehab]] center he runs out of the church's attic.\n\nTwo police officers threaten Beetle in an attempt to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun next to each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the city outskirts, in the direction of the [[United States\u2013Mexico border]]. Stopping for the night at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover that it is a [[safe house]] for a chapter of the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to have won. Afterwards, the bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. In the middle of the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon ([[John Amos]]) arrives, but only has room on his motorcycle for one passenger; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu instead of him, as the activist Mu-Mu is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continues to evade arrest, public pressure mounts on the police; the police commissioner warns his staff that failure to catch them could result in an uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be one of the fugitives. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is somone else.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving the police who then send a helicopter in pursuit of the hippie through the desert. The police find Sweetback's biological mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy. As Sweetback approaches the border, the police become desperate, and force a farmer to lend them his hunting dogs. The chase concludes in the [[Tijuana River]], where Sweetback kills two of the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' DVD, [[Xenon Entertainment Group]], 2003. {{ISBN|978-1-57829-750-4}}</ref> Because no studio would finance the film, Van Peebles put his own money into the production, and shot it independently. Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by [[Bill Cosby]] to complete the film. \"Cosby didn't want an equity part,\" according to Van Peebles. \"He just wanted his money back.\" Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\">{{cite book |last=Van Peebles |first=Melvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Kaufman, Alan |editor2=Ortenberg, Neil |editor3=Rosset, Barney |others= |title=The Outlaw Bible of American Literature |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-56025-550-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 286\u2013289] |chapter=''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles wanted \"a victorious film ... where [[nigger]]s could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other's eyes, looking once again like they'd had it.\" Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that \"[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film \"simply couldn't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is\" and that \"to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains\". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would \"be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew \"to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.\" Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected \"a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking\", thus he had to \"write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThe film's fast-paced [[Montage sequence|montage]]s and [[jump cut]]s were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the film's editing had \"a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=FILM VIEW; Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited\n|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1995|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/movies/film-view-sweet-sweetback-s-world-revisited.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> In ''The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity'', author S. Torriano Berry writes that the film's \"odd camera angles, superimpositions, reverse-key effects, box and matting effects, rack-focus shots, extreme zooms, stop-motion and step-printing, and an abundance of jittery handheld camera work all helped to express the paranoid nightmare that [Sweetback's] life had become.\"<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cIJR0JF6PFoC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=odd+camera+angles,+superimpositions,+reverse-key+effects | title = The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity | isbn = 978-0-8065-2133-6 | author1 = Torriano Berry | first2 = Venise T. | last2 = Berry | year = 2001}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)}}\nSince Van Peebles did not have the money to hire a composer, he composed the film's music score himself. Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension.

We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom.

While working there as a young towel boy, he is raped by one of the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]. The women name him \"Sweet Sweetback\" in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis. As an adult, Sweetback works in the whorehouse by performing in a [[sex show]].\n\nOne night, two white [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback in order to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\n\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by the police on the orders of the police commissioner, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a [[molotov cocktail]] at the police car transporting him to the station. He next visits an old girlfriend (Rhetta Hughes), who similarly refuses him aid but agrees to cut his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks for help from his [[priest]], but he, too, refuses for fear of the police shutting down the [[drug rehab]] center he runs out of the church's attic.\n\nTwo police officers threaten Beetle in an attempt to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun next to each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through [[South Central Los Angeles]] to the city outskirts, in the direction of the [[United States\u2013Mexico border]]. Stopping for the night at a seemingly abandoned building, they discover that it is a [[safe house]] for a chapter of the [[Hells Angels]]. Their helmetted president challenges Sweetback to a duel: asked to decide the weapon and discovering she is a woman, he chooses sex and is judged to have won. Afterwards, the bikers leave the men in their club to await a member of the all black [[East Bay Dragons MC|East Bay Dragons]] who will get them to Mexico. In the middle of the night, the club is raided by two policemen with drawn guns. Sweetback resists arrest and kills both officers in self-defense, but Mu-Mu is badly wounded. The next morning, the Dragon ([[John Amos]]) arrives, but only has room on his motorcycle for one passenger; Sweetback asks him to take Mu-Mu instead of him, as the activist Mu-Mu is their future.\n\nAs Sweetback and Mu-Mu continues to evade arrest, public pressure mounts on the police; the police commissioner warns his staff that failure to catch them could result in an uprising. The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be one of the fugitives. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback; he mocks the officers when it turns out to be someone else.\n\nSweetback pays a [[hippie]] to switch clothes with him, deceiving the police who then send a helicopter in pursuit of the hippie through the desert. The police find Sweetback's biological mother, who reveals that his birth name is Leroy. As Sweetback approaches the border, the police become desperate, and force a farmer to lend them his hunting dogs. The chase concludes in the [[Tijuana River]], where Sweetback kills two of the dogs and escapes into Mexico, swearing to return to \"collect some dues\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Sweetback\n* Hubert Scales as Mu-Mu\n* Simon Chuckster as Beetle\n* John Dullaghan as Commissioner\n* West Gale\n* Niva Rochelle\n* [[Rhetta Hughes]] as Old Girl Friend\n* Nick Ferrari\n* Ed Rue\n* [[John Amos]] as Biker (as Johnny Amos)\n* Lavelle Roby\n* Ted Hayden\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Young Sweetback / Kid (as Mario Peebles)\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nDuring production on ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]], Van Peebles attempted to rewrite the script in order to change it from a comedy poking fun of white liberals into the first [[black power]] film. The writer, [[Herman Raucher]], who had based the script on friends of his who expressed liberal sentiments while still holding onto bigoted beliefs, objected to Van Peebles' efforts because he felt that the movie should be a parody of liberal culture.<ref>[http://www.cinedump.com/interviews/2016/9/13/hermanraucher Fassel, Preston. ''Rediscovering Herman Raucher.'' Retrieved 10 February 2017]</ref> Raucher ultimately exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to novelize his own script, effectively preventing Peebles from too radically changing the film.\n\nAfter ''Watermelon Man'' proved to be a financial success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song''. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the [[Mojave desert]], turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and squatted down facing the sun.  He decided that the film was going to be \"about a brother getting [[the Man]]'s foot out of his ass.\"<ref name=\"DariusJames\">{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink=Darius James |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-312-13192-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">Van Peebles, Melvin.

Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nAccording to Van Peebles, during the first day of shooting, director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights, because he believed the results would not appear well on film. Van Peebles told him to do it anyway. When he saw the [[Dailies|rushes]], Maxwell was overjoyed, and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot. Van Peebles shot the film over a relatively short period of 19 days in order to reduce the possibility of the cast, most of whom were amateurs, showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day. He shot the film in what he referred to as \"globs,\" where he would shoot entire sequences at a time. Because Van Peebles couldn't afford a [[Stunt performer|stunt man]], he performed all of the stunts himself, which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes. At one point in the shoot, Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge. Bob Maxwell later stated, \"Well, that's great, Mel, but let's do it again.\" Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times. Van Peebles contracted [[gonorrhea]] when filming one of the many sex scenes, and successfully applied to the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] in order to get [[workers' compensation]] because he was \"hurt on the job.\" Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=2 What Culture#17]; Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</ref>\n\nVan Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to stay until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crew members were standing there with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nVan Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire, but had done so on a Friday; as a result, there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene. When the scene was shot, a fire truck showed up. This ended up in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Directing===\nVan Peebles stated that he approached directing the film \"like you do the cupboard when you're broke and hungry: throw in everything eatable and hope to come out on top with the seasoning, i.e., by editing.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" /> Van Peebles stated that \"story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. ... To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\">{{cite book |last=Van Peebles |first=Melvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Kaufman, Alan |editor2=Ortenberg, Neil |editor3=Rosset, Barney |others= |title=The Outlaw Bible of American Literature |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-56025-550-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outlawbibleofame0000unse/page/286 286\u2013289] |chapter=''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles wanted \"a victorious film ... where [[nigger]]s could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other's eyes, looking once again like they'd had it.\" Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low-budget independently made features, and was determined to make a film that \"[looked] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles knew that in order to spread his message, the film \"simply couldn't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing ... to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is\" and that \"to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains\". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would \"be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product ... [The Man] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nVan Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew \"to be third world people. ... So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced. ... Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted.\" Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected \"a great deal of animosity from the film media (white in the first place and right wing in the second) at all levels of filmmaking\", thus he had to \"write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted. In short, stay loose.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\n===Editing===\nThe film's fast-paced [[Montage sequence|montage]]s and [[jump cut]]s were novel features for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the film's editing had \"a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title=FILM VIEW; Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited\n|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1995|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/movies/film-view-sweet-sweetback-s-world-revisited.html|accessdate=January 11, 2012|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref> In ''The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity'', author S. Torriano Berry writes that the film's \"odd camera angles, superimpositions, reverse-key effects, box and matting effects, rack-focus shots, extreme zooms, stop-motion and step-printing, and an abundance of jittery handheld camera work all helped to express the paranoid nightmare that [Sweetback's] life had become.\"<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cIJR0JF6PFoC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=odd+camera+angles,+superimpositions,+reverse-key+effects | title = The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity | isbn = 978-0-8065-2133-6 | author1 = Torriano Berry | first2 = Venise T. | last2 = Berry | year = 2001}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)}}\nSince Van Peebles did not have the money to hire a composer, he composed the film's music score himself. Because he did not know how to read or write music, he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Van Peebles stated that \"Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations. Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension. So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film.\"<ref name=\"OutlawBible\" />\n\nThe film's music was performed by the then-unknown group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> By alternating [[hymn]]-based vocalization and [[jazz]] rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Kermit Ernest |title=Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation |year=2005 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2925-2 |page=43 |chapter=Professing the Power of the Rap }}</ref>\n\nVan Peebles recalls that \"music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album.\" Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a [[soundtrack album]] in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.<ref name=\"Funk\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Funk |origyear= |month= |url=https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-87930-629-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funk00thom/page/207 207\u2013208] |chapter=Blaxploitation: Funk Goes to the Movies |chapterurl= |quote= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Release and alterations==\nThe film was released on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that \"at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in [[Detroit]], and one in [[Atlanta]]. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only on the strength of the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet. By the second day, people would take their lunch and sit through it three times. I knew that I was finally talking to my audience.

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an [[exploitation film]].<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' critic Clayton Riley viewed the film favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he \"is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic [[colonialism]].\" In another review, Riley explained that \"Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does.\" Critic [[Donald Bogle]] states in a ''New York Times'' interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, [[Sidney Poitier]]-type characters and that they wanted a \"viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero.\"<ref name=\"FramingBlackness\" /> In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: \"Not since [[Oscar Micheaux]] had an African-American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment...[it] depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other.\"<ref name=\"moma\">Higgins, Steven.

Print. p. 254</ref>\n\nNicky Baxter of Metroactive response is mixed: ''Sweet Sweetback'' introduced the biggest and baddest buck of the [blaxploitation era]. Warts and all, the film is perhaps the closest analogy to the progressive aims of the then-flourishing Black Arts movement. Indeed, it can be argued that because it was written, produced and directed by an American-born African outside of Hollywood, the film is not truly part of the blaxploitation genre, yet it cannot be denied that it shares certain thematic similarities. The film works best when it follows Sweetback's odyssey from stud boy to proto-nationalist consciousness. Unlike the Horatio Alger-style integrationism propagated in past films about blacks, here we see an outlaw among outlaws, nourished by a community segregated from the mainstream. It is in this disenfranchised community--and not the sterile offices of the NAACP--that he seeks and finds refuge. The sordid sexual trysts, the faux fantasies in the desert are, finally, less interesting than Sweetback's quest for self-realization.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=Nicky |title=In the early '70s, blaxploitation upended Hollywood stereotypes |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/blax-9545.html |website=www.metroactive.com |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Notable reactions===\n[[Huey P.

Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that \"some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes.\" Bennett concluded that the film is \"neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation.\" Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the \"rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute.\" Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as \"emancipation orgasms\" and stated that \"it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set you free.

Located {{convert|25|mi|km}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh]], it is part of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]].  The population was 3,657 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nLike many places around Pittsburgh, Rochester was a former industrial hub, home to the H. C. Fry Glass Company, and was a major junction on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Recently, Rochester has been a background for films, including the 1986 movie ''[[Gung Ho (film)|Gung Ho]]'', the 1996 movie ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', and the 2000 movie ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Fry Glass Factory c 1910.gif|thumb|left|H. C. Fry Glass Factory, c. 1910]]\nWhat would eventually become Rochester was originally a [[Lenape]] village called [[Sawcunk]] before being settled in 1799 in what was then the [[American frontier]] by white settlers. During this time, what would eventually become Rochester was known as East [[Bridgewater, Pennsylvania|Bridgewater]], Fairport, and Beaver Point. The borough adopted its current name in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in Pittsburgh decided to christen his home with the name Rochester so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in 1849.<ref name=\"History\">[http://m.timesonline.com/columnists/jeffrey_snedden/the-hub-rochester-s-formative-days-were-once-part-of/article_0f3db55e-2971-11e5-ae2f-0fd2e71c2598.html?mode=jqm The Hub: Rochester\u2019s formative days were once part of East Bridgewater] ''[[The Beaver County Times]]'' (07/14/2015)</ref>\n\nMany of the streets that run through Rochester today had different names based on wild animals. Virginia Avenue and Adams Street\u2014two of the city's main thoroughfares via [[Pennsylvania Route 68]]\u2014were once known as Fox Lane and Tiger Lane, respectively. Deer Lane, which still exists today, is the last remnant of the original naming scheme for the street grid in the borough.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nRochester is where [[Henry Clay Fry]] and his associates formed a glass manufacturing company following Fry's return from the [[American Civil War]]. In 1897 the Rochester Tumbler Company (as the company was known) became the National Glass Company of Rochester.<ref name=\"fry\">{{cite web|url= http://www.myantiquemall.com/AQstories/fry/Fry.html|title= HC Fry Glass Co.|accessdate= 2008-08-31}}</ref><ref name=\"fry2\">{{cite web|url= http://ndga.net/advertising/advfry.htm|title= H.

Located {{convert|25|mi|km}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh]], it is part of the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]].  The population was 3,657 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nLike many places around Pittsburgh, Rochester was a former industrial hub, home to the H. C. Fry Glass Company, and was a major junction on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Recently, Rochester has been a background for films, including the 1986 movie ''[[Gung Ho (film)|Gung Ho]]'', the 1996 movie ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', and the 2000 movie ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Fry Glass Factory c 1910.gif|thumb|left|H. C. Fry Glass Factory, c. 1910]]\nWhat would eventually become Rochester was originally a [[Lenape]] village called [[Sawcunk]] before being settled in 1799 in what was then the [[American frontier]] by white settlers. During this time, what would eventually become Rochester was known as East [[Bridgewater, Pennsylvania|Bridgewater]], Fairport, and Beaver Point. The borough adopted its current name in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in Pittsburgh decided to christen his home with the name Rochester so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in 1849.<ref name=\"History\">[http://m.timesonline.com/columnists/jeffrey_snedden/the-hub-rochester-s-formative-days-were-once-part-of/article_0f3db55e-2971-11e5-ae2f-0fd2e71c2598.html?mode=jqm The Hub: Rochester\u2019s formative days were once part of East Bridgewater] ''[[The Beaver County Times]]'' (07/14/2015)</ref>\n\nMany of the streets that run through Rochester today had different names based on wild animals. Virginia Avenue and Adams Street\u2014two of the city's main thoroughfares via [[Pennsylvania Route 68]]\u2014were once known as Fox Lane and Tiger Lane, respectively. Deer Lane, which still exists today, is the last remnant of the original naming scheme for the street grid in the borough.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nRochester is where [[Henry Clay Fry]] and his associates formed a glass manufacturing company following Fry's return from the [[American Civil War]]. In 1897 the Rochester Tumbler Company (as the company was known) became the National Glass Company of Rochester.<ref name=\"fry\">{{cite web|url= http://www.myantiquemall.com/AQstories/fry/Fry.html|title= HC Fry Glass Co.|accessdate= 2008-08-31}}</ref><ref name=\"fry2\">{{cite web|url= http://ndga.net/advertising/advfry.htm|title= H.
