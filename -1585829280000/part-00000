With an Erector Set he can satisfy this inclination and gain mental development without apparent effort. ... He will learn the fundamentals of engineering.\" However, late-century marketing relied less on explicit sexism and more on implicit gender cues, such as color, and new fantasy-based gender roles like the beautiful princess or the muscle-bound action hero.

Since almost four decades ago, women have been expected to conform to a particular body image and to behave in a certain manner of which would ultimately decipher and enforce their femininity (Bordo, 1997, p.&nbsp;94).<ref>{{cite book|author=Bordo, Susan|title=Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.|url=https://archive.org/details/twilightzoneshid0000bord|url-access=registration|location=Berkeley|publisher=U of California P|year=1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/twilightzoneshid0000bord/page/94 94]}}</ref> Both men and women strive to achieve this beauty which influences them to shape themselves and alter their appearance in order to conform to those norms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cregan|first=Kate|title=Key Concepts in Body and Society|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|pages=16}}</ref> These norms are largely derived from the media's presentation of models and well known stars through advertisements for products and magazine covers. As our society is now filled with these advertisements in all aspects of life, such as on TV, billboards, in supermarkets displayed with the products (particularly beauty products) and on social media, children are now viewing this material at a younger age and in turn creating the perception that this is the ideal appearance whilst they are still very impressionable.

The use of these images creates a false beauty ideal for both men and women to aspire to, as well as creating the use of extreme dieting and surgical procedures in order to resemble a similar image that is displayed in advertising. This emphasis on an ideal body appearance has been regarded as being psychologically detrimental to the well-being of many young men and women, and on their self-image.

The message may be that \"innocence is sexy\", that women enjoy being dominated, that the use of a certain product is naughty but legal, or that use of a certain product will make the user more attractive to the opposite sex, and many other messages. The way beauty is portrayed in the media causes dissatisfaction and negative thoughts about oneself when those results are not achieved. Sociocultural standards of male images are presented in almost all forms of popular media, barraging men with images that portray what is considered to be the \"ideal body\". Such standards of beauty are almost completely unattainable for most men; a majority of the models displayed on television and in advertisements are well below what is considered healthy body weight. Mass media's use of such unrealistic models sends an implicit message that in order for a man to be considered beautiful, he must be unhealthy. The mindset that a person can never be \"too rich or too thin\" is all too prevalent in society, and it makes it difficult for males to achieve any level of contentment with their physical appearance. There has been a plethora of research to indicate that men are negatively affected by constant exposure to models that fulfill the unrealistic media ideal of beauty.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Myriad: Westminster's Interactive Academic Journal|url = http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&detail=4475&content=4795|website = www.westminstercollege.edu|access-date = 2016-02-08|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&detail=4475&content=4795|archivedate = 2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, from the minute boys enter the classroom, masculine identity building is taking place in one form or another.

William Pollack (as cited in Neu & Weinfeld, 2007) calls this set of culturally embedded expectations about masculinity the Boy Code.

Therefore, they create cognitive schemes, which are certain representations of the reality displaying its most typical and fundamental elements and properties. These schemes are responsible for defining the essence of our worldview and have a significant influence on social cognition \u2013 understanding, anticipation, situation and emotion control.\n\nGender roles have also been impacted by the media and advertising. [[SlutWalk]] is one phenomenon that emerges through incontemporary \"third-wave feminism\". The SlutWalk movement helps increase victim visibility and reintroduce sexual violence issues to the public.<ref>Sorce, G. (2016). SlutWalk: Feminism, Activism and Media.

A division of gender roles is deeply rooted in today's society. Through the ages men have been considered to be financial providers, career-focused, assertive and independent, whereas women have been shown as low-position workers, loving wives and mothers, responsible for raising children and doing housework. Nowadays a family model is based rather on a partnership than on patriarchy and women have more rights and possibilities on the labor market. Feminist environment had a significant impact on the change in this situation. [[Women's liberation movement]] fought for the rights of women and for redefining traditional gender roles. Although females and males are still not equal, the differences between gender are not so vast anymore. Nevertheless, many social institutions, such as mass media, still use gender stereotypes, based on the assumption that they are well known to everyone and help the receivers to understand the content of the message.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://krytyka.org/gender-stereotypes-in-mass-media-case-study-analysis-of-the-gender-stereotyping-phenomenon-in-tv-commercials/|title=Gender stereotypes in mass media.

Advertising frequently uses gender roles to promote products. There are various stereotypes in regards to humorous advertising with both males and females. Stereotypes can product oversimplified conceptions and misapplied knowledge evaluations. Humor is generated on two steps. First, some kind of incongruity that violates a predominating view has to be recognized and, second, if people cognitively resolve this incongruity, they experience humor. Humor occurs when it seems that things are normal, while at the same time something goes wrong that breaks our expectations. Men could be depicted in domestic roles doing chores, whereas women would be presented in independent roles. This would break our expectation and society norms that revolve around the gender roles. Exaggerating these gender norms would have a potential to be humorous.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eisend | first1 = M. | last2 = Plagemann | first2 = J. | last3 = Sollwedel | first3 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Gender Roles and Humor in Advertising: The Occurrence of Stereotyping in Humorous and Nonhumorous Advertising and Its Consequences for Advertising Effectiveness | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 256\u2013273 | doi = 10.1080/00913367.2013.857621 }}</ref>\n\n== Advertising strategy ==\nMedia and advertising has also taken a strategic role in today's society. Women's behavioral intention is enhanced more through a transformation message strategy than an information message strategy. However, a man's behavioral intention is an information message strategy as opposed to a behavioral intention.<ref name=\"Yoon-Joo, L. 2010\">Yoon-Joo, L., Haley, E., & Avery, E. J. (2010). The Role of Gender and Message Strategy in the Perception of Advocacy Advertising. Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising (CTC Press), 32(1), 47-55.</ref> Advertisements rarely portray people that look like \"us\", or the norm.

Another gender difference that has emerged is consumer effectiveness and message strategy significantly predicted self-efficacy. These findings show a gender role within media and advertising.<ref name=\"Yoon-Joo, L. 2010\" />\n\nResearch suggests that there are four different and independent components. They are trait descriptors (self-assertion, concern for others), physical characteristics (hair length, body height), role behaviors (leader, taking care of children), and occupational status (truck driver, elementary school teacher, housewife). Each component has a masculine and a feminine version. Stereotyping becomes problematic when stereotypes lead to expectations and judgements that restrict life opportunities for subject of a social category. This is the reason why public policy is concerned about marketing activities that promote stereotypes. Each gender stereotype component can lead to negative consequences that restrict life opportunities, particularly for women. Physical characteristics can lead to reduced self-dignity, role behaviors may lead to restricted opportunities of self-development, and stereotyping of occupational roles may lead to disadvantages in women's careers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gender roles in advertising|date=2011|journal=International Journal of Advertising|volume=30|issue=5|pages=867\u2013888|doi=10.2501/IJA-30-5-867-888|author= Knoll, S.|author2=Eisend, M.|author3=Steinhagen, J.|lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Criticism of advertising]]\n* [[Effects of advertising on teen body image]]\n* [[Exploitation of women in mass media]]\n* ''[[Killing Us Softly]]''\n* [[Media and gender]]\n* [[Sex in advertising]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n=== Classic advertisements ===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBCyPdEIdOA%20 Lee Marvin \u2013 Pall Mall commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spb0bo3IT0I 1960s Xerox commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRYfouuHPvs 1960s Folgers coffee commercial]\n\n=== Modern advertisements ===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9tWZB7OUSU AXE body-spray commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGDVY_jyfDM Aqua di Gioia commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLTIowBF0kE Old Spice commercial]\n\n[[Category:Advertising]]\n[[Category:Gender roles]]\n[[Category:Communication]]\n[[Category:Sexual attraction]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{editorial|date=May 2015}}\n{{disputed|date=December 2014}}\n{{too few opinions|date=December 2014}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2016}}\n}}\n'''Gender advertisement''' refers to the '''images''' in [[advertising]] that depict [[stereotypical]] [[gender roles]] and displays.

With an Erector Set he can satisfy this inclination and gain mental development without apparent effort. ... He will learn the fundamentals of engineering.\" However, late-century marketing relied less on explicit sexism and more on implicit gender cues, such as color, and new fantasy-based gender roles like the beautiful princess or the muscle-bound action hero.

This is an indicator that there is in fact a distinction between the genders in advertising.<ref name=\"MediaEd\" />\n\n== Effects of advertisements ==\nBeauty can be defined largely as a perception. It is a group of social norms that interpret a particular form of appearance that is valued. Since almost four decades ago, women have been expected to conform to a particular body image and to behave in a certain manner of which would ultimately decipher and enforce their femininity (Bordo, 1997, p.&nbsp;94).<ref>{{cite book|author=Bordo, Susan|title=Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.|url=https://archive.org/details/twilightzoneshid0000bord|url-access=registration|location=Berkeley|publisher=U of California P|year=1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/twilightzoneshid0000bord/page/94 94]}}</ref> Both men and women strive to achieve this beauty which influences them to shape themselves and alter their appearance in order to conform to those norms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cregan|first=Kate|title=Key Concepts in Body and Society|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|pages=16}}</ref> These norms are largely derived from the media's presentation of models and well known stars through advertisements for products and magazine covers. As our society is now filled with these advertisements in all aspects of life, such as on TV, billboards, in supermarkets displayed with the products (particularly beauty products) and on social media, children are now viewing this material at a younger age and in turn creating the perception that this is the ideal appearance whilst they are still very impressionable. Young children learn by observing and imitating what is presented to them.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Bakir, A.|author2=Palan, K.|year=2010|title=How are Children's Attitudes Toward Ads and Brands Affected by Gender-Related Content in Advertising?|doi=10.2753/JOA0091-3367390103|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=39|issue=1|pages=35\u201348}}</ref>\n\nIn the early twentieth century, society began to pursue material goods with the goal of fulfilling a general desire to own the item rather than for later use.<ref>{{cite book|last=Howson|first=Alexandra|title=The body in consumer culture|date=2004|pages=94\u201395}}</ref> This is largely due to the use of advertising media and the perception, particularly with beauty products, that the models pictured obtain their looks buy using these products.\n\nIt is very common for young men and women to compare themselves to models in ads, in terms of their physical attractiveness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Mary|author2=James Gentry|title=Stuck in the Model Trap: The Effects of Beautiful Models in Ads on Female Pre-Adolescents and Adolescents|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=1997|pages=19}}</ref> The appearance and body size of the models within the advertisements in the final image seen by consumers are, more often than not, altered through editing programs such as Photoshop, in order to achieve the perfect (or impossible) desired look.  The use of these images creates a false beauty ideal for both men and women to aspire to, as well as creating the use of extreme dieting and surgical procedures in order to resemble a similar image that is displayed in advertising. This emphasis on an ideal body appearance has been regarded as being psychologically detrimental to the well-being of many young men and women, and on their self-image. The extant research shows that stereotypes can be helpful or detrimental, depending on several factors, such as the gender attitudes of the audience.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Gender Roles and Humor in Advertising: The Occurrence of Stereotyping in Humorous and Nonhumorous Advertising and Its Consequences for Advertising Effectiveness|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=43|issue=3|pages=256\u2013273|doi=10.1080/00913367.2013.857621|year=2014|last1=Eisend|first1=Martin|last2=Plagemann|first2=Julia|last3=Sollwedel|first3=Julia}}</ref>\n\nMagazine advertisements highlighting a thin, attractive female model yield greater self-objectification and the process of inspecting this type of advertisement can encourage women to think about their physical appearance as if looking on as a critical observer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harper |last2= Tiggemann|first1=Brit |first2= Marika|title=The Effect of Thin Ideal Media Images on Women's Self-Objectification, Mood, and Body Image|journal=Sex Roles|date=2008|pages=649\u2013657|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9379-x|volume=58|issue= 9\u201310}}</ref> Images from the media are frequently exposed to Western women, and the usage of skinny idealized women in advertising is prevalent.

The message may be that \"innocence is sexy\", that women enjoy being dominated, that the use of a certain product is naughty but legal, or that use of a certain product will make the user more attractive to the opposite sex, and many other messages. The way beauty is portrayed in the media causes dissatisfaction and negative thoughts about oneself when those results are not achieved. Sociocultural standards of male images are presented in almost all forms of popular media, barraging men with images that portray what is considered to be the \"ideal body\". Such standards of beauty are almost completely unattainable for most men; a majority of the models displayed on television and in advertisements are well below what is considered healthy body weight. Mass media's use of such unrealistic models sends an implicit message that in order for a man to be considered beautiful, he must be unhealthy. The mindset that a person can never be \"too rich or too thin\" is all too prevalent in society, and it makes it difficult for males to achieve any level of contentment with their physical appearance. There has been a plethora of research to indicate that men are negatively affected by constant exposure to models that fulfill the unrealistic media ideal of beauty.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Myriad: Westminster's Interactive Academic Journal|url = http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&detail=4475&content=4795|website = www.westminstercollege.edu|access-date = 2016-02-08|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&detail=4475&content=4795|archivedate = 2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, from the minute boys enter the classroom, masculine identity building is taking place in one form or another.

A division of gender roles is deeply rooted in today's society. Through the ages men have been considered to be financial providers, career-focused, assertive and independent, whereas women have been shown as low-position workers, loving wives and mothers, responsible for raising children and doing housework. Nowadays a family model is based rather on a partnership than on patriarchy and women have more rights and possibilities on the labor market. Feminist environment had a significant impact on the change in this situation. [[Women's liberation movement]] fought for the rights of women and for redefining traditional gender roles. Although females and males are still not equal, the differences between gender are not so vast anymore. Nevertheless, many social institutions, such as mass media, still use gender stereotypes, based on the assumption that they are well known to everyone and help the receivers to understand the content of the message.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://krytyka.org/gender-stereotypes-in-mass-media-case-study-analysis-of-the-gender-stereotyping-phenomenon-in-tv-commercials/|title=Gender stereotypes in mass media.

Advertising frequently uses gender roles to promote products. There are various stereotypes in regards to humorous advertising with both males and females. Stereotypes can product oversimplified conceptions and misapplied knowledge evaluations. Humor is generated on two steps. First, some kind of incongruity that violates a predominating view has to be recognized and, second, if people cognitively resolve this incongruity, they experience humor. Humor occurs when it seems that things are normal, while at the same time something goes wrong that breaks our expectations. Men could be depicted in domestic roles doing chores, whereas women would be presented in independent roles. This would break our expectation and society norms that revolve around the gender roles. Exaggerating these gender norms would have a potential to be humorous.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eisend | first1 = M. | last2 = Plagemann | first2 = J. | last3 = Sollwedel | first3 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Gender Roles and Humor in Advertising: The Occurrence of Stereotyping in Humorous and Nonhumorous Advertising and Its Consequences for Advertising Effectiveness | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 256\u2013273 | doi = 10.1080/00913367.2013.857621 }}</ref>\n\n== Advertising strategy ==\nMedia and advertising has also taken a strategic role in today's society.

Another gender difference that has emerged is consumer effectiveness and message strategy significantly predicted self-efficacy. These findings show a gender role within media and advertising.<ref name=\"Yoon-Joo, L. 2010\" />\n\nResearch suggests that there are four different and independent components. They are trait descriptors (self-assertion, concern for others), physical characteristics (hair length, body height), role behaviors (leader, taking care of children), and occupational status (truck driver, elementary school teacher, housewife). Each component has a masculine and a feminine version. Stereotyping becomes problematic when stereotypes lead to expectations and judgements that restrict life opportunities for subject of a social category. This is the reason why public policy is concerned about marketing activities that promote stereotypes. Each gender stereotype component can lead to negative consequences that restrict life opportunities, particularly for women. Physical characteristics can lead to reduced self-dignity, role behaviors may lead to restricted opportunities of self-development, and stereotyping of occupational roles may lead to disadvantages in women's careers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gender roles in advertising|date=2011|journal=International Journal of Advertising|volume=30|issue=5|pages=867\u2013888|doi=10.2501/IJA-30-5-867-888|author= Knoll, S.|author2=Eisend, M.|author3=Steinhagen, J.|lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Criticism of advertising]]\n* [[Effects of advertising on teen body image]]\n* [[Exploitation of women in mass media]]\n* ''[[Killing Us Softly]]''\n* [[Media and gender]]\n* [[Sex in advertising]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n=== Classic advertisements ===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBCyPdEIdOA%20 Lee Marvin \u2013 Pall Mall commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spb0bo3IT0I 1960s Xerox commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRYfouuHPvs 1960s Folgers coffee commercial]\n\n=== Modern advertisements ===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9tWZB7OUSU AXE body-spray commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGDVY_jyfDM Aqua di Gioia commercial]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLTIowBF0kE Old Spice commercial]\n\n[[Category:Advertising]]\n[[Category:Gender roles]]\n[[Category:Communication]]\n[[Category:Sexual attraction]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGender stereotypes and roles:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_advertisement"}

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-01-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-02-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Renaissance]], maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly.

With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power.<ref name=\":0\" /> Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.\n\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]\n\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps.\"<ref name=Harley/>\n\nAlthough cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographer's 'black box'{{Definition needed|date=April 2019}} always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B.

General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref name=Ovenden>{{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5| pages=22, 60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |url=https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit |url-access=registration |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit/page/162 162\u2013163] |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H.

[[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map \"is convincing because it implies authenticity\".<ref>{{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}} (p.&nbsp;9)</ref> An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}} p.&nbsp;93</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''.

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-01-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-02-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Renaissance]], maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly.

Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]\n\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Cartographica, Vol. 26, No. 2. pp 1-5]</ref> An example of this understanding is that \"[<nowiki />European reproduction of terrain on maps] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth\u2026\".<ref name=Harley/> 17th-century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps.\"<ref name=Harley/>\n\nAlthough cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographer's 'black box'{{Definition needed|date=April 2019}} always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism. However, to later scholars in the field{{When|date=April 2019}}, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.<ref name=Harley/> For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.<ref name=\"Basset\" /> This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.{{Why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Map types==\n\n===General vs. thematic cartography===\n[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]\n[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]\n\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref name=Ovenden>{{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5| pages=22, 60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |url=https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit |url-access=registration |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit/page/162 162\u2013163] |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H.

[[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map \"is convincing because it implies authenticity\".<ref>{{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}} (p.&nbsp;9)</ref> An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}} p.&nbsp;93</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color.

For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled \"[[trap streets]]\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-53421-3 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}</ref> Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]</ref>\n\nAnother motive for deliberate errors is cartographic \"vandalism\": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.\n\n[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Main|Outline of cartography}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Animated mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Cartogram}}\n* {{annotated link|Terrain cartography|aka=Cartographic relief depiction}}\n* {{annotated link|City map}}\n* {{annotated link|Counter-mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Fantasy map}}\n* {{annotated link|Figure-ground in map design}}\n* {{annotated link|Geoinformatics}}\n* {{annotated link|Geovisualization}}\n* {{annotated link|Geo warping}}\n* {{annotated link|History of cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|History of Cartography Project}}\n* {{annotated link|List of cartographers}}\n* {{annotated link|Locator map}}\n* {{annotated link|OpenStreetMap}}\n* {{annotated link|Pictorial map}}\n* {{annotated link|Planetary cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Seafloor mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Scribing (cartography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Toponymy}}\n* {{annotated link|World map}}\n* {{annotated link|Page layout (cartography)}}\n<!-- The article titled ''{{annotated link|great circle distance}}'' explains how to find that quantity if one knows the two latitudes and longitudes. -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Mapmaking\n* {{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Kraak, Menno-Jan  |author2=Ormeling, Ferjan |title=Cartography: Visualization of Spatial Data |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-088890-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Peterson, Michael P. |title=Interactive and Animated Cartography |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-13-079104-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slocum, T. |title=Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-13-035123-4}}\n\n;History\n* {{cite book |title=Mapping the World: An Illustrated History of Cartography |author=Ralph E Ehrenberg |publisher=National Geographic |date=October 11, 2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 256] |isbn=978-0-7922-6525-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[John Brian Harley|J.

In 1919, after the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]], King [[Amanullah Khan]] announced Afghanistan's independence from [[Foreign relations of Afghanistan|foreign affairs]] at [[Id Gah Mosque|Eidgah Mosque]] in Kabul. Amanullah was reform-minded and he had a plan to build a new [[capital city]] on land about 6&nbsp;km away from Kabul. This area was named [[Darulaman]] and it consisted of the famous [[Darul Aman Palace]], where he later resided. Many educational institutions were founded in Kabul during the 1920s. In 1929 King Ammanullah left Kabul due to a local uprising orchestrated by [[Habibullah Kalakani]], but he himself was imprisoned and executed after nine months in power by King [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|Nader Khan]]. Three years later, in 1933, the new king was assassinated during an award ceremony inside a school in Kabul. The throne was left to his 19-year-old son, [[Mohammad Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], who became the last [[King of Afghanistan]]. Unlike Amanullah Khan, Nader Khan and Zahir Shah had no plans to create a new capital city, and thus Kabul remained the country's [[seat of government]].\n\n[[File:Darul Aman Place.png|thumb|The famous [[Darul Aman Palace]], built under King [[Amanullah Khan]] as part of an incompleted new capital city]]\n[[File:Serena Hotel in Kabul-2013.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kabul Serena Hotel|Serena Hotel]], opened 1945]]\nDuring the [[inter-war period]] France and Germany helped develop the country and maintained high schools and lycees in the capital, providing education for the children of the city's elite families.<ref>Anthony Hyman, \"Nationalism in Afghanistan\" in ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', 34:2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) 305.</ref> [[Kabul University]] opened in 1932 and by the 1960s western educated Afghans made up the majority of teachers.<ref name=\"Hyman, 305\">Hyman, 305.</ref> By the 1960s the majority of instructors at the university had degrees from Western universities.<ref name=\"Hyman, 305\"/>\n\nWhen Zahir Shah took power in 1933 Kabul had the only {{convert|6|mi|sp=us|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} of rail in the country and the country had few internal telegraphs, phone lines or roads.

Temperatures are cool compared to much of Southwest Asia, mainly due to the high elevation of the city. Summer has very low [[humidity]], providing relief from the heat. Autumn features warm afternoons and sharply cooler evenings. Winters are cold, with a January daily average of {{convert|\u22122.3|\u00b0C|1}}. Spring is the wettest time of the year. Sunny conditions dominate year-round. The annual mean temperature is {{convert|12.1|\u00b0C|1}}, much lower than the other large cities of Afghanistan.\n{{Update|section|reason=Kabul's Climate Data needs an update.

The better and safer ones are in the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood where the embassies are located.\n\nThe old part of Kabul is filled with [[bazaar]]s nestled along its narrow, crooked streets. Cultural sites include: the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]], notably displaying an impressive statue of [[Surya]] excavated at [[Khair Khana]], the ruined [[Darul Aman Palace]], the tomb of Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] at [[Bagh-e Babur]], and Chihil Sutun Park, the Minar-i-Istiqlal (Column of Independence) built in 1919 after the [[Third Afghan War]], the [[tomb of Timur Shah Durrani]], the [[Bagh-e Bala Palace]] and the imposing [[Id Gah Mosque]] (founded 1893). [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Bala Hissar]] is a fort destroyed by the British in 1879, in retaliation for the death of their envoy, now restored as a military college. There are also the [[Kolola Pushta]] fort, which is still garrisoned by the Afghan Army, and the nearby 19th-century [[Shahrara Tower]] fort, which was ruined in 1928. The [[Chakari, Afghanistan|Minaret of Chakari]], destroyed in 1998, had [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[swastika]] and both [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] qualities.\n\nOther places of interest include [[Kabul City Center]], which is Kabul's first shopping mall, the shops around Flower Street and Chicken Street, Wazir Akbar Khan district, [[Kabul Golf Club]], [[Kabul Zoo]], [[Abdul Rahman Mosque]], [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque|Shah-Do Shamshira]] and other famous mosques, the [[National Gallery of Afghanistan]], the [[National Archives of Afghanistan]], Afghan Royal Family Mausoleum, the [[OMAR Mine Museum]], Bibi Mahro Hill, Kabul Cemetery, and [[Paghman Gardens]]. The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) was also involved in the restoration of the [[Bagh-e Babur]] (Babur Gardens).\n\nTappe-i-Maranjan is a nearby hill where Buddhist [[statue]]s and Graeco-Bactrian [[coin]]s from the 2nd century BC have been found.

Although a nationwide bus service is available from Kabul, flying is safer, especially for foreigners. The city's public bus service ([[Millie Bus]] / \"National Bus\") was established in the 1960s to take [[commuters]] on daily routes to many destinations. The service has about 800 buses. The Kabul bus system has discovered a new source of revenue in whole-bus advertising from [[MTN Group|MTN]] similar to \"bus wrap\" advertising on public transit in more developed nations. There is also an express bus that runs from downtown to Hamid Karzai International Airport for [[Safi Airways]] passengers.\n\nAn electric [[trolleybus]] system operated in Kabul from February 1979 to 1992 using [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]] fleet built by a [[Czechoslovak]] company (see [[Trolleybuses in Kabul]] for more). The trolleybus service was highly popular mainly due to its low price compared to the Millie Bus conventional bus service. The last trolleybus came to a halt in late 1992 due to warfare - much of the [[copper]] [[Overhead line|overhead wires]] were later looted but a few of them, including the steel poles, can still be seen in Kabul today.<ref name=\"spvd.cz\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://languages.oberlin.edu/blogs/relg270/catherine-lytle-from-gerbils-to-trolleybus/|title=Catherine Lytle: From Gerbils to Trolleybus|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2017 Kabul Municipality unveiled plans for a [[Kabul bus rapid transit|new bus rapid transit]] system, the first major urban public transportation scheme.

Its [[ski resort]] ''Silvretta Arena Ischgl-Samnaun'' is connected with the ski resort of [[Samnaun]] across the border in [[Switzerland]] to form one of the largest skiing resorts in the [[Alps]]. Ischgl was a major hotspot of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]].\n\n==Ski resort==\nIschgl is located on the Austrian side of one of the world's largest ski areas. Its {{convert|238|km|||}} of groomed pistes are served by over 45 mechanical lifts including [[Aerial tramway|cable cars]], [[Gondola lift|gondolas]], [[Detachable chairlift|detachable chair lifts]] and some [[T-bar lift|T-bars]]. Three ropeways give access to the ski area from the village: the Pardatschgratbahn, the Fimbabahn & the Silvrettabahn. Only the Fimbabahn and the Silvrettabahn have middle stations.<ref name=\"ischgl.com\">[http://www.ischgl.com/ Ischgl.com]</ref> Many of the lifts converge at Idalp, where there is a restaurant. The area above Idalp offers wide, easy pistes and a snow park. Other parts of the Ischgl area, towards H\u00f6llboden and Paznauner Thaya, offer many red runs and some more challenging blacks. The steepest run in the resort is a black run with a gradient of 70%, located in the H\u00f6llboden bowl, and accessed by the \"Lange Wand\" chair lift. Paznauner Thaya offers many red runs suitable for intermediate-level skiers.\n\nIschgl is known for lively [[apr\u00e8s-ski]] parties and nightlife. The resort hosts pop concerts celebrating the end of the annual ski season (''Top of the Mountain Concert'') at the Idalp ({{convert|2300|m|disp=or||}}). [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Elton John]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[The Corrs]], [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Nena]], [[Sugababes]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Anastacia]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Melanie C]], [[Rihanna]], [[Gabriella Cilmi]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Katy Perry]] and [[Alicia Keys]] have performed at these concerts. In April 2002 [[Bill Clinton]] gave a speech at Ischgl.\n\n==Coronavirus pandemic hotspot==\nIschgl was identified as a major hotspot of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]]. Hundreds of [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Germany|infections in Germany]] and the [[Nordic countries]] were traced back to the ski resort [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iceland|starting from Iceland]] on 1 March with transmissions occurring from late February on. Significant portion of the cases were further traced to ''Kitzloch'' [[apr\u00e8s-ski]] bar at the resort, where sharing of [[whistle]]s were likely conduits of contagion. Even as health authorities in other countries began raising warnings against travel to Ischgl, the resort remained open with Tyrolean authorities playing down the risks.<ref

town in the [[Paznaun]] Valley in the [[Austria]]n state of [[state of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. Its [[ski resort]] ''Silvretta Arena Ischgl-Samnaun'' is connected with the ski resort of [[Samnaun]] across the border in [[Switzerland]] to form one of the largest skiing resorts in the [[Alps]]. Ischgl was a major hotspot of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]].\n\n==Ski resort==\nIschgl is located on the Austrian side of one of the world's largest ski areas. Its {{convert|238|km|||}} of groomed pistes are served by over 45 mechanical lifts including [[Aerial tramway|cable cars]], [[Gondola lift|gondolas]], [[Detachable chairlift|detachable chair lifts]] and some [[T-bar lift|T-bars]]. Three ropeways give access to the ski area from the village: the Pardatschgratbahn, the Fimbabahn & the Silvrettabahn. Only the Fimbabahn and the Silvrettabahn have middle stations.<ref name=\"ischgl.com\">[http://www.ischgl.com/ Ischgl.com]</ref> Many of the lifts converge at Idalp, where there is a restaurant. The area above Idalp offers wide, easy pistes and a snow park. Other parts of the Ischgl area, towards H\u00f6llboden and Paznauner Thaya, offer many red runs and some more challenging blacks. The steepest run in the resort is a black run with a gradient of 70%, located in the H\u00f6llboden bowl, and accessed by the \"Lange Wand\" chair lift. Paznauner Thaya offers many red runs suitable for intermediate-level skiers.\n\nIschgl is known for lively [[apr\u00e8s-ski]] parties and nightlife. The resort hosts pop concerts celebrating the end of the annual ski season (''Top of the Mountain Concert'') at the Idalp ({{convert|2300|m|disp=or||}}). [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Elton John]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[The Corrs]], [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Nena]], [[Sugababes]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Anastacia]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Melanie C]], [[Rihanna]], [[Gabriella Cilmi]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Katy Perry]] and [[Alicia Keys]] have performed at these concerts. In April 2002 [[Bill Clinton]] gave a speech at Ischgl.\n\n==Coronavirus pandemic hotspot==\nIschgl was identified as a major hotspot of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]]. Hundreds of [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Germany|infections in Germany]] and the [[Nordic countries]] were traced back to the ski resort [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iceland|starting from Iceland]] on 1 March with transmissions occurring from late February on. Significant portion of the cases were further traced to \"Kitzloch\" [[apr\u00e8s-ski]] bar at the resort, where sharing of [[whistle]]s were likely conduits of contagion. Even as health authorities in other countries began raising warnings against travel to Ischgl, the resort remained open with Tyrolean authorities playing down the risks.<ref name=grull2020-03-20>{{cite web |last1=Gr\u00fcll |first1=Philipp |title=How an Austrian ski paradise became a COVID-19 hotspot |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/ischgl-oesterreichisches-skiparadies-als-corona-hotspot/ |website=www.euractiv.com |publisher=[[Euractiv]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323174922/https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/ischgl-oesterreichisches-skiparadies-als-corona-hotspot/ |archivedate=23 March 2020 |language=en |date=20 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The bar was eventually closed on 10 March and the whole town quarantined from 13 March on.<ref name=mayr>{{cite news |last1=Mayr |first1=Walter |title=Austrian Ski Resort Flings Coronavirus Around Europe |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/ischgl-austrian-ski-resort-flings-coronavirus-around-europe-a-68e10295-1d9c-42cc-9e52-7fea35436479 |accessdate=20 March 2020 |work=Der Spiegel |date=17 March 2020 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20200321131420/https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/ischgl-austrian-ski-resort-flings-coronavirus-around-europe-a-68e10295-1d9c-42cc-9e52-7fea35436479 |archivedate=21 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Karnitschnig>{{cite web |last1=Karnitschnig |first1=Matthew |title=The Austrian ski town that spread coronavirus across the Continent |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/the-austrian-ski-town-that-spread-coronavirus-across-the-continent/ |website=Politico |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 March 2020 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20200323121016/https://www.politico.eu/article/the-austrian-ski-town-that-spread-coronavirus-across-the-continent/ |archivedate=23 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"left\">\nFile:Ischgl, katholische Pfarrkirche heilige Nikolaus Dm64328 foto4 2014-07-23 15.00.jpg|Roman Catholic church St. Nikolaus\nFile:Tussen Ischgl en Kappl, rivier de Ischgl foto6 2014-07-23 14.52.jpg|Trisanna river\n</gallery>\n{{wide image|Panorama Ischgl Pardorama.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Ischgl Pardorama}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage}}\n*[http://www.ischgl.com/ Official Ischgl website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120224175134/http://www.360travelguide.com/360VirtualTour.asp?iCode=isc12 Panoramic photo of Ischgl resort centre]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category}}\n{{Cities and towns in Landeck (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ski areas and resorts in Austria]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Tyrol (state)]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Landeck District]]\n[[Category:Verwall Alps]]\n[[Category:Silvretta Alps]]\n", "name_user": "Sekundogenitur", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCoronavirus pandemic hotspot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischgl"}

It is located conveniently, connecting four international borders i.e. [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Bhutan]]. It also connects the North-East with the Indian mainland and is connected with all other districts of West Bengal. Located at the foothills of [[Eastern Himalaya]], Siliguri is a trading and transportation hub. Over time, Siliguri has grown from a village into a commercially progressive city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siligurismc.in/history-of-siliguri.php|title=History of Siliguri-SMC|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> Siliguri has been ruled by a few eminent dynasties like [[Chogyal]]s of the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607215048/http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-date=20 May 2019|title=History of Darjeeling, Sikkim, Nepal|publisher=Official website of Nepal Army}}</ref> and its countless strategic offerings were realised after independence.<ref name=\"Siliguri municipal corporation - A historical profile\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=History of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Age history===\nAccording to Sailen Debnath, \"Siliguri\" means a stack of pebbles or stones. Till the 19th century this region was called as \"Shilchaguri\" when there was dense Dolka forest covering the area. Because of its appeal as an agricultural village, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] captured Siliguri making it the southernmost part of their kingdom until the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] interfered. Because of it [[Kirati people|Kirati]] and [[Nepalis]] came to settle in this region.<ref name=\"History of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf|website=asiscwb.org|title=Middle age history of Siliguri|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt that time a river ([[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]) port, South of Siliguri in [[Phansidewa]] had an important role in having trade bond with [[Malda City|Malda]], [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]. This riverine trade line was thus used by the [[Bhutan]]ese and [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] to bring goods into their mainland.\n\n===Modern history===\nSiliguri started as a small area i.e. now Saktigarh, southern part of city, on the bank of [[Mahananda River]]. [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1815 signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospect of Siliguri. As it became a point of transit with [[Darjeeling]] hills and [[Nepal]] mainland. 1815 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic convenience of trade. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling & the entire [[Dooars]] region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. For easy exportation they introduced the [[Siliguri Town railway station]] which stands to this day, and introduced the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Toy train]] from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri to gain Sub-Divisional town status in 1907.<ref name=\"Historical profile of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=Modern history of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Siliguri Corridor]]\" was formed when [[Bengal]] was divided into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sikkim Voters OK Merger With India |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=16 April 1975|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better facilities which led to an increased population.

The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981, considering this growth, Siliguri came under Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri touched 46.83% of population growth rate in 1981-1991. A treaty between India and China for trade through [[Nathu La|Nathu La Pass]], has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri. Siliguri has now achieved the status of becoming the [[List of metropolitan area in West Bengal|2nd]] largest metropolitan city in [[West Bengal]], after [[Kolkata]].<ref>{{cite

It is located conveniently, connecting four international borders i.e. [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Bhutan]]. It also connects the North-East with the Indian mainland and is connected with all other districts of West Bengal. Located at the foothills of [[Eastern Himalaya]], Siliguri is a trading and transportation hub. Over time, Siliguri has grown from a village into a commercially progressive city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siligurismc.in/history-of-siliguri.php|title=History of Siliguri-SMC|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> Siliguri has been ruled by a few eminent dynasties like [[Chogyal]]s of the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607215048/http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-date=20 May 2019|title=History of Darjeeling, Sikkim, Nepal|publisher=Official website of Nepal Army}}</ref> and its countless strategic offerings were realised after independence.<ref name=\"Siliguri municipal corporation - A historical profile\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=History of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Age history===\nAccording to Sailen Debnath, \"Siliguri\" means a stack of pebbles or stones. Till the 19th century this region was called as \"Shilchaguri\" when there was dense Dolka forest covering the area. Because of its appeal as an agricultural village, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] captured Siliguri making it the southernmost part of their kingdom until the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] interfered. Because of it [[Kirati people|Kirati]] and [[Nepalis]] came to settle in this region.<ref name=\"History of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf|website=asiscwb.org|title=Middle age history of Siliguri|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt that time a river ([[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]) port, South of Siliguri in [[Phansidewa]] had an important role in having trade bond with [[Malda City|Malda]], [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]. This riverine trade line was thus used by the [[Bhutan]]ese and [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] to bring goods into their mainland.\n\n===Modern history===\nSiliguri started as a small area i.e. now Saktigarh, southern part of city, on the bank of [[Mahananda River]]. [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1815 signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospect of Siliguri. As it became a point of transit with [[Darjeeling]] hills and [[Nepal]] mainland. 1815 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic convenience of trade. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling & the entire [[Dooars]] region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. For easy exportation they introduced the [[Siliguri Town railway station]] which stands to this day, and introduced the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Toy train]] from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri to gain Sub-Divisional town status in 1907.<ref name=\"Historical profile of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=Modern history of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Siliguri Corridor]]\" was formed when [[Bengal]] was divided into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sikkim Voters OK Merger With India |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=16 April 1975|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better facilities which led to an increased population.

The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981, considering this growth, Siliguri came under Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri touched 46.83% of population growth rate in 1981-1991. A treaty between India and China for trade through [[Nathu La|Nathu La Pass]], has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri. Siliguri has now achieved the status of becoming the [[List of metropolitan area in West Bengal|2nd]] largest metropolitan city in [[West Bengal]], after [[Kolkata]].<ref>{{cite

The governor is the [[head of state]] appointed by the [[President of India]]. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the chief minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the chief minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly.\n# The legislature, the [[Telangana Legislative Assembly]] and the [[Telangana Legislative Council]], consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the speaker or the deputy speaker in the speaker's absence. The Assembly is [[bicameral]] with 119 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] and 40 [[Member of the Legislative Council]]. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. The Legislative Council is a permanent body with one-third members retiring every two years.\n# The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad]] and a system of lower courts.\n\nAuxiliary authorities known as ''[[panchayat]]s'', for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes seats to [[Lok Sabha]].\n\nThe main players in the [[Politics of Telangana|regional politics]] are the [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]], [[All India Forward Bloc]], [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen]], [[Telugu Desam Party]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and [[Indian National Congress]].

He is known as leader of the '''Flatters expedition''', an ill-fated attempt to explore the route of a proposed Trans-Saharan railway from Algeria to the Sudan. Almost all members of the expedition were massacred by hostile [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]s. The survivors resorted to eating grass and to [[cannibalism]] on the long retreat through the desert. After a brief outburst of public indignation the fiasco was forgotten.\n\n==Background and early years (1832\u201353)==\nPaul-Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Flatters was the son of [[Jean-Jacques Flatters]] (1786\u20131845) and \u00c9milie-Dirc\u00e9e Lebon.{{sfn|Garric}}\nHis father came from [[Westphalia]] to Paris to study sculpture and painting.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=87}} He was a student of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]] and [[Jacques-Louis David]], and was second in the [[Prix de Rome]] for sculpture in 1813.{{sfn|Garric}} He served in the French army from February to July 1814 at the close of the [[First French Empire]].{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=87}} During the [[Bourbon Restoration]] Jean-Jacques Flatters earned a living by making busts of famous people such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Lord Byron|Byron]]. Paul Flatters' maternal grandfather, Simon Lebon, joined the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]] and served in the army until retiring as a colonel on half pay in December 1815. He married into a leading family of the Naples aristocracy in 1807. His daughter, \u00c9mile-Dirc\u00e9e Lebon married Jean-Jacques Flatters in 1830.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}}\n\n[[File:Turenne.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] by Jean-Jacques Flatters {{circa|1834}}]]\nPaul Flatters was born in Paris on 16 September 1832.{{sfn|Garric}}\nIn 1845, when he was just thirteen, he lost his father. A patron and friend of the family, [[Baron Isidore Justin S\u00e9verin Taylor|Baron Isidore Taylor]], paid for his education in the Lyc\u00e9e de Laval in [[Laval, Mayenne]].{{sfn|Garric}}{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}} Paul's mother died in 1850.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}} He was admitted to the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] in 1851.{{sfn|Garric}} Flatters graduated from Saint-Cyr in October 1853, ranked 65th out of 230 students.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}}\n\n==Algerian administration (1853\u201380)==\n\nFlatters was made a second lieutenant and posted to Algeria with the [[Zouave|3rd Zouaves]].{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}} He was appointed lieutenant in 1855.{{sfn|Grandjean}} In 1856 he was granted a request to transfer to the Arab Bureau (''bureaux arabes''), which had been created by Marshal [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]] to administer the indigenous population.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}} Flatters did not serve in the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u201356 or the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] of 1859.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}} In January 1863 he spent three month's leave in Paris. There he met and became engaged to the 19 year old Sara-Marie Le Gros, sister of a former schoolmate at Laval.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}} Flatters was promoted to captain in 1864.{{sfn|Grandjean}} He married Sarah Marie Legros (1845\u20131933) in Paris on 1 May 1864. Their son \u00c9tienne Paul Jean Flatters (1868\u20131950) would become a Brigadier General.{{sfn|Garric}} Due to the rough conditions in Algeria his wife could not accompany him when he returned to Algeria, and for the next fifteen years they spent time together only when he was on leave or during  the short periods when he was stationed in France.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}}\n\nFlatters learned to read classical [[Arabic]] and to speak the local vernacular form, and became interested in local history and culture, although his scholarship was always superficial.\nHe published ''Histoire ancienne du Nord de l'Afrique avant le conqu\u00eate des Arabes'' in 1863 for an Arab audience.\nThe book asserted that North Africa was a [[Berbers|Berber]] country to which both [[Islam]] and [[Arabs]] were alien newcomers.\nThe governor general approved, and ordered the book to be distributed to all the Berbers of the [[Kabylie]].\nIn 1865 he published a revised version of the book for a European audience, ''Histoire de la g\u00e9ographies et g\u00e9ology de le province de Constantine''.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}}\n\nFlatters served in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, but was taken prisoner almost at once and transferred to Germany.\nHe was in Paris in April\u2013May 1871 when the [[Paris Commune]] was suppressed.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}}\nIn 1871 responsibility for administration in the departments of Constantine, Algiers and Oran was transferred to civilians, but the army continued to administer the interior of Algeria.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}}\nIn 1871 Flatters was promoted to major.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nHe was based at [[Laghouat]] and worked on administrative tasks.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=213}}\n\nIn 1876 and 1877 Flatters wrote three reports on the caravan trade between the Sudan and the Mediterranean, blaming some of the problems on the [[Senussi]] Sufi order and tribe.\nThe reports show that Flatters was fully aware that any European who ventured into the desert without strong protection would almost inevitably be killed.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=94}}\nHe also observed that the Turks and the merchants of [[Tripoli]], [[Ghadames]], [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]] and [[Murzuk]] would be opposed to a Trans-Saharan railway that would divert trade to Algeria.\nHe cast doubt on whether France would benefit from such a railway when the British were supplying much cheaper trade goods.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n{{Location map+|Algeria|width=220|relief=y|caption=Locations in Algeria| places =\n  {{Location map~|Algeria|label=Constantine|position=

slaves.\nMany went to other parts of the [[Maghreb]], but Flatters said that 1,000 were brought to Algeria each year.\nDue to French abolition of slavery, the merchants in the Sahara would not allow a French presence in the desert.\nFlatters argued that the French should therefore tolerate and regulate the trade in slaves, which was inevitable, so as to gain access to the interior.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=176}}\nIn 1879 he published a long article in the ''[[Revue historique]]'' titled ''\u00c9tude sur l'Afrique septentrionale des origines \u00e0 l'invasion arabe''.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}}\nOn 3 May 1879 he was promoted to  lieutenant-colonel and returned to France.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\n\n==First expedition (1879\u201380)==\n\nThe Trans-Saharan expedition was appointed in 1879 by [[Charles de Freycinet]], Minister of Public Works, to investigate construction of a railway across the [[Sahara]].\nThree possible routes starting from [[Oran]] in the west, [[Algiers]] in the center and [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] in the east were to be examined by three expeditions.\nThe western expedition was led by the engineer [[Justin Pouyanne]]. \nThe central one was led by the engineer [[Auguste Choisy]] and included [[Georges Rolland]].\nThese two expeditions would complete their work without difficulty.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=633}}\nThe eastern route was considered the most dangerous, going via the Hoggar Tuareg town of [[Rhat]].{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=633}}\nFlatters lobbied in Paris to be chosen as leader of this mission.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=212}}\nAt the age of 48 he was relatively old to lead the expedition.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=213}}\nHe suffered from [[sciatica]] and depended on [[morphine]] to relieve his pain, and had unpredictable moods.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=347}}\n\nFlatters originally proposed a major expedition with more than 200 ''[[tirailleur]]s'' to provide strong protection, and was supported in this by the military members of the commission.\nHe was opposed by [[Henri Duveyrier]], who had experience of army blundering and was convinced that only small and unobtrusive expeditions whose members adapted to local customs could succeed.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=347}}\nThe mid-19th century explorer Duveyrier had developed a romantic view of the Tuaregs as peace-loving, honorable people.\nIn fact they were ruthless in dealing with intruders into their land using whatever methods they saw fit.{{sfn|Asher|2011}}\nDuveyrier was supported by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] of [[Suez Canal]] fame and other civilian members.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=347}}\nA compromise was agreed where the size of the expedition was cut in half, making it a target without adequate means of defense.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=348}}\n\n[[File:Flatters Lombart.jpg|thumb|The Flatter expedition crosses a marsh. [[Chocolats Lombart]] trading card {{circa|1900}}]]\nFlatters returned to Algeria in November 1879, charged with reconnoitering the route that he had himself said was the most favorable for the proposed railway.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nHe left Constantine on 25 January 1880 with 12 Europeans supported by Algerian ''tirailleurs'', cameleers and [[Chaamba]] guides.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=212}}\nThe future Islamologist [[Alfred Le Ch\u00e2telier]] was an assistant topographer.{{sfn|Pastoureau|2008|p=10}}\nThe caravan travelled south to [[Ouargla]].{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=212}}\nFlatters left from [[Ouargla]] on 5 March 1880 with thirty-nine people.\nThey traveled south through the Igharghar valley past [[A\u00efn Ta\u00efba]], El-Bodh and Timassinin. \nFrom Timassinin the expedition headed southeast along the Igharghar valley, and on 16 April 1880 encamped on shores of [[Lake Menghough]] on the fringe of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] of the Ajjer country. \nWith provisions running short and the local people showing hostility, Flatters decided to return by the same route.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\n\nThe French began their retreat northward on the morning of 21 April 1880.\nCaptain Masson was given the rearguard with orders to \"die to the last man if need be so the convoy can get away\".\nIn fact the Tuareg did little to harass the column.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=110}}\nPressed by Masson, who thought it necessary to save the expedition, on 27 April 1880 Flatters sent a letter to the Amenoukal of the Ahaggar Tuareg in which he promised to return the next winter.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=110}}\nThe expedition returned intact to Ouargla on 17 May 1880 with valuable information about the country.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nThe valley of the Igharghar river offered a promising route to the [[Niger River]].{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=634}}\n\n==Second expedition (1880\u201381)==\n\n===Advance===\nFlatters quickly returned to Paris to raise support for a second expedition.\nHe received a less enthusiastic reception than with the first expedition, and some of the officers from the first expedition chose not to accompany him on the second attempt.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=212}}\nLeaders of the expedition included Flatters, the civil engineers Beringer and Roche, Captain Masson of the artillery corps and Dr. Guiard, all of whom had served on the first expedition.\nOther members were Lieutenant de Dianous and the civil engineer Santin, who replaced the infantry second lieutenants Le Chatelier and Brosselard of the first expedition.\nThere were also two French staff soldiers, Brame and Marjollet, 47 Algerian sharpshooters, 31 Arab volunteers who had formerly served in the army, 7 [[Chaamba]] guides and a Muslim mullah of the Tedjini order.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=634}}\n\nThe second expedition of 93 men left Ouargla on 4 December 1880 and traveled south by a road west of that taken by the first expedition.\nIt went up the Wadi Mia to Inifel, then along the Wadi Insokki to the Insokki well.\nFrom there it went southeast by Messeguem, bypassing the Tademait plateau in [[Amguid]].{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nAfter three months of travel through the desert the expedition reached Sebka.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=634}}\nThis is the most southern point reached by the Romans, and the expedition saw the ruins of a monument raised by General [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Cornelius Balbo]] in 44 BC.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=636}}\nThe expedition went on from Sebkha, heading towards Asiou, an important point in the central Sahara from which Flatters hoped to reach the Sudan without difficulty. \nOn 16 February 1881 the expedition stopped at [[Bir el-Garama]] about {{convert|200|km}} north of Asiou.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nThe site is near today's city of [[Tamanrasset]].{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=3}}\n\n===Massacre===\n[[File:Carte d'une partie du Sahara (...)Brosselard-Faidherbe Henri btv1b8439071r.jpg|thumb|Part of the Central Sahara showing routes of the two missions from the draft Ministry of Public Works map and the itinerary of [[Henri Brosselard-Faidherbe|H. Brosselard]], member of the 1st expedition]]\nBefore the expedition left Ouargla plans had been made to destroy it by the [[Kel Ahaggar]] Tuaregs of the [[Hoggar Mountains]], the [[Awlad Sidi Shaykh]] confederation and the [[Senussi]].\nThey knew the planned route and were kept informed by the expedition's guides, who helped sabotage the expedition by leading it past wells.\nSix hundred men of the three tribes gathered to ambush the expedition near Bir el-Garama.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nTuaregs had been shadowing the expedition for several days when it approached the wells of Bir-el-Gharama.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=636}}\nHowever Flatters considered that Ahitagel ag Muhammad Biska, the Amenukal of the Kel Ahaggar, completely controlled the area and would ensure that no French were harmed in his land.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=239}}\n\nNear In-Uhawen, or the wells of Tadjenout, Flatters left his baggage in camp with half his troops while he and his officers and scientific staff went to find the well, followed by the camels.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=239}}\nFlatters told a guide who warned of danger, \"we have nothing to fear\".\nHalf an hour after they found the well, Flatters and his men were surrounded by a large force of Tuaregs armed with lances and muzzle-loading muskets.\nSome men tried to flee on the camels, but the animals refused to leave the well.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=240}}\nFlatters, Masson, Beringer, Roche, Guiard and the expedition's commissary Deverny were killed, as were 30 camel drivers.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=636}}\nOnly ten men escaped.\nThe Tuaregs took almost all of the 250 camels.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=240}}\n\n===Retreat===\n\nThe camp was not attacked. Lieutenant de Dianous took command.\nWithout camels the survivors were limited in the amount they could carry.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=636}}\nThe 56 survivors, including 4 Frenchmen, were well armed against attack but had no transportation and very little water.\nTraveling by foot the {{convert|1500|km}} retreat to Ouargla would take 2\u20133 months.\nThey decided to leave that night after burning most of their supplies and dividing the mission's 102,000 francs between them.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=240}}\nThey also divided the food and ammunition, and gave the strongest men the skins of water to carry.\nThey struggled back, suffering from hunger and thirst.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=636}}\nThe Touareg picked off beasts of burden and stragglers.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\n\nBy 22 February 1881 the survivors were almost out of food, and a few days later were eating grass.\nThey straggled on, with the strongest going ahead in the hope of finding game.\nWhen they had lost all hope, a group of Tuaregs approached and offered to sell them milk, meat and dates at a high price.\nThe dates turned out to be poisoned with a substance that caused dizziness and psychosis.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=240}}\nThis came from the plant called ''Falezlez'' by the Tuaregs (''[[Hyoscyamus muticus]]'', or Egyptian henbane).{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=636}}\nThe effect was to induce a burning sensation in the victims' lungs, and to cause them to rush about madly and fire off their guns.\nMany of the sharpshooters and Chaamba  had avoided the dates and were able to restore calm, and the poisoned men recovered after vomiting.\nSome of the party escaped during this incident.\nThe retreat continued the next day.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=637}}\n\nThe wells at Amguid were guarded by a strong force of Tuaregs who were driven away after a fight in which de Dianous, Santin, Brame, Marjolet and 12 ''tirailleurs'' were killed.\nThe only remaining Frenchman was the commissary Pob\u00e9guin.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=637}}\nThe survivors broke up into small groups, each suspicious that the others were hoarding.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=240}}\nOn 23 March 1881 an Algerian ''tirailleur'' in Pob\u00e9guin's group was shot.\nSeveral men built a large fire and cooked the \"mutton\" which they offered to Pob\u00e9guin, but he refused to eat it.\nWith all discipline gone more victims were shot and eaten, and Pob\u00e9guin eventually joined in.\nHe himself was killed and eaten by the end of March.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=241}}\nFour ''tirailleurs'' reached Ouargla on 2 April 1881, and three others were picked up on the road.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=637}}\nOn 4 April 1881 the last survivors arrived at Messeguem.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nTowards the end of April about a dozen exhausted survivors reached Ouargla.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=241}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe first response when the news reached France was shock, followed by calls to punish the Ahaggar Tuareg and make greater efforts to colonize the Sahara. However, interest soon faded and the tragedy was forgotten.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=213}}\nSome of the newspapers held Duveyrier partly to blame for the disaster with his opposition to military force and utterly inaccurate depiction of the \"vicious, cruel and barbaric\" Tuareg.\nDuveyrier tried to vindicate his approach by two solo expeditions into the [[Rif]] mountains in Morocco.\nHe became increasingly disturbed by guilt and anger, and took his own life on 24 April 1892.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=348}}\nThe disaster caused plans for a railway to be abandoned.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=637}}\nFrom some of the letters written by Flatters before the disaster it was possible to assemble some information on the country the expedition had travelled through. \nFor several decades this was the main source of information on the central Sahara.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nThere is a marble column with a bronze plaque commemorating the Flatters Expedition in the Parc Montsouris in the 14th arrondissement of Paris.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=210}}\nAnother memorial was erected in Ouargla.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=211}}\n\n==Publications==\n\nPublications by Paul Flatters include:\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation|author=Paul Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Flatters|title=Histoire ancienne du Nord de l'Afrique avant le conqu\u00eate des Arabes|year=1863|ref=none}}\n*{{citation|author=Paul Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Flatters|title=Histoire de la g\u00e9ographies et g\u00e9ology de le province de Constantine|year=1865|ref=none}}\n*{{citation|author=Paul Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Flatters|title=\u00c9tude sur l'Afrique septentrionale des origines \u00e0 l'invasion arabe|year=1879|journal=Revue historique|ref=none}}\n*{{citation|title=L'Afrique septentrionale ancienne|pages=91 |journal=Revue africaine |location=Algiers|publisher=A.

He is known as leader of the '''Flatters expedition''', an ill-fated attempt to explore the route of a proposed Trans-Saharan railway from Algeria to the Sudan. Almost all members of the expedition were massacred by hostile [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]s. The survivors resorted to eating grass and to [[cannibalism]] on the long retreat through the desert. After a brief outburst of public indignation the fiasco was forgotten.\n\n==Background and early years (1832\u201353)==\nPaul-Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Flatters was the son of [[Jean-Jacques Flatters]] (1786\u20131845) and \u00c9milie-Dirc\u00e9e Lebon.{{sfn|Garric}}\nHis father came from [[Westphalia]] to Paris to study sculpture and painting.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=87}} He was a student of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]] and [[Jacques-Louis David]], and was second in the [[Prix de Rome]] for sculpture in 1813.{{sfn|Garric}} He served in the French army from February to July 1814 at the close of the [[First French Empire]].{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=87}} During the [[Bourbon Restoration]] Jean-Jacques Flatters earned a living by making busts of famous people such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Lord Byron|Byron]]. Paul Flatters' maternal grandfather, Simon Lebon, joined the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]] and served in the army until retiring as a colonel on half pay in December 1815. He married into a leading family of the Naples aristocracy in 1807. His daughter, \u00c9mile-Dirc\u00e9e Lebon married Jean-Jacques Flatters in 1830.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}}\n\n[[File:Turenne.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] by Jean-Jacques Flatters {{circa|1834}}]]\nPaul Flatters was born in Paris on 16 September 1832.{{sfn|Garric}}\nIn 1845, when he was just thirteen, he lost his father. A patron and friend of the family, [[Baron Isidore Justin S\u00e9verin Taylor|Baron Isidore Taylor]], paid for his education in the Lyc\u00e9e de Laval in [[Laval, Mayenne]].{{sfn|Garric}}{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}} Paul's mother died in 1850.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}} He was admitted to the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] in 1851.{{sfn|Garric}} Flatters graduated from Saint-Cyr in October 1853, ranked 65th out of 230 students.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}}\n\n==Algerian administration (1853\u201380)==\n\nFlatters was made a second lieutenant and posted to Algeria with the [[Zouave|3rd Zouaves]].{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=88}} He was appointed lieutenant in 1855.{{sfn|Grandjean}} In 1856 he was granted a request to transfer to the Arab Bureau (''bureaux arabes''), which had been created by Marshal [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]] to administer the indigenous population.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}} Flatters did not serve in the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u201356 or the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] of 1859.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}} In January 1863 he spent three month's leave in Paris. There he met and became engaged to the 19 year old Sara-Marie Le Gros, sister of a former schoolmate at Laval.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}} Flatters was promoted to captain in 1864.{{sfn|Grandjean}} He married Sarah Marie Legros (1845\u20131933) in Paris on 1 May 1864. Their son \u00c9tienne Paul Jean Flatters (1868\u20131950) would become a Brigadier General.{{sfn|Garric}} Due to the rough conditions in Algeria his wife could not accompany him when he returned to Algeria, and for the next fifteen years they spent time together only when he was on leave or during  the short periods when he was stationed in France.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}}\n\nFlatters learned to read classical [[Arabic]] and to speak the local vernacular form, and became interested in local history and culture, although his scholarship was always superficial.\nHe published ''Histoire ancienne du Nord de l'Afrique avant le conqu\u00eate des Arabes'' in 1863 for an Arab audience.\nThe book asserted that North Africa was a [[Berbers|Berber]] country to which both [[Islam]] and [[Arabs]] were alien newcomers.\nThe governor general approved, and ordered the book to be distributed to all the Berbers of the [[Kabylie]].\nIn 1865 he published a revised version of the book for a European audience, ''Histoire de la g\u00e9ographies et g\u00e9ology de le province de Constantine''.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}}\n\nFlatters served in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, but was taken prisoner almost at once and transferred to Germany.\nHe was in Paris in April\u2013May 1871 when the [[Paris Commune]] was suppressed.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=93}}\nIn 1871 responsibility for administration in the departments of Constantine, Algiers and Oran was transferred to civilians, but the army continued to administer the interior of Algeria.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}}\nIn 1871 Flatters was promoted to major.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nHe was based at [[Laghouat]] and worked on administrative tasks.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=213}}\n\nIn 1876 and 1877 Flatters wrote three reports on the caravan trade between the Sudan and the Mediterranean, blaming some of the problems on the [[Senussi]] Sufi order and tribe.\nThe reports show that Flatters was fully aware that any European who ventured into the desert without strong protection would almost inevitably be killed.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=94}}\nHe also observed that the Turks and the merchants of [[Tripoli]], [[Ghadames]], [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]] and [[Murzuk]] would be opposed to a Trans-Saharan railway that would divert trade to Algeria.\nHe cast doubt on whether France would benefit from such a railway when the British were supplying much cheaper trade goods.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n{{Location map+|Algeria|width=220|relief=y|caption=Locations in Algeria| places =\n  {{Location map~|Algeria|label=Constantine|position=

slaves.\nMany went to other parts of the [[Maghreb]], but Flatters said that 1,000 were brought to Algeria each year.\nDue to French abolition of slavery, the merchants in the Sahara would not allow a French presence in the desert.\nFlatters argued that the French should therefore tolerate and regulate the trade in slaves, which was inevitable, so as to gain access to the interior.{{sfn|Brower|2011|p=176}}\nIn 1879 he published a long article in the ''[[Revue historique]]'' titled ''\u00c9tude sur l'Afrique septentrionale des origines \u00e0 l'invasion arabe''.{{sfn|Porch|2005|p=89}}\nOn 3 May 1879 he was promoted to  lieutenant-colonel and returned to France.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\n\n==First expedition (1879\u201380)==\n\nThe Trans-Saharan expedition was appointed in 1879 by [[Charles de Freycinet]], Minister of Public Works, to investigate construction of a railway across the [[Sahara]].\nThree possible routes starting from [[Oran]] in the west, [[Algiers]] in the center and [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] in the east were to be examined by three expeditions.\nThe western expedition was led by the engineer [[Justin Pouyanne]]. \nThe central one was led by the engineer [[Auguste Choisy]] and included [[Georges Rolland]].\nThese two expeditions would complete their work without difficulty.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=633}}\nThe eastern route was considered the most dangerous, going via the Hoggar Tuareg town of [[Rhat]].{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=633}}\nFlatters lobbied in Paris to be chosen as leader of this mission.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=212}}\nAt the age of 48 he was relatively old to lead the expedition.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=213}}\nHe suffered from [[sciatica]] and depended on [[morphine]] to relieve his pain, and had unpredictable moods.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=347}}\n\nFlatters originally proposed a major expedition with more than 200 ''[[tirailleur]]s'' to provide strong protection, and was supported in this by the military members of the commission.\nHe was opposed by [[Henri Duveyrier]], who had experience of army blundering and was convinced that only small and unobtrusive expeditions whose members adapted to local customs could succeed.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=347}}\nThe mid-19th century explorer Duveyrier had developed a romantic view of the Tuaregs as peace-loving, honorable people.\nIn fact they were ruthless in dealing with intruders into their land using whatever methods they saw fit.{{sfn|Asher|2011}}\nDuveyrier was supported by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] of [[Suez Canal]] fame and other civilian members.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=347}}\nA compromise was agreed where the size of the expedition was cut in half, making it a target without adequate means of defense.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=348}}\n\n[[File:Flatters Lombart.jpg|thumb|The Flatter expedition crosses a marsh.

However, interest soon faded and the tragedy was forgotten.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=213}}\nSome of the newspapers held Duveyrier partly to blame for the disaster with his opposition to military force and utterly inaccurate depiction of the \"vicious, cruel and barbaric\" Tuareg.\nDuveyrier tried to vindicate his approach by two solo expeditions into the [[Rif]] mountains in Morocco.\nHe became increasingly disturbed by guilt and anger, and took his own life on 24 April 1892.{{sfn|Heffernan|1989|p=348}}\nThe disaster caused plans for a railway to be abandoned.{{sfn|Ney|1891|p=637}}\nFrom some of the letters written by Flatters before the disaster it was possible to assemble some information on the country the expedition had travelled through. \nFor several decades this was the main source of information on the central Sahara.{{sfn|Grandjean}}\nThere is a marble column with a bronze plaque commemorating the Flatters Expedition in the Parc Montsouris in the 14th arrondissement of Paris.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=210}}\nAnother memorial was erected in Ouargla.{{sfn|Strachan|2011|p=211}}\n\n==Publications==\n\nPublications by Paul Flatters include:\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation|author=Paul Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Flatters|title=Histoire ancienne du Nord de l'Afrique avant le conqu\u00eate des Arabes|year=1863|ref=none}}\n*{{citation|author=Paul Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Flatters|title=Histoire de la g\u00e9ographies et g\u00e9ology de le province de Constantine|year=1865|ref=none}}\n*{{citation|author=Paul Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Flatters|title=\u00c9tude sur l'Afrique septentrionale des origines \u00e0 l'invasion arabe|year=1879|journal=Revue historique|ref=none}}\n*{{citation|title=L'Afrique septentrionale ancienne|pages=91 |journal=Revue africaine |location=Algiers|publisher=A.

Such social groups function as protective [[clique]]s within the physical groups in which the primates live. The number of social group members a primate can track appears to be limited by the volume of the neocortex.  This suggests that there is a species-specific index of the social group size, computable from the species' mean neocortical volume.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1992,<ref name=\"dunbar92\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Dunbar | first1 = R.

Using a regression equation on data for 38 primate [[genera]], Dunbar predicted a human \"mean group size\" of 148 (casually rounded to 150), a result he considered exploratory due to the large error measure (a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 230).<ref name=\"dunbar92\"/>\n\nDunbar then compared this prediction with observable group sizes for humans.  Beginning with the assumption that the current mean size of the human neocortex had developed about 250,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], Dunbar searched the [[anthropological]] and [[ethnographical]] literature for census-like group size information for various [[hunter\u2013gatherer]] societies, the closest existing approximations to how anthropology reconstructs the Pleistocene societies. Dunbar noted that the groups fell into three categories\u2014small, medium and large, equivalent to [[Band society|bands]], [[Kinship|cultural lineage groups]] and [[tribe]]s\u2014with respective size ranges of 30\u201350, 100\u2013200 and 500\u20132500 members each.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar's surveys of village and tribe sizes also appeared to approximate this predicted value, including 150 as the estimated size of a [[Neolithic]] farming village; 150 as the splitting point of [[Hutterite]] settlements; 200 as the upper bound on the number of academics in a discipline's sub-specialisation; 150 as the basic unit size of professional [[army|armies]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman antiquity]] and in [[modern world|modern times]] since the 16th century; and notions of appropriate [[Company (military unit)|company]] size.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar has argued that 150 would be the mean group size only for communities with a very high incentive to remain together. For a group of this size to remain cohesive, Dunbar speculated that as much as 42% of the group's time would have to be devoted to social grooming. Correspondingly, only groups under intense survival pressure,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} such as [[subsistence farming|subsistence]] villages, [[nomad]]ic tribes, and historical [[war|military]] groupings, have, on average, achieved the 150-member mark. Moreover, Dunbar noted that such groups are almost always physically close: \"[...] we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each other, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.\" Thus, the 150-member group would occur only because of absolute necessity\u2014due to intense environmental and economic pressures.\n\nDunbar, in ''[[Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language]]'', proposes furthermore that [[language]] may have arisen as a \"cheap\" means of social grooming, allowing early humans to maintain social cohesion efficiently. Without language, Dunbar speculates, humans would have to expend nearly half their time on social grooming, which would have made productive, cooperative effort nearly impossible. Language may have allowed societies to remain cohesive, while reducing the need for physical and social intimacy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |title=Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-36336-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674363366 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{ citation | first1 = Robin | last1 =  Dunbar | date = 2004 | journal = Review of General Psychology | number = 2 | pages = 100\u2013110 | title = Gossip in Evolutionary Perspective | url = http://attach.matita.net/ziorufus/Dunbar%20gossip.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-24 | volume = 8 | doi =  10.1037/1089-2680.8.2.100 | citeseerx =  10.1.1.530.9865 }}</ref> This result is confirmed by the mathematical formulation of the social brain hypothesis, that showed that it is unlikely that increased brain size would have led to large groups without the kind of complex communication that only language allows.<ref name=\":DavidBarrett1\">{{Cite journal|last = D\u00e1vid-Barrett|first = T.|last2 = Dunbar|first2 = R.

Many primates that eat specialized diets that rely on scarce food have evolved small brains to conserve nutrients and are limited to living in small groups or even alone, and they lower average brain size for solitary or small group primates. Small-brained species of primate that are living in large groups are successfully predicted by diet theory to be the species that eat food that is abundant but not very nutritious. Along with the existence of complex deception in small-brained primates in large groups with the opportunity (both abundant food eaters in their natural environments and originally solitary species that adopted social lifestyles under artificial food abundances), this is cited as evidence against the model of social groups selecting for large brains and/or intelligence.<ref>Alex R.

Such social groups function as protective [[clique]]s within the physical groups in which the primates live. The number of social group members a primate can track appears to be limited by the volume of the neocortex.  This suggests that there is a species-specific index of the social group size, computable from the species' mean neocortical volume.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1992,<ref name=\"dunbar92\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Dunbar | first1 = R.

Using a regression equation on data for 38 primate [[genera]], Dunbar predicted a human \"mean group size\" of 148 (casually rounded to 150), a result he considered exploratory due to the large error measure (a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 230).<ref name=\"dunbar92\"/>\n\nDunbar then compared this prediction with observable group sizes for humans.  Beginning with the assumption that the current mean size of the human neocortex had developed about 250,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], Dunbar searched the [[anthropological]] and [[ethnographical]] literature for census-like group size information for various [[hunter\u2013gatherer]] societies, the closest existing approximations to how anthropology reconstructs the Pleistocene societies. Dunbar noted that the groups fell into three categories\u2014small, medium and large, equivalent to [[Band society|bands]], [[Kinship|cultural lineage groups]] and [[tribe]]s\u2014with respective size ranges of 30\u201350, 100\u2013200 and 500\u20132500 members each.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar's surveys of village and tribe sizes also appeared to approximate this predicted value, including 150 as the estimated size of a [[Neolithic]] farming village; 150 as the splitting point of [[Hutterite]] settlements; 200 as the upper bound on the number of academics in a discipline's sub-specialisation; 150 as the basic unit size of professional [[army|armies]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman antiquity]] and in [[modern world|modern times]] since the 16th century; and notions of appropriate [[Company (military unit)|company]] size.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nDunbar has argued that 150 would be the mean group size only for communities with a very high incentive to remain together. For a group of this size to remain cohesive, Dunbar speculated that as much as 42% of the group's time would have to be devoted to social grooming. Correspondingly, only groups under intense survival pressure,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} such as [[subsistence farming|subsistence]] villages, [[nomad]]ic tribes, and historical [[war|military]] groupings, have, on average, achieved the 150-member mark. Moreover, Dunbar noted that such groups are almost always physically close: \"[...] we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each other, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.\" Thus, the 150-member group would occur only because of absolute necessity\u2014due to intense environmental and economic pressures.\n\nDunbar, in ''[[Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language]]'', proposes furthermore that [[language]] may have arisen as a \"cheap\" means of social grooming, allowing early humans to maintain social cohesion efficiently. Without language, Dunbar speculates, humans would have to expend nearly half their time on social grooming, which would have made productive, cooperative effort nearly impossible. Language may have allowed societies to remain cohesive, while reducing the need for physical and social intimacy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |title=Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-36336-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674363366 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{ citation | first1 = Robin | last1 =  Dunbar | date = 2004 | journal = Review of General Psychology | number = 2 | pages = 100\u2013110 | title = Gossip in Evolutionary Perspective | url = http://attach.matita.net/ziorufus/Dunbar%20gossip.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-24 | volume = 8 | doi =  10.1037/1089-2680.8.2.100 | citeseerx =  10.1.1.530.9865 }}</ref> This result is confirmed by the mathematical formulation of the social brain hypothesis, that showed that it is unlikely that increased brain size would have led to large groups without the kind of complex communication that only language allows.<ref name=\":DavidBarrett1\">{{Cite journal|last = D\u00e1vid-Barrett|first = T.|last2 = Dunbar|first2 = R.

Many primates that eat specialized diets that rely on scarce food have evolved small brains to conserve nutrients and are limited to living in small groups or even alone, and they lower average brain size for solitary or small group primates. Small-brained species of primate that are living in large groups are successfully predicted by diet theory to be the species that eat food that is abundant but not very nutritious. Along with the existence of complex deception in small-brained primates in large groups with the opportunity (both abundant food eaters in their natural environments and originally solitary species that adopted social lifestyles under artificial food abundances), this is cited as evidence against the model of social groups selecting for large brains and/or intelligence.<ref>Alex R.

It has at times hosted the fastest express service between [[Manhattan]] and Coney Island, since there are no express stations along the entire stretch, but now carries only local trains on the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] service, which serves the entire line at all times. The line north of [[86th Street (BMT Sea Beach Line)|86th Street]] is also served by a few [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains during rush hours in the peak direction.\n\n==Extent and service==\nThe following services use part or all of the BMT Sea Beach Line:<ref>{{NYCS const|serviceguide}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Time period\n!Section of line\n|-\n|{{rint|newyork|N}}\n|all times\n|full line\n|-\n|{{rint|newyork|W}}\n|three rush hour trains<br/>in the peak direction\n|north of [[86th Street (BMT Sea Beach Line)|86th Street]]\n|}\n[[File:N approaching 6 Av in BR trench jeh.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Open cut, looking west from 6th Avenue overpass, with the LIRR [[Bay Ridge Branch]] on the left and the BMT Sea Beach Line on the right.]]\n[[File:16th Av powerhouse Sea Beach jeh.JPG|left|thumb|225px|16th Avenue powerhouse]]\n\n===Route description===\n\nThe modern line begins as a split from the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] at a [[flying junction]] immediately south of [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. Between the station and the split, [[Crossover (rail)|crossover switches]] are provided between the local and express tracks of the Fourth Avenue Line, and then the express tracks curve east under the northbound local track to become the beginning of the Sea Beach Line. After emerging from the tunnel under Fourth Avenue, the two separate Sea Beach tracks rise on either side of a ramp which formerly connected to the original line to the Brooklyn shore at 65th Street in [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]].<ref name=\"tracks\">{{NYCS const|trackref|trackbook3}}</ref>\n\nAfter passing the former junction with the line to the shore, the Sea Beach widens to the width of four tracks. All stations have two side platforms with no platform access to the express tracks anywhere on the Sea Beach right-of-way.<ref name=\"tracks\" />\n\nBefore and after [[Kings Highway (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Kings Highway]], there are crossover switches to the southbound express track from the northbound express track. On both sides of Kings Highway, crossovers exist to allow express trains to switch to the local tracks before the station or local trains to switch to express after the station. The express tracks end south of [[86th Street (BMT Sea Beach Line)|86th Street]] as the line becomes double-tracked, and cut diagonally adjacent to the [[Coney Island Complex|Coney Island Yards]]. After several [[railroad yard|yard]] connections, the line ends at the [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue (New York City Subway)|Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue]] terminal.<ref name=\"tracks\" />\n\n===Express tracks===\n\nThe express tracks were originally intended to host the ''Coney Island Express''. Service was carried on these tracks twice in the line's history &mdash; for summer weekend service to [[Chambers Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Chambers Street]] from 1924\u20131952 and again from 1967-1968 to provide a fast rush-hour [[BMT Broadway Line|Broadway Line]] express service for Coney Island riders ([[NX (New York City Subway service)|NX]]). Though these expresses are thought of as being Sea Beach Expresses, they did not serve a single station on the Sea Beach Line.\n\nThe express tracks on the Sea Beach had other uses over the years. Most new equipment, especially experimental cars, was broken in on these tracks. The tracks were used for [[Motorman (locomotive)|motorman]] training and set up with a short stretch of 1950s-era [[automation]] to test the ill-fated system later used on one track of the [[IRT 42nd Street Shuttle]].\n\nHistorically, the two express tracks were an absolute block, that is, there was no signal control between one end of the tracks near Sixth Avenue and [[Kings Highway (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Kings Highway]]. A train was not supposed to enter the block until any train in front of it had departed the block.\n\nThe express tracks' section on this block was allowed to deteriorate severely as did much of the system from the 1970s on. In 1998, it was decided to rehabilitate the express tracks in this area, with full signaling. Only the northbound (E4) track was rehabilitated, however, for two-way traffic from its northern end to Kings Highway if needed. The southbound (E3) track remains unused, being disconnected from the other three tracks and inaccessible from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to Kings Highway.<ref name=\"tracks\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Bmt triplex no 4.png|thumb|90px|Route designation on BMT Triplex equipment|alt=]]\n\nThe '''New York and Sea Beach Railroad''' was organized on September 25, 1876 as a [[steam-powered]] excursion railroad. It opened from a junction with the [[Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad]] (West End Line) and concurrently-opened [[New York, Bay Ridge and Jamaica Railroad]] (Manhattan Beach Line) to Coney Island on July 18, 1877.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=Another Line Open|date = 17 July 1877|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=The Sea Beach Railroad|date = 19 July 1877|page=2}}</ref> After a delay of two years, it was opened to the Bay Ridge Ferry (to [[South Ferry, Manhattan]]) on July 17, 1879, at which time the Sea Beach Palace opened at the Coney Island end.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=Sea Beach|date = 15 July 1879|page=2}}</ref><!--the only station mentioned is \"Gunther's Junction\", earlier called \"Bay Ridge Junction\"--><ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=The First Train|date = 17 July 1879|page=4}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 2015|title=Two Anniversaries\u2013Sea Beach and Steinway Tunnel|url=https://issuu.com/erausa/docs/2015-08-bulletin|journal=New York Division Bulletin|publisher=New York Division, Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=58|issue=8|doi=|pmid=|access-date=August 31, 2016|via=Issu}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Station AvenueU.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Station headhouse at [[Avenue U (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Avenue U]] station.]]\n\nExcept at its two ends, the railroad used the same route as the current Sea Beach Line. At the Bay Ridge end, the railroad ran just north of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s Bay Ridge Branch, ending at the Bay Ridge Channel around 64th Street. The current line joins this alignment near Fifth Avenue. The old railroad crossed the Bay Ridge Branch with a pronounced S-curve just east of Seventh Avenue; the crossing is now much straighter with the Bay Ridge Branch in a deeper cut. On the Coney Island end, the original path curved left soon after the curve to the right at the northern edge of the Coney Island Yards, ending at the combined Sea Beach Palace hotel and depot, on the north side of the [[BMT Brighton Line]] at around West 10th Street.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn May 22, 1883, the company was reorganized as the New York and Sea Beach Railway Company and was allowed to operate from New York Harbor to the Sea Beach Palace in Coney Island. The company went bankrupt, and a receiver was appointed on January 15, 1896, before the company was sold at foreclosure by the '''Sea Beach Railway''', which was incorporated on August 29, 1896. The [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company]] (BRT) bought the company's stock on November 5, 1897, along with the short [[elevated railway|elevated]] Sea View Railway on Coney Island, and assigned it by lease to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad. It was soon fitted with [[overhead lines|trolley wire]] for electric operation. A March 1, 1907 agreement allowed the company to operate through service from 38th Street and New Utrecht Avenue to Coney Island. Starting around 1908, electric trains began operating as a branch of the [[BMT West End Line]] from [[Bath Junction]] to Coney Island, with trains coming from [[Park Row (BMT station)|Park Row]] in Manhattan via the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and [[BMT Fifth Avenue Line]]. [[Streetcar]]s ran over the rest of the line to Bay Ridge, from New Utrecht Avenue and 62nd Street to 65th Street and Third Avenue. In 1907, connecting tracks were built connecting to the West End Line just north of [[Coney Island Creek]] in order to bring Sea Beach trains into [[West End Terminal|West End Depot]]. The original alignment was retained for freight service only.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe portion of the line between 62nd Street and New Utrecht Avenue and Third Avenue and 65th Street was replaced by bus service between December 1, 1913 and June 23, 1914, when trolley service resumed service before being eliminated on June 22, 1915.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Sea Beach Line.png|thumb|200px|Part of a 1915 brochure for the line|alt=]]\n\nAs part of the [[Dual Contracts]], and while the Fourth Avenue Subway Line was being constructed the BRT dug a four-track open cut and built high-level platforms for subway operation on the Sea Beach Line. Trolley cars started using the new open cut between Avenue T and 86th Street on January 9, 1914. Service was gradually extended until the new Sea Beach Line opened for full subway service. Two subway cars with poles were run between Third Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue and started operating on March 16, 1915. Additional cars were equipped with poles and operated service on the line from May 1, 1915 until the line opened for full subway service on June 22, 1915, with trains running between Coney Island and [[Chambers Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Chambers Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. Service started with two- and three-car trains operating via the Fourth Avenue local track and the Manhattan Bridge south tracks. The express tracks were finished several weeks later. When the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] was extended south from the Sea Beach Line on January 15, 1916, the Sea Beach trains were shifted to the express tracks on Fourth Avenue, with Fourth Avenue trains providing local service.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe tracks over the north side of the [[Manhattan Bridge]] opened on September 4, 1917, along with part of the [[BMT Broadway Line]]. All Sea Beach service was moved to the new line, ending at [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (New York City Subway)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1917/09/05/archives/open-first-section-of-broadway-line-train-carrying-1000-passengers.html|title=OPEN FIRST SECTION OF BROADWAY LINE; Train Carrying 1,000 Passengers Runs from Fourteenth Street to Coney Island.REGULAR SERVICE BEGINSNew Road Is Expected to Relieve Old System of 15,000 PersonsDaily in Rush Hours.

It has at times hosted the fastest express service between [[Manhattan]] and Coney Island, since there are no express stations along the entire stretch, but now carries only local trains on the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] service, which serves the entire line at all times. The line north of [[86th Street (BMT Sea Beach Line)|86th Street]] is also served by a few [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains during rush hours in the peak direction.\n\n==Extent and service==\nThe following services use part or all of the BMT Sea Beach Line:<ref>{{NYCS const|serviceguide}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Time period\n!Section of line\n|-\n|{{rint|newyork|N}}\n|all times\n|full line\n|-\n|{{rint|newyork|W}}\n|three rush hour trains<br/>in the peak direction\n|north of [[86th Street (BMT Sea Beach Line)|86th Street]]\n|}\n[[File:N approaching 6 Av in BR trench jeh.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Open cut, looking west from 6th Avenue overpass, with the LIRR [[Bay Ridge Branch]] on the left and the BMT Sea Beach Line on the right.]]\n[[File:16th Av powerhouse Sea Beach jeh.JPG|left|thumb|225px|16th Avenue powerhouse]]\n\n===Route description===\n\nThe modern line begins as a split from the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] at a [[flying junction]] immediately south of [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. Between the station and the split, [[Crossover (rail)|crossover switches]] are provided between the local and express tracks of the Fourth Avenue Line, and then the express tracks curve east under the northbound local track to become the beginning of the Sea Beach Line. After emerging from the tunnel under Fourth Avenue, the two separate Sea Beach tracks rise on either side of a ramp which formerly connected to the original line to the Brooklyn shore at 65th Street in [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]].<ref name=\"tracks\">{{NYCS const|trackref|trackbook3}}</ref>\n\nAfter passing the former junction with the line to the shore, the Sea Beach widens to the width of four tracks. All stations have two side platforms with no platform access to the express tracks anywhere on the Sea Beach right-of-way.<ref name=\"tracks\" />\n\nBefore and after [[Kings Highway (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Kings Highway]], there are crossover switches to the southbound express track from the northbound express track. On both sides of Kings Highway, crossovers exist to allow express trains to switch to the local tracks before the station or local trains to switch to express after the station. The express tracks end south of [[86th Street (BMT Sea Beach Line)|86th Street]] as the line becomes double-tracked, and cut diagonally adjacent to the [[Coney Island Complex|Coney Island Yards]]. After several [[railroad yard|yard]] connections, the line ends at the [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue (New York City Subway)|Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue]] terminal.<ref name=\"tracks\" />\n\n===Express tracks===\n\nThe express tracks were originally intended to host the ''Coney Island Express''. Service was carried on these tracks twice in the line's history &mdash; for summer weekend service to [[Chambers Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Chambers Street]] from 1924\u20131952 and again from 1967-1968 to provide a fast rush-hour [[BMT Broadway Line|Broadway Line]] express service for Coney Island riders ([[NX (New York City Subway service)|NX]]). Though these expresses are thought of as being Sea Beach Expresses, they did not serve a single station on the Sea Beach Line.\n\nThe express tracks on the Sea Beach had other uses over the years. Most new equipment, especially experimental cars, was broken in on these tracks. The tracks were used for [[Motorman (locomotive)|motorman]] training and set up with a short stretch of 1950s-era [[automation]] to test the ill-fated system later used on one track of the [[IRT 42nd Street Shuttle]].\n\nHistorically, the two express tracks were an absolute block, that is, there was no signal control between one end of the tracks near Sixth Avenue and [[Kings Highway (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Kings Highway]]. A train was not supposed to enter the block until any train in front of it had departed the block.\n\nThe express tracks' section on this block was allowed to deteriorate severely as did much of the system from the 1970s on. In 1998, it was decided to rehabilitate the express tracks in this area, with full signaling. Only the northbound (E4) track was rehabilitated, however, for two-way traffic from its northern end to Kings Highway if needed. The southbound (E3) track remains unused, being disconnected from the other three tracks and inaccessible from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to Kings Highway.<ref name=\"tracks\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Bmt triplex no 4.png|thumb|90px|Route designation on BMT Triplex equipment|alt=]]\n\nThe '''New York and Sea Beach Railroad''' was organized on September 25, 1876 as a [[steam-powered]] excursion railroad. It opened from a junction with the [[Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad]] (West End Line) and concurrently-opened [[New York, Bay Ridge and Jamaica Railroad]] (Manhattan Beach Line) to Coney Island on July 18, 1877.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=Another Line Open|date = 17 July 1877|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=The Sea Beach Railroad|date = 19 July 1877|page=2}}</ref> After a delay of two years, it was opened to the Bay Ridge Ferry (to [[South Ferry, Manhattan]]) on July 17, 1879, at which time the Sea Beach Palace opened at the Coney Island end.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=Sea Beach|date = 15 July 1879|page=2}}</ref><!--the only station mentioned is \"Gunther's Junction\", earlier called \"Bay Ridge Junction\"--><ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url = |title=The First Train|date = 17 July 1879|page=4}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 2015|title=Two Anniversaries\u2013Sea Beach and Steinway Tunnel|url=https://issuu.com/erausa/docs/2015-08-bulletin|journal=New York Division Bulletin|publisher=New York Division, Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=58|issue=8|doi=|pmid=|access-date=August 31, 2016|via=Issu}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Station AvenueU.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Station headhouse at [[Avenue U (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Avenue U]] station.]]\n\nExcept at its two ends, the railroad used the same route as the current Sea Beach Line. At the Bay Ridge end, the railroad ran just north of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s Bay Ridge Branch, ending at the Bay Ridge Channel around 64th Street. The current line joins this alignment near Fifth Avenue. The old railroad crossed the Bay Ridge Branch with a pronounced S-curve just east of Seventh Avenue; the crossing is now much straighter with the Bay Ridge Branch in a deeper cut. On the Coney Island end, the original path curved left soon after the curve to the right at the northern edge of the Coney Island Yards, ending at the combined Sea Beach Palace hotel and depot, on the north side of the [[BMT Brighton Line]] at around West 10th Street.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn May 22, 1883, the company was reorganized as the New York and Sea Beach Railway Company and was allowed to operate from New York Harbor to the Sea Beach Palace in Coney Island. The company went bankrupt, and a receiver was appointed on January 15, 1896, before the company was sold at foreclosure by the '''Sea Beach Railway''', which was incorporated on August 29, 1896. The [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company]] (BRT) bought the company's stock on November 5, 1897, along with the short [[elevated railway|elevated]] Sea View Railway on Coney Island, and assigned it by lease to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad. It was soon fitted with [[overhead lines|trolley wire]] for electric operation. A March 1, 1907 agreement allowed the company to operate through service from 38th Street and New Utrecht Avenue to Coney Island. Starting around 1908, electric trains began operating as a branch of the [[BMT West End Line]] from [[Bath Junction]] to Coney Island, with trains coming from [[Park Row (BMT station)|Park Row]] in Manhattan via the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and [[BMT Fifth Avenue Line]]. [[Streetcar]]s ran over the rest of the line to Bay Ridge, from New Utrecht Avenue and 62nd Street to 65th Street and Third Avenue. In 1907, connecting tracks were built connecting to the West End Line just north of [[Coney Island Creek]] in order to bring Sea Beach trains into [[West End Terminal|West End Depot]]. The original alignment was retained for freight service only.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe portion of the line between 62nd Street and New Utrecht Avenue and Third Avenue and 65th Street was replaced by bus service between December 1, 1913 and June 23, 1914, when trolley service resumed service before being eliminated on June 22, 1915.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Sea Beach Line.png|thumb|200px|Part of a 1915 brochure for the line|alt=]]\n\nAs part of the [[Dual Contracts]], and while the Fourth Avenue Subway Line was being constructed the BRT dug a four-track open cut and built high-level platforms for subway operation on the Sea Beach Line. Trolley cars started using the new open cut between Avenue T and 86th Street on January 9, 1914. Service was gradually extended until the new Sea Beach Line opened for full subway service. Two subway cars with poles were run between Third Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue and started operating on March 16, 1915. Additional cars were equipped with poles and operated service on the line from May 1, 1915 until the line opened for full subway service on June 22, 1915, with trains running between Coney Island and [[Chambers Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Chambers Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. Service started with two- and three-car trains operating via the Fourth Avenue local track and the Manhattan Bridge south tracks. The express tracks were finished several weeks later. When the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] was extended south from the Sea Beach Line on January 15, 1916, the Sea Beach trains were shifted to the express tracks on Fourth Avenue, with Fourth Avenue trains providing local service.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe tracks over the north side of the [[Manhattan Bridge]] opened on September 4, 1917, along with part of the [[BMT Broadway Line]]. All Sea Beach service was moved to the new line, ending at [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (New York City Subway)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1917/09/05/archives/open-first-section-of-broadway-line-train-carrying-1000-passengers.html|title=OPEN FIRST SECTION OF BROADWAY LINE; Train Carrying 1,000 Passengers Runs from Fourteenth Street to Coney Island.REGULAR SERVICE BEGINSNew Road Is Expected to Relieve Old System of 15,000 PersonsDaily in Rush Hours.

The ''Sea Beach Line'' service became the [[BMT 4|4]]. This has since become the {{NYCS service|N}} train. In general, Sea Beach service has always run express in Manhattan and on Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, ending at 42nd Street and later [[57th Street \u2013 Seventh Avenue (BMT Broadway Line)|57th Street]]. The {{NYCS service|NX}} began on November 27, 1967 as a \"super-express\" from [[Brighton Beach (BMT Brighton Line)|Brighton Beach]] on the [[BMT Brighton Line]] through [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue (New York City Subway)|Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue]], and along the Sea Beach Line express tracks to 57th Street with only seven stops between Stillwell Avenue and 57th Street, three in Brooklyn and four in Manhattan. This service was discontinued on April 15, 1968 due to low ridership, and no regular trains have used the Sea Beach express tracks since.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejoekorner.com/lines/suball-frame.htm|title=SUBWAY LINE NAMES|last=Korman|first=Joseph D.|date=|website=www.thejoekorner.com|publisher=|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"erictb.info2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.erictb.info/linehistory.html|title=NYCT Line by Line History|last=Bolden|first=Eric|date=|publisher=|access-date=October 30, 2016|work=erictb.info}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thejoekorner.com/scripted-ticket-display.shtm?http://www.thejoekorner.com/subway-sun/P008486.gif service notice], effective April 15, 1968</ref>\n\n===Later years===\n\nIn the 1970s, there was a proposal to renovate the Sea Beach open cut, which were deteriorating to the point that a retaining wall along the line was in danger of collapsing onto the tracks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/28/archives/subway-repairs-voted-by-city-east-river-duct-work.html|title=Subway Repairs Voted By City|last=Fowler|first=Glenn|date=1974-04-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Funding was allocated for the line's infrastructure improvements in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/19/archives/subway-improvements-set-by-mta.html|title=Subway Improvements Set by M.T.A.|last=Burks|first=Edward C.|date=1975-10-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> More than $20 million was earmarked for New York City Subway projects in 1977, including for upgrades to the Sea Beach line.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/04/archives/mta-receives-280-million-in-federal-grants.html|title=M.T.A.
