Although the city of Rome was occupied by Germany from 1943 and the Allies from 1944, [[Vatican City]] itself was not occupied. The Vatican organised extensive humanitarian aid throughout the duration of the conflict.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vatican City]] came into existence in 1929, a decade before the start of World War II]]\n\nThe [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 with Italy recognized the sovereignty of Vatican City. It declared Vatican City a [[neutral country]] in [[international relations]], and required the Pope to abstain from mediation unless requested by all parties. In 1939, the city state was [[Foreign relations of Pope Pius XII|recognized by thirty-eight nations]], with a [[diplomatic corps]] of thirteen full ambassadors and twenty-five ministers.<ref>Morley, 1980, page 8</ref>\n\n==Foreign relations==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Pope Pius XII}}\n\n===Pre-war mediation attempts===\nAs early as April 1939, Pius XII announced a plan for peace, hoping to mediate a negotiation between the major European powers on the brink of war.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, p. 61</ref> The first leader contacted was [[Benito Mussolini]], via Pius XII's usual go-between, Jesuit Father [[Tacchi Venturi]].<ref name=\"c62\">Chadwick, 1988, p. 62</ref> With Mussolini's approval, the next day Cardinal Secretary of State [[Luigi Maglione]] contacted the [[nuncio]]s in Paris ([[Valerio Valeri]]), Warsaw ([[Filippo Cortesi]]), and Berlin ([[Cesare Orsenigo]]) and the Apostolic Delegate in London ([[William Godfrey]]).<ref name=\"c62\"/> The proposed Vatican meeting accomplished very little of substance: if there was any coherent position espoused by the Vatican among its various communications, it was that of [[appeasement]].<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 62-74</ref> In particular, the Pope attempted to get Poland to accept the secession of the [[Free City of Danzig]] to Nazi Germany, a position Polish ambassador [[Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e]] (the former High Commissioner of Danzig) and the Polish government could not accept.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 75-76</ref>\n[[File:Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e.PNG|thumb|right|Polish ambassador to the Vatican, [[Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e]], was critical of Pius XII's pre-war mediation efforts.]]\n\nIn his 24 August 1939 Radio Message, just a week before war, Pius warned: \"The danger is imminent, but there is still time.

The similarly minded US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] re-established American diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a seventy-year hiatus and dispatched [[Myron C. Taylor]] as his personal representative. Despite the early collapse of peace hopes, the Taylor mission continued at the Vatican.<ref>[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/VATICAN1.HTML Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum - ''The Vatican Files'']</ref>\n\n===Public statements===\nDespite intense behind the scenes actions, Pius XII was resolved not to issue any public pronouncement that took sides in the conflict; this first manifested itself in a refusal to explicitly condemn the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]].<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 79-81</ref> Early on, Pius XII believed that the \"rapid destruction of Poland meant the end of the war\".<ref>Chadwick, 1988, p. 82</ref>\n\n====Outbreak of war====\n''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' (\"On the Limitations of the Authority of the State\"), issued 20 October 1939, was the first papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, and established some of the themes of his papacy.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236596 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica - Reflections on the Holocaust'']</ref> According to Chadwick, ''Summi Pontificatus'' exemplified both \"the hesitancy and the care\" of the pontiff.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, p. 83</ref>  During the drafting of the letter, the Second World War commenced with the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Catholic Poland.

Pius avoided naming the belligerent allies [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] as the evildoers, establishing the \"impartial\" public tone that was to be a hallmark of his pontificate: \"A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html ''SUMMI PONTIFICATUS'' - Section 28]</ref>\n\n====Resistance====\nThe Pope wrote of \"anti-Christian movements\" bringing forth a crop \"poignant disasters\" and called for love, mercy, and compassion against the \"deluge of discord\".

The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|British envoy D'Arcy Osborne]], channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with Britain, and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.<ref name=\"John Toland p.760\">John Toland; ''Hitler''; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p.760</ref>\n\nNegotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime. Hoffmann wrote that, when the [[Venlo Incident]] stalled the talks, the British agreed to resume discussions primarily because of the \"efforts of the Pope and the respect in which he was held. Chamberlain and Halifax set great store by the Pope's readiness to mediate.\"<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> Pius, without offering endorsement, advised Osbourne on 11 January 1940 that the German opposition had said that a German offensive was planned for February, but that this could be averted if the German generals could be assured of peace with Britain, and not on punitive terms. If this could be assured, then they were willing to move to replace Hitler. The Pope admitted to \"discomfort\" at his role as mediator, but advised that the Germans involved were not Nazis. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. On 7 February, the Pope updated Osbourne that the opposition wanted to replace the Nazi regime with a democratic federation, but hoped to retain Austria and the Sudetenland. The British government was non-committal, and said that while the federal model was of interest, the promises and sources of the opposition were too vague. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160-163</ref>\n\nChadwick wrote that Pius XII met with D'Arcy Osborne, telling him that he knew the names of the involved German generals but did not wish to share them.<ref name=\"c90\">Chadwick, 1988, p. 90</ref> Pius XII insisted to Osborne that he was merely passing on a message and that \"he did not wish in the slightest degree to endorse it or to recommend it\".<ref name=\"c90\"/> When Osborne pressed the Pope on the vagueness of his message, Osborne reported that Pius XII replied \"perhaps, after all, it was not worth proceeding with the matter and he would therefore ask me to return his communication to me as not having been made\".<ref name=\"c90\"/> The Pope further declined Osborne's request to guarantee the good faith of the generals, or whether they could accomplish their goal.<ref name=\"c90\"/> In a second meeting, Pius XII flashed a typed, four-page letter in German in front of Osborne, but declined to let him read it or have a copy.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 91-96</ref>\n\nAfter the German attack on Denmark and Norway, the British refused any further contacts with emissaries of the German military opposition, fearing another [[Venlo incident]]. The opposition largely dissolved after the German conquest of France in summer 1940 because Halder no longer dared to stand up against an apparently successful Hitler. It only regained momentum in 1944 when a new generation of younger officers decided to conspire against the ruthless Nazi regime. Leiber remained the point of contact at the Vatican for communications from Colonel-General [[Ludwig Beck]] in the lead up to the 1944 [[July Plot]].<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.161 & 294\" />\n\n===Mid-war===\nIn late 1942, senior Italian officials first approached the Vatican with peace feelers.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 246-47</ref> In the eyes of the Vatican, \"the neutrality of the Vatican, achieved at such cost, was paying a dividend at last\".<ref>Chadwick, 1988, p. 248</ref> When Mussolini sent his son-in-law, [[Count Ciano]], as ambassador to the Vatican in 1943, the Germans and others speculated about the possibility of Ciano negotiating a separate peace.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 248-49</ref> The British for their part doubted any such intentions and wanted nothing to do with Ciano.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 249-50</ref>\n\n==Military history==\nThe Vatican maintained a small force of troops known as the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]].

In the Vatican itself, 477 Jews were sheltered . As German round-ups continued in Northern Italy, the Pope opened his summer residence, [[Castel Gandolfo]], to take in thousands of Jews, and authorized institutions across the north to do the same.<ref name=\"spectator.org\"/>\n\nFrom 1943, Pius instructed his Bulgarian representative to take \"all necessary steps\" to support Bulgarian Jews facing deportation, and his Turkish nuncio, [[Angelo Roncalli]] (later Pope John XXIII) arranged for the transfer of thousands of children out of Bulgaria to Palestine.<ref name=\"spectator.org\"/> Roncalli also advised the Pope of Jewish concentration camps in Romanian-occupied [[Transnistria]]. The Pope protested to the Romanian government and authorized for funds to be sent to the camps.<ref name=\"spectator.org\"/> In 1944 Pius appealed directly to the Hungarian government to halt the deportation of the Jews of Hungary and his nuncio, [[Angelo Rotta]], led a citywide rescue scheme in Budapest.<ref name=\"spectator.org\"/><ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf</ref>\n\nUpon his death, Pius was praised emphatically by Israel and world leaders for his wartime leadership.

The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|British envoy D'Arcy Osborne]], channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with Britain, and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.<ref name=\"John Toland p.760\">John Toland; ''Hitler''; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p.760</ref>\n\nNegotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime. Hoffmann wrote that, when the [[Venlo Incident]] stalled the talks, the British agreed to resume discussions primarily because of the \"efforts of the Pope and the respect in which he was held. Chamberlain and Halifax set great store by the Pope's readiness to mediate.\"<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> Pius, without offering endorsement, advised Osbourne on 11 January 1940 that the German opposition had said that a German offensive was planned for February, but that this could be averted if the German generals could be assured of peace with Britain, and not on punitive terms. If this could be assured, then they were willing to move to replace Hitler. The Pope admitted to \"discomfort\" at his role as mediator, but advised that the Germans involved were not Nazis. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. On 7 February, the Pope updated Osbourne that the opposition wanted to replace the Nazi regime with a democratic federation, but hoped to retain Austria and the Sudetenland. The British government was non-committal, and said that while the federal model was of interest, the promises and sources of the opposition were too vague. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160-163</ref>\n\nChadwick wrote that Pius XII met with D'Arcy Osborne, telling him that he knew the names of the involved German generals but did not wish to share them.<ref name=\"c90\">Chadwick, 1988, p. 90</ref> Pius XII insisted to Osborne that he was merely passing on a message and that \"he did not wish in the slightest degree to endorse it or to recommend it\".<ref name=\"c90\"/> When Osborne pressed the Pope on the vagueness of his message, Osborne reported that Pius XII replied \"perhaps, after all, it was not worth proceeding with the matter and he would therefore ask me to return his communication to me as not having been made\".<ref name=\"c90\"/> The Pope further declined Osborne's request to guarantee the good faith of the generals, or whether they could accomplish their goal.<ref name=\"c90\"/> In a second meeting, Pius XII flashed a typed, four-page letter in German in front of Osborne, but declined to let him read it or have a copy.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 91-96</ref>\n\nAfter the German attack on Denmark and Norway, the British refused any further contacts with emissaries of the German military opposition, fearing another [[Venlo incident]]. The opposition largely dissolved after the German conquest of France in summer 1940 because Halder no longer dared to stand up against an apparently successful Hitler. It only regained momentum in 1944 when a new generation of younger officers decided to conspire against the ruthless Nazi regime.

EI132 was an [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] aircraft, owned and operated by the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] airline [[Aer Lingus]], destined for [[Shannon Airport|Shannon, Ireland]], and carrying 12 crew members and 260 passengers.  US1170 was a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft owned by Wells Fargo Bank Northwest NA and operated by [[US Airways]], destined for [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and carrying 6 crew members and 103 passengers.  The near collision took place on the runway at [[General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport]] (BOS), in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. In total 381 people were on board the two aircraft.\n\n==Incident==\n[[File:BOS airfield map.png|thumb|left|[[Runway]] layout at Logan Airport at the time of the incident. Runway 15R runs from top left to bottom right, while runway 9 runs from lower center to mid-right]]\nTo reduce radio congestion and consequences resulting from pilot or controller error, airports with a large number of operations will typically split the [[Air Traffic Control|tower (local) controller]] into two or more positions. This was the case that evening when each of the incident flights were the responsibility of different controllers. The local control west controller was responsible for Aer Lingus Flight 132 and the local control east controller was responsible for US Airways flight 1170.<ref name=ntsb/>\n\nAt 19:39:10, Aer Lingus Flight 132 was cleared for takeoff from runway 15R by local control west. Five seconds later, local control east cleared US Airways Flight 1170 for takeoff from runway 9 which intersects with runway 15R; the aircraft had essentially been sent on a collision course. With the airport terminals between the two aircraft as the takeoffs began, the flight crews could not initially see each other.<ref name=ntsb/>\n\nDuring the take-off roll, the US Airways [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] noticed the other plane and realized that they could collide. He realized that at the runway intersection both aircraft would be slightly airborne. Telling the Captain to \"keep it down\", he pushed the control column forward. He was able to keep the aircraft from lifting off the runway, allowing it to reach the intersection and pass under the other aircraft as it took off. The two planes passed within an estimated {{convert|70|ft|m}} of each other, with the Aer Lingus aircraft flying over the US Airways aircraft. According to the NTSB report, the US Airways flight had already achieved its [[V1 speed|V<sub>1</sub> speed]] and could no longer safely abort takeoff, therefore the flight crew continued down the runway and lifted off after passing through the intersection.<ref name=ntsb/><ref name=\"Alpa\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alpa.org/DesktopModules/ALPA_Documents/ALPA_DocumentsDownload.aspx?itemid=4310&ModuleId=2618 |title=Alpa release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055709/http://www.alpa.org/DesktopModules/ALPA_Documents/ALPA_DocumentsDownload.aspx?itemid=4310&ModuleId=2618 |archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Superior Airmanship Award==\n[[US Airways]] Captain Henry Jones and First Officer Jim Dannahower were later awarded a [[Superior Airmanship Award]] from the [[Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA) for their quick reactions and expert adjustment of their [[takeoff]] maneuver.<ref name=\"Alpa\" />\n\n==Probable cause==\n\nThe [[NTSB]] completed its investigation and found that the east tower controller had given the west tower controller permission for the Aer Lingus to depart on 15R.

EI132 was an [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] aircraft, owned and operated by the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] airline [[Aer Lingus]], destined for [[Shannon Airport|Shannon, Ireland]], and carrying 12 crew members and 260 passengers.  US1170 was a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft owned by Wells Fargo Bank Northwest NA and operated by [[US Airways]], destined for [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and carrying 6 crew members and 103 passengers.  The near collision took place on the runway at [[General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport]] (BOS), in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. In total 381 people were on board the two aircraft.\n\n==Incident==\n[[File:BOS airfield map.png|thumb|left|[[Runway]] layout at Logan Airport at the time of the incident. Runway 15R runs from top left to bottom right, while runway 9 runs from lower center to mid-right]]\nTo reduce radio congestion and consequences resulting from pilot or controller error, airports with a large number of operations will typically split the [[Air Traffic Control|tower (local) controller]] into two or more positions. This was the case that evening when each of the incident flights were the responsibility of different controllers. The local control west controller was responsible for Aer Lingus Flight 132 and the local control east controller was responsible for US Airways flight 1170.<ref name=ntsb/>\n\nAt 19:39:10, Aer Lingus Flight 132 was cleared for takeoff from runway 15R by local control west. Five seconds later, local control east cleared US Airways Flight 1170 for takeoff from runway 9 which intersects with runway 15R; the aircraft had essentially been sent on a collision course. With the airport terminals between the two aircraft as the takeoffs began, the flight crews could not initially see each other.<ref name=ntsb/>\n\nDuring the take-off roll, the US Airways [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] noticed the other plane and realized that they could collide. He realized that at the runway intersection both aircraft would be slightly airborne. Telling the Captain to \"keep it down\", he pushed the control column forward. He was able to keep the aircraft from lifting off the runway, allowing it to reach the intersection and pass under the other aircraft as it took off. The two planes passed within an estimated {{convert|70|ft|m}} of each other, with the Aer Lingus aircraft flying over the US Airways aircraft. According to the NTSB report, the US Airways flight had already achieved its [[V1 speed|V<sub>1</sub> speed]] and could no longer safely abort takeoff, therefore the flight crew continued down the runway and lifted off after passing through the intersection.<ref name=ntsb/><ref name=\"Alpa\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alpa.org/DesktopModules/ALPA_Documents/ALPA_DocumentsDownload.aspx?itemid=4310&ModuleId=2618 |title=Alpa release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055709/http://www.alpa.org/DesktopModules/ALPA_Documents/ALPA_DocumentsDownload.aspx?itemid=4310&ModuleId=2618 |archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Superior Airmanship Award==\n[[US Airways]] Captain Henry Jones and First Officer Jim Dannahower were later awarded a [[Superior Airmanship Award]] from the [[Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA) for their quick reactions and expert adjustment of their [[takeoff]] maneuver.<ref name=\"Alpa\" />\n\n==Probable cause==\n\nThe [[NTSB]] completed its investigation and found that the east tower controller had given the west tower controller permission for the Aer Lingus to depart on 15R. While coordinating other traffic, he forgot about releasing that aircraft and cleared the US Airways for takeoff. Local procedures required the east controller to wait until the departure on 15R had passed through the intersection before clearing the aircraft on runway 9 for takeoff.
