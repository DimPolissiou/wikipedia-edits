The video game industry was impacted by the outbreak in various ways, most often due to concerns over travel to and from China or elsewhere or related to slowdowns in the manufacturing processes within China.\n\n==Overview==\nIn contrast to [[Socio-economic impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|many other economic sectors that are drastically affected by the pandemic]], the video game industry was generally more resilient to the pandemic. Most video game developers, publishers and operators were able to maintain operations with employees working from home to sustain game development and digital releases. Further, with many people globally at home and unable to work, online gaming saw the record numbers of players during the pandemic as a popular activity to counter [[social distancing]], a practice recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]<ref name=\"who video games\"/> which helped to boost revenues for many companies.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/gaming/coronavirus-videogames-industry-impact/ |title = Game (still) on: How coronavirus is impacting the gaming industry | first = Nick | last=  Romero | date = March 19, 2020 | access-date = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html | title=  The world is turning to video games amid coronavirus outbreak | first= Daniel | last = Howley | date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Yahoo!]] }}</ref>\n\nThere were still negative impacts on the industry, notably with major trade events like the [[E3 2020]] cancelled or postponed which may impact relationships between the smaller developers and publishers. This particularly impacted [[indie developers]] who typically used these events for face-to-face meetings with potential partners to gain funding and publishing support, and required them to delay or cancel projects.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-08-what-does-a-year-without-events-mean-for-indies | title = What does a year without events mean for indies? | first = Ryland H. | last = Garnett | date = April 8, 2020 | accessdate = April 10, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Further, many esport leagues had to alter plans for their games, transitioning from live events to remote play or cancellation altogether. Portions of the sector that relied on physical products, such as retail stores and peripheral makers, as well as those dependent on in-person activities such as [[quality assurance]] through playtesting, ratings evaluation, and marketing, also struggled with global stay-at-home orders.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-09-the-games-industry-must-protect-its-vulnerable-businesses | title = The games industry must protect its vulnerable businesses | first=  Christopher | last = Dring | date = April 9, 2020 | accessdate = April 9, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the pandemic in China is also expected to impact the supply chains for electronics for the year which may limit hardware availability once the pandemic relaxed. This may impact plans for Microsoft and Sony to release their next-generation consoles, the [[Xbox Series X]] and [[PlayStation 5]] in the part of the year.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-51907663 | title = Animal Crossing, Warzone and the coronavirus impact | first=  Steffan | last=  Powell |date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[BBC]] }}</ref>\n\n==Events affected by pandemic==\n== Esports ==\nMost esports events are based on online games, but are typically played in local arenas to reduce network latency between players as well as to provide an audience.

Most video game developers, publishers and operators were able to maintain operations with employees working from home to sustain game development and digital releases.

Both definitions are given below.  In either case, one needs to choose the three lattice vectors '''a<sub>1</sub>''', '''a<sub>2</sub>''', and '''a<sub>3</sub>''' that define the unit cell (note that the conventional unit cell may be larger than the primitive cell of the [[Bravais lattice]], as the [[Miller_index#Case_of_cubic_structures|examples below]] illustrate). Given these, the three primitive reciprocal lattice vectors are also determined (denoted '''b<sub>1</sub>''', '''b<sub>2</sub>''', and '''b<sub>3</sub>''').\n\nThen, given the three Miller indices h, k, \u2113, (hk\u2113) denotes planes orthogonal to the reciprocal lattice vector:\n:<math> \\mathbf{g}_{hk\\ell} = h \\mathbf{b}_1 + k \\mathbf{b}_2 + \\ell \\mathbf{b}_3 .</math>\nThat is, (hk\u2113) simply indicates a normal to the planes in the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors.  Because the coordinates  are integers, this normal is itself always a reciprocal lattice vector.  The requirement of lowest terms means that it is the ''shortest'' reciprocal lattice vector in the given direction.\n\nEquivalently, (hk\u2113) denotes a plane that intercepts the three points '''a<sub>1</sub>'''/''h'', '''a<sub>2</sub>'''/''k'', and '''a<sub>3</sub>'''/''\u2113'', or some multiple thereof.  That is, the Miller indices are proportional to the ''inverses'' of the intercepts of the plane, in the basis of the lattice vectors.  If one of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis (the intercept is \"at infinity\").\n\nConsidering only (hk\u2113) planes intersecting one or more lattice points (the ''lattice planes''), the perpendicular distance ''d'' between adjacent lattice planes is related to the (shortest) reciprocal lattice vector orthogonal to the planes by the formula: <math>d = 2\\pi / |\\mathbf{g}_{h k \\ell}|</math>.<ref name=\"Ash\"/>\n\nThe related notation [hk\u2113] denotes the ''direction'':\n:<math>h \\mathbf{a}_1 + k \\mathbf{a}_2 + \\ell \\mathbf{a}_3 .</math>\nThat is, it uses the direct lattice basis instead of the reciprocal lattice.  Note that [hk\u2113] is ''not'' generally normal to the (hk\u2113) planes, except in a cubic lattice as described below.\n\n==Case of cubic structures==\nFor the special case of simple cubic crystals, the lattice vectors are orthogonal and of equal length (usually denoted ''a''), as are those of the reciprocal lattice.  Thus, in this common case, the Miller indices (hk\u2113) and [hk\u2113] both simply denote normals/directions in [[Cartesian coordinates]].\n\nFor cubic crystals with [[lattice constant]] ''a'', the spacing ''d'' between adjacent (hk\u2113) lattice planes is (from above)\n: <math>d_{hk \\ell}= \\frac {a} { \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + \\ell ^2} }</math>.\n\nBecause of the symmetry of cubic crystals, it is possible to change the place and sign of the integers and have equivalent directions and planes:\n*Indices in ''angle brackets'' such as \u27e8100\u27e9 denote a ''family'' of directions which are equivalent due to symmetry operations, such as [100], [010], [001] or the negative of any of those directions.\n*Indices in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as {100} denote a family of plane normals which are equivalent due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions.\n\nFor [[face-centered cubic]] and [[body-centered cubic]] lattices, the primitive lattice vectors are not orthogonal.  However, in these cases the Miller indices are conventionally defined relative to the lattice vectors of the cubic [[supercell (crystal)|supercell]] and hence are again simply the Cartesian directions.\n\n==Case of hexagonal and rhombohedral structures==\n\n[[Image:Miller-bravais.svg|thumb|Miller-Bravais indices]]\n\nWith [[hexagonal lattice system|hexagonal]] and [[rhombohedral lattice system|rhombohedral]] [[lattice system]]s, it is possible to use the '''Bravais-Miller''' system, which uses four indices (''h'' ''k'' ''i'' ''\u2113'') that obey the constraint\n: ''h'' + ''k'' + ''i'' = 0.\nHere ''h'', ''k'' and ''\u2113'' are identical to the corresponding Miller indices, and ''i'' is a redundant index.\n\nThis four-index scheme for labeling planes in a hexagonal lattice makes permutation symmetries apparent.  For example, the similarity between (110) \u2261 (11{{overline|2}}0) and (1{{overline|2}}0) \u2261 (1{{overline|2}}10) is more obvious when the redundant index is shown.\n\nIn the figure at right, the (001) plane has a 3-fold symmetry: it remains unchanged by a rotation of 1/3 (2\u03c0/3 rad, 120\u00b0). The [100], [010] and the [{{overline|1}}{{overline|1}}0] directions are really similar. If ''S'' is the intercept of the plane with the [{{overline|1}}{{overline|1}}0] axis, then\n: ''i'' = 1/''S''.\n\nThere are also ''[[ad hoc]]'' schemes (e.g. in the [[transmission electron microscopy]] literature) for indexing hexagonal ''lattice vectors'' (rather than reciprocal lattice vectors or planes) with four indices.  However they don't operate by similarly adding a redundant index to the regular three-index set.\n\nFor example, the reciprocal lattice vector (hk\u2113) as suggested above can be written in terms of reciprocal lattice vectors as <math>h\\mathbf{b_1} + k\\mathbf{b_2} + \\ell\\mathbf{b_3}</math>. For hexagonal crystals this may be expressed in terms of direct-lattice basis-vectors '''a<sub>1</sub>''', '''a<sub>2</sub>''' and '''a<sub>3</sub>''' as\n\n:<math>h\\mathbf{b_1} + k\\mathbf{b_2} + \\ell \\mathbf{b_3}= \\frac{2}{3 a^2}(2 h + k)\\mathbf{a_1} + \\frac{2}{3 a^2}(h+2k)\\mathbf{a_2} + \\frac{1}{c^2} (\\ell) \\mathbf{a_3}.</math>\n\nHence zone indices of the direction perpendicular to plane (hk\u2113) are, in suitably normalized triplet form, simply <math>[2h+k,h+2k,\\ell(3/2)(a/c)^2]</math>.  When ''four indices'' are used for the zone normal to plane (hk\u2113), however, the literature often uses <math>[h,k,-h-k,\\ell(3/2)(a/c)^2]</math> instead.<ref>J. W. Edington (1976) ''Practical electron microscopy in materials science'' (N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven) {{ISBN|1-878907-35-2}}, Appendix 2</ref>  Thus as you can see, four-index zone indices in square or angle brackets sometimes mix a single direct-lattice index on the right with reciprocal-lattice indices (normally in round or curly brackets) on the left.\n\nAnd, note that for hexagonal interplanar distances, they take the form\n:<math>\nd_{hk\\ell} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{\\tfrac{4}{3}\\left(h^2+k^2+hk \\right)+\\tfrac{a^2}{c^2}\\ell^2}}\n</math>\n\n==Crystallographic planes and directions==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}\n[[Image:Cristal densite surface.svg|thumb|Dense crystallographic planes]]\n\nCrystallographic directions are [[line (mathematics)|lines]] linking nodes ([[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s) of a crystal. Similarly, crystallographic [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] are ''planes'' linking nodes. Some directions and planes have a higher density of nodes; these dense planes have an influence on the behavior of the crystal:\n*[[optics|optical properties]]: in condensed matter, [[light]] \"jumps\" from one atom to the other with the [[Rayleigh scattering]]; the [[velocity of light]] thus varies according to the directions, whether the atoms are close or far; this gives the [[birefringence]]\n*[[adsorption]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]: adsorption and chemical reactions can occur at atoms or molecules on crystal surfaces, these phenomena are thus sensitive to the density of nodes;\n*[[surface tension]]: the condensation of a material means that the atoms, ions or molecules are more stable if they are surrounded by other similar species; the surface tension of an interface thus varies according to the density on the surface\n** Pores and [[crystallite]]s tend to have straight grain boundaries following dense planes\n**[[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]]\n*[[dislocation]]s ([[plastic deformation]])\n**the dislocation core tends to spread on dense planes (the elastic perturbation is \"diluted\"); this reduces the [[friction]] ([[Peierls\u2013Nabarro force]]), the sliding occurs more frequently on dense planes;\n**the perturbation carried by the dislocation ([[Burgers vector]]) is along a dense direction: the shift of one node in a dense direction is a lesser distortion;\n**the dislocation line tends to follow a dense direction, the dislocation line is often a straight line, a dislocation loop is often a [[polygon]].\nFor all these reasons, it is important to determine the planes and thus to have a notation system.\n\n==Integer vs. irrational Miller indices: Lattice planes and quasicrystals==\n\nOrdinarily, Miller indices are always integers by definition, and this constraint is physically significant.  To understand this, suppose that we allow a plane (abc) where the Miller \"indices\" ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (defined as above) are not necessarily integers.\n\nIf ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' have [[rational number|rational]] ratios, then the same family of planes can be written in terms of integer indices (hk\u2113) by scaling ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' appropriately: divide by the largest of the three numbers, and then multiply by the [[least common denominator]].  Thus, integer Miller indices implicitly include indices with all rational ratios.  The reason why planes where the components (in the reciprocal-lattice basis) have rational ratios are of special interest is that these are the [[lattice plane]]s: they are the only planes whose intersections with the crystal are 2d-periodic.\n\nFor a plane (abc) where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' have [[irrational number|irrational]] ratios, on the other hand, the intersection of the plane with the crystal is ''not'' periodic.  It forms an aperiodic pattern known as a [[quasicrystal]]. This construction corresponds precisely to the standard \"cut-and-project\" method of defining a quasicrystal, using a plane with irrational-ratio Miller indices. (Although many quasicrystals, such as the [[Penrose tiling]], are formed by \"cuts\" of periodic lattices in more than three dimensions, involving the intersection of more than one such [[hyperplane]].)\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Crystal structure]]\n*[[Crystal habit]]\n*[[Kikuchi line (solid state physics)|Kikuchi line]]\n*[[Zone axis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Miller index}}\n*[http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Miller_indices IUCr Online Dictionary of Crystallography]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060208140059/http://www.ece.byu.edu/cleanroom/EW_orientation.phtml Miller index description with diagrams]\n*[http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/miller_indices/index.php Online tutorial about lattice planes and Miller indices].\n*[https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ MTEX&nbsp;\u2013 Free MATLAB toolbox for Texture Analysis]\n*http://sourceforge.net/projects/orilib &nbsp;\u2013 A collection of routines for rotation / orientation manipulation, including special tools for crystal orientations.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller Index}}\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n[[Category:Crystallography]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Miller Indices Felix Kling.svg|thumb|300px|Planes with different Miller indices in cubic crystals]]\n[[Image:Indices miller direction exemples.png|thumb|300px|Examples of directions]]\n'''Miller indices''' form a notation system in [[crystallography]] for planes in [[Bravais lattice|crystal (Bravais) lattices]].\n\nIn particular, a family of [[lattice plane]]s is determined by three [[integer]]s ''h'', ''k'', and&nbsp;''\u2113'', the ''Miller indices''.

However they don't operate by similarly adding a redundant index to the regular three-index set.\n\nFor example, the reciprocal lattice vector (hk\u2113) as suggested above can be written in terms of reciprocal lattice vectors as <math>h\\mathbf{b_1} + k\\mathbf{b_2} + \\ell\\mathbf{b_3}</math>. For hexagonal crystals this may be expressed in terms of direct-lattice basis-vectors '''a<sub>1</sub>''', '''a<sub>2</sub>''' and '''a<sub>3</sub>''' as\n\n:<math>h\\mathbf{b_1} + k\\mathbf{b_2} + \\ell \\mathbf{b_3}= \\frac{2}{3 a^2}(2 h + k)\\mathbf{a_1} + \\frac{2}{3 a^2}(h+2k)\\mathbf{a_2} + \\frac{1}{c^2} (\\ell) \\mathbf{a_3}.</math>\n\nHence zone indices of the direction perpendicular to plane (hk\u2113) are, in suitably normalized triplet form, simply <math>[2h+k,h+2k,\\ell(3/2)(a/c)^2]</math>.  When ''four indices'' are used for the zone normal to plane (hk\u2113), however, the literature often uses <math>[h,k,-h-k,\\ell(3/2)(a/c)^2]</math> instead.<ref>J. W. Edington (1976) ''Practical electron microscopy in materials science'' (N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken, Eindhoven) {{ISBN|1-878907-35-2}}, Appendix 2</ref>  Thus as you can see, four-index zone indices in square or angle brackets sometimes mix a single direct-lattice index on the right with reciprocal-lattice indices (normally in round or curly brackets) on the left.\n\nAnd, note that for hexagonal interplanar distances, they take the form\n:<math>\nd_{hk\\ell} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{\\tfrac{4}{3}\\left(h^2+k^2+hk \\right)+\\tfrac{a^2}{c^2}\\ell^2}}\n</math>\n\n==Crystallographic planes and directions==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}\n[[Image:Cristal densite surface.svg|thumb|Dense crystallographic planes]]\n\nCrystallographic directions are [[line (mathematics)|lines]] linking nodes ([[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s) of a crystal. Similarly, crystallographic [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] are ''planes'' linking nodes. Some directions and planes have a higher density of nodes; these dense planes have an influence on the behavior of the crystal:\n*[[optics|optical properties]]: in condensed matter, [[light]] \"jumps\" from one atom to the other with the [[Rayleigh scattering]]; the [[velocity of light]] thus varies according to the directions, whether the atoms are close or far; this gives the [[birefringence]]\n*[[adsorption]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]: adsorption and chemical reactions can occur at atoms or molecules on crystal surfaces, these phenomena are thus sensitive to the density of nodes;\n*[[surface tension]]: the condensation of a material means that the atoms, ions or molecules are more stable if they are surrounded by other similar species; the surface tension of an interface thus varies according to the density on the surface\n** Pores and [[crystallite]]s tend to have straight grain boundaries following dense planes\n**[[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]]\n*[[dislocation]]s ([[plastic deformation]])\n**the dislocation core tends to spread on dense planes (the elastic perturbation is \"diluted\"); this reduces the [[friction]] ([[Peierls\u2013Nabarro force]]), the sliding occurs more frequently on dense planes;\n**the perturbation carried by the dislocation ([[Burgers vector]]) is along a dense direction: the shift of one node in a dense direction is a lesser distortion;\n**the dislocation line tends to follow a dense direction, the dislocation line is often a straight line, a dislocation loop is often a [[polygon]].\nFor all these reasons, it is important to determine the planes and thus to have a notation system.\n\n==Integer vs. irrational Miller indices: Lattice planes and quasicrystals==\n\nOrdinarily, Miller indices are always integers by definition, and this constraint is physically significant.  To understand this, suppose that we allow a plane (abc) where the Miller \"indices\" ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (defined as above) are not necessarily integers.\n\nIf ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' have [[rational number|rational]] ratios, then the same family of planes can be written in terms of integer indices (hk\u2113) by scaling ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' appropriately: divide by the largest of the three numbers, and then multiply by the [[least common denominator]].  Thus, integer Miller indices implicitly include indices with all rational ratios.  The reason why planes where the components (in the reciprocal-lattice basis) have rational ratios are of special interest is that these are the [[lattice plane]]s: they are the only planes whose intersections with the crystal are 2d-periodic.\n\nFor a plane (abc) where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' have [[irrational number|irrational]] ratios, on the other hand, the intersection of the plane with the crystal is ''not'' periodic.  It forms an aperiodic pattern known as a [[quasicrystal]]. This construction corresponds precisely to the standard \"cut-and-project\" method of defining a quasicrystal, using a plane with irrational-ratio Miller indices. (Although many quasicrystals, such as the [[Penrose tiling]], are formed by \"cuts\" of periodic lattices in more than three dimensions, involving the intersection of more than one such [[hyperplane]].)\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Crystal structure]]\n*[[Crystal habit]]\n*[[Kikuchi line (solid state physics)|Kikuchi line]]\n*[[Zone axis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Miller index}}\n*[http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Miller_indices IUCr Online Dictionary of Crystallography]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060208140059/http://www.ece.byu.edu/cleanroom/EW_orientation.phtml Miller index description with diagrams]\n*[http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/miller_indices/index.php Online tutorial about lattice planes and Miller indices].\n*[https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/ MTEX&nbsp;\u2013 Free MATLAB toolbox for Texture Analysis]\n*http://sourceforge.net/projects/orilib &nbsp;\u2013 A collection of routines for rotation / orientation manipulation, including special tools for crystal orientations.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller Index}}\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n[[Category:Crystallography]]\n", "name_user": "Andel", "label": "safe", "comment": "Indices miller plan definition.png -> svg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_index"}

A population of gypsy moths will exist for many years in low densities. When the population enters the release phase, it rapidly expands to the outbreak phase where the population size will rise several orders of magnitude and fall back within only a few generations.<ref name=elkinton>{{cite journal |last=Elkinton |first=J.

Some species, such as the [[white-footed mouse]] or ''[[Anastaus disparis]]'', have a significant impact on the gypsy moth [[population dynamics]]. On the other hand, avian predation and [[invertebrate]] [[predation]] show only small effects on the population dynamics of the gypsy moth.\n\n==== Small mammals ====\n\nThe [[white-footed mouse]], ''Peromyscus leucopus'', is considered important for regulating sparse gypsy moth populations.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} Rodents consume larvae and pupae that seek resting sites near or on the ground.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} The white-footed mouse is the most common and widely distributed small mammal in the US northeast.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|108}} The [[Northern short-tailed shrew]] is common east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and will consume the larva and pupa.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|108}}\n\n==== Birds ====\n\nInsectivorous birds prey upon the larva of the gypsy moth, but the egg clusters are protected by their hair coverings.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} The effects of bird predation have not been fully studied in North America,<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} but it has been well documented in Japan and Eurasia.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} When outbreaks of gypsy moths occur, bird predation has no significant effect on the population.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|105}} Birds that consume gypsy moth larvae, pupae and adults include the [[blue jay]], [[red-eyed vireo]], [[eastern towhee]], [[northern oriole]], [[catbird]] and the [[European robin|robin]].<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|105}} The [[black-capped chickadee]] feeds on the moth throughout its entire life cycle, including the eggs.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|105}}\n\nMany bird species feed on gypsy moth larvae, but they are not a major food source for any common bird species.

During periods when population numbers are dense, pupation is not restricted to these locations, but can take place in sheltered and open locations, even exposed on the trunks of trees or on foliage of nonhost trees.

Some species, such as the [[white-footed mouse]] or ''[[Anastaus disparis]]'', have a significant impact on the gypsy moth [[population dynamics]]. On the other hand, avian predation and [[invertebrate]] [[predation]] show only small effects on the population dynamics of the gypsy moth.\n\n==== Small mammals ====\n\nThe [[white-footed mouse]], ''Peromyscus leucopus'', is considered important for regulating sparse gypsy moth populations.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} Rodents consume larvae and pupae that seek resting sites near or on the ground.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} The white-footed mouse is the most common and widely distributed small mammal in the US northeast.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|108}} The [[Northern short-tailed shrew]] is common east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and will consume the larva and pupa.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|108}}\n\n==== Birds ====\n\nInsectivorous birds prey upon the larva of the gypsy moth, but the egg clusters are protected by their hair coverings.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} The effects of bird predation have not been fully studied in North America,<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} but it has been well documented in Japan and Eurasia.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|21}} When outbreaks of gypsy moths occur, bird predation has no significant effect on the population.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|105}} Birds that consume gypsy moth larvae, pupae and adults include the [[blue jay]], [[red-eyed vireo]], [[eastern towhee]], [[northern oriole]], [[catbird]] and the [[European robin|robin]].<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|105}} The [[black-capped chickadee]] feeds on the moth throughout its entire life cycle, including the eggs.<ref name=\"USDA\" />{{rp|105}}\n\nMany bird species feed on gypsy moth larvae, but they are not a major food source for any common bird species. Although a few European studies cite avian [[predation]] as a large influence in keeping the gypsy moth population in control, few studies exist to prove this.<ref name=elkinton />\n\n==== Invertebrate predation ====\n\n''[[Calosoma sycophanta]]'' is a beetle that preys upon the gypsy moth larvae and pupae.

For its first three months, the program aired only on weekday mornings; a Saturday morning edition was added in December 1955. During the 1964-65 season, the Saturday broadcast was temporarily replaced by ''Mr. Mayor'', a children's program that served as a vehicle for ''Captain Kangaroo'' star [[Bob Keeshan]]; after returning in the fall of 1965, the Saturday edition of ''Captain Kangaroo'' was discontinued again in 1968, relegating it to weekdays only. Except for pre-emptions due to [[breaking news]] coverage, notably the network's three-day-long continuous coverage of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, and a few episodes that ran for 45 minutes, the program aired as an hour-long broadcast on weekday mornings until 1981. On September 9, 1968, the program began broadcasting in [[color television|color]].\n\nIts audience of predominately children could never help the program compete in the ratings with entertainment/news shows such as [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', although ''Captain Kangaroo'' would become a three-time [[Emmy Award]] winner for \"Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series\" in 1979, 1983 and 1984. In the fall of 1981, as part of an expansion of the ''[[CBS Morning News]]'', ''Captain Kangaroo'' was moved to the earlier time slot of 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and reduced to half-hour \u2013 at which time, the program was retitled ''Wake Up with the Captain''.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, ''Captain'' was relegated to a Saturday morning 7:00&nbsp;a.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]) time slot. The network offered a package of reruns to CBS-affiliated stations to air on Sunday mornings in place of the previous block of animated series reruns. Most CBS affiliates only cleared the Saturday morning broadcast of program afterward. Still a third of CBS' affiliated stations had stopped airing ''Captain Kangaroo'' entirely after 1982. The program was finally canceled altogether in late 1984, citing a lack of affiliate clearances. Alongside ''Captain Kangaroo'', CBS aired various animated series aimed at kids during the 1960 and 1970s, such as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/10/50-greatest-saturday-morning-cartoons/the-new-adventures-of-mighty-mouse-and-heckle-jeck|title=The 50 Greatest Saturday Morning Cartoons44. <em>The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle</em> (CBS, 1979-1982)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}</ref>\n\n===The ''In the News'' era (1971\u20131986)===\nFrom 1971 to 1986, [[CBS News]] produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. The \"micro-series\" (as it would be labelled today) had its genesis in a series of animated interstitials produced by CBS and [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] called ''In the Know'', featuring the title characters from [[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]] narrating educational news segments tailored for children. This eventually evolved into a more live-action-oriented micro-series.\n\n===''CBS Kid TV'' (1986\u20131993)===\nIn 1989, the network began branding its Saturday morning block as ''CBS Kid TV'', and incorporated additional programs over the next few years such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures]]'', ''[[Back to the Future (TV series)|Back to the Future]]'' and ''[[Mother Goose and Grimm (TV series)|Mother Goose and Grimm]]''. ''CBS Kid TV'''s break bumpers featured the character [[Fido Dido]]. Four years prior to the block's rebrand, the network premiered its first in-house animated series since their original [[Terrytoons]], ''[[CBS Storybreak]]''; originally hosted by Bob Keeshan, the half-hour series \u2013 which featured animated adaptations of popular children's books \u2013 was nominated for an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Animated Program\" in 1986. ''Storybreak'' continued to air on the network in reruns until 1992, before returning in September 1993 with new hosted segments conducted by [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]].\n\nOne of the network's most popular children's programs around this time was ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'', an animated series which debuted in 1984 and ran for eight seasons. At the height of its popularity, CBS aired the program in two- or three-episode blocks. The program was briefly renamed ''Muppets, Babies and Monsters'' during the show's second season, with the second half-hour of the block filled by ''[[Little Muppet Monsters]]'', a new series which featured live-action puppets and cartoons starring the adult Muppet characters. The program lasted three weeks before its cancellation (leaving 15 already produced episodes unaired), replaced by an additional half-hour of ''Muppet Babies''. ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', which debuted in 1986, also became a major hit for the network's Saturday morning lineup; known for its bizarre humor, reruns of the series were abruptly dropped by CBS in 1991 \u2013 less than a year after the series ended its five-year run \u2013 following star [[Paul Reubens]]' arrest after allegedly [[indecent exposure|exposing himself]] in a [[Sarasota, Florida]] adult movie theatre.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pee-wee back with bizarre appeal intact|author=Jill Vejnoska|newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|page=1D|date=July 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAnother popular series was ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', based on the [[Garfield]] newspaper comics, which debuted on the network in 1988; the episodes featured a mix of longer-length animated segments and short segments known as \"Quickies\", featuring characters from the ''Garfield'' and ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' strips. Although the series had still been doing well in the ratings, ''Garfield and Friends'' ended in 1994 after seven seasons through a mutual agreement to cease production, after the show's production company nixed a proposal by CBS to reduce its production budget.\n\nOne series that never made it to the Saturday morning lineup was ''[[Garbage Pail Kids (TV series)|Garbage Pail Kids]]'', a series based on the [[trading card]] series of the same name by [[Topps Company]]. CBS heavily promoted the series in the run-up to the 1987-88 season, having ordered an entire season of episodes; however it was abruptly pulled a few days before its premiere (replaced with a third half-hour of ''Muppet Babies''), following protests from [[Action for Children's Television]], the National Coalition on Television Violence and the [[Christian Leaders for Responsible Television]] due to claims that the series ridiculed the handicapped, glorified violence, and served mainly as a [[infomercial|program-length commercial]] for the cards. Some advertisers (such as [[Nabisco]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Crayola]]) also pulled out of sponsoring the program, either due to pressure from special interest groups, or because a preview tape of the show was not available in time for review. A few CBS stations (such as [[WIBW-TV]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]]; [[KOTV-DT|KOTV]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and [[KREM-TV]] in [[Spokane, Washington]]) opted not to carry the program, notifying the network of their decision to pre-empt the program weeks in advance of the debut.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS gives in to pressure, dumps \"Garbage Pail Kids\"|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&dat=19870918&id=gw8TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ufoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4994,641862|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Spokane Chronicle]]|via=[[Google News]]|date=September 18, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why Were There No Cartoons??? |url=http://www.geocities.com/adambombcartoons/why.htm |work=Adam Bomb Cartoons |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kn9IOdsK?url=http://www.geocities.com/adambombcartoons/why.htm }}</ref>\n\nAnother series which also never made it to the CBS Saturday morning lineup was ''The Noids'', which was based on the ''[[Noid]]'' mascot featured in ''[[Domino's Pizza]]'' commercials and would have aired during the 1988-89 season. The show was scrapped due to complaints that it was nothing but an advertising ploy and not appropriate for children. {{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===''CBS Saturday''/''CBS Toontastic TV''/''CBS Saturday Morning''/''CBS Kidz'' (1993\u20131997)===\nIn September 1993, the block was rebranded as ''CBS Saturday''. The block was later rebranded as ''CBS Toontastic TV'' in 1994, ''CBS Saturday Morning'' in 1995, and ''CBS Kidz'' in 1996. Additional live-action and animated programs that aired on the block around this time included ''[[Beakman's World]]'', ''[[Beethoven (TV series)|Beethoven]]'', ''[[The Mask: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat]]'', and ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''.\n\nDuring the early and mid-1990s, through a partnership between the network and [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] provided much of CBS's animated programming (in addition, Disney partnered with CBS for some of its holiday specials such as ''[[Happy New Year, America]]'' and ''The All-American Thanksgiving Day Parade''). The partnership led to, among other shows, several adaptations of recent Disney films (such as ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid: The Series]]'', ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'' and ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin: The Series]]'') appearing on CBS's Saturday morning lineup. These series also aired concurrently on the syndicated animation block [[The Disney Afternoon]]. The partnership ended in 1996, following the completion of Disney's purchase of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and its corporate parent [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.]], around which time that all Disney-produced programs still airing on CBS at the time left the network.\n\n====''Action Zone'' (1994\u20131997)====\nIn an effort to compete with other action series at the time, ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' was revamped into a more action-oriented series with less comedy, and along with new shows ''[[WildC.A.T.s (TV series)|WildC.A.T.s]]'' and ''[[Skeleton Warriors]]'' was grouped into a new sub-block, \"Action Zone\", which premiered in September 1994; the sub-block featured a fly-through robotic style pre-opening that eventually segued into the show's opening title sequence. ''WildC.A.T.s.'' and ''Skeleton Warriors'' were cancelled around a year later, at which time the sub-block was discontinued although ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' individually retained the \"Action Zone\" brand until that series ended its run two years later.\n\n===''Think CBS Kids'' and deal with Nelvana/''CBS Kidshow'' (September 1997\u2013December 2012)===\n{{main|CBS Kidshow}}\nIn 1997, taking advantage of the tightened [[Children's Television Act]] regulations mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] that required broadcasters to carry three hours of educational programming each week, CBS launched an all-\"[[E/I|educational/informational]]\" Saturday morning lineup for the 1997-98 season, known as ''Think CBS Kids'', replacing CBS Kidz. The block \u2013 composed entirely of live-action series (marking the first time that CBS did not feature animated series within its children's program lineup) \u2013 included the youth-oriented game show ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' (a spin-off of the syndicated ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', which would ironically become a CBS-distributed property through the company's 2000 acquisition of [[King World]]), which aired simultaneously on the [[Game Show Network]]. Other programs included a magazine series based on ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids|Sports Illustrated for Kids]]'', the long-running ''Beakman's World'', the second season of ''[[Fudge (TV series)|Fudge]]'', and notably, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s first regular television show, ''[[The Weird Al Show]]''. ''In the News'' was also briefly revived as part of the ''Think CBS Kids'' block, hosted by CBS Radio News Washington correspondent Dan Raviv (in place of original narrators [[Christopher Glenn]] and Gary Shepard).\n\nAt this time, CBS reduced its Saturday morning children's program lineup to three hours, with the launch of the two hour-long ''CBS News Saturday Morning'' (which eventually evolved into the Saturday edition of ''[[The Early Show]]''). Since 1997, like other networks, the scheduling of CBS's children's programming has varied depending on the CBS station (for example, then-affiliate [[KTVT]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] \u2013 now [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] by CBS \u2013 aired the experimental ''Think CBS Kids'' block from 9:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. on Saturdays and 7:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. on Sundays from 1997 to 1998). ''Think CBS Kids'' as a whole suffered from low ratings, resulting in the network canceling most of the shows after four months and replacing ''[[Fudge (TV series)|Fudge]]'' with reruns of ''CBS Storybreak''.\n\nIn 1998, CBS began contracting other companies to provide programming material for the network's Saturday morning schedule. The first of these blocks was the ''[[CBS Kidshow]]'' (using the tagline, \"The CBS Kidshow: Get in the Act.\"), which debuted in October of that year and featured programming from the [[Canada|Canadian]] animation studio [[Nelvana]]<ref name=\"Nick Jr. on CBS\">{{cite news|title=CBS picks Nick mix|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117782661.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=June 15, 2000|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> (such as ''[[Anatole (TV series)|Anatole]]'', ''[[Mythic Warriors]]'', ''[[Birdz]]'', ''[[Rescue Heroes]]'' and ''[[Flying Rhino Junior High]]''), replacing Think CBS Kids.<ref>{{cite news|title=CTV pacts for 3 Nelvana series|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117489638.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=|author=Brendan Kelly|work=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=December 22, 1998|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> In January 1999, ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'' and ''[[Rupert (TV series)|Rupert]]'' swapped networks, with the former moving from the CBS lineup to [[Nickelodeon]]'s preschool block [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]], while the latter moved from Nick Jr. to CBS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick vet CBS-bound as nets alter kidvid skeds|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117489365|author=Joseph Adalian|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=December 14, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===''Nick Jr. on CBS''/''Nick on CBS'' (2000\u20132006)===\n{{main|Nickelodeon on CBS}}\nAfter CBS's programming agreement with Nelvana ended in 2000, the network subsequently entered into a deal with [[Nickelodeon]] (which became a sister property to CBS, as a result of one-time CBS subsidiary-turned-media conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]'s merger with the network) to air programming from the [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr. block]] under the banner ''Nick Jr. on CBS''.<ref name=\"Nick Jr. on CBS\"/> The block debuted on September 16, 2000, hosted by Face, the animated host/mascot originated on the flagship Nick Jr. block. The lineup was rebranded as simply ''Nick on CBS'' on September 14, 2002, as the block incorporated live-action and animated Nickelodeon series aimed at older children in addition to the Nick Jr. series. The older-skewing Nickelodeon series were removed from the block on September 11, 2004, refocusing the block back exclusively toward preschooler-oriented series; the block also began incorporating interstitial hosted segments featuring Piper O'Possum.\n\nAll of the programs that aired as part of the block met the FCC's educational programming requirements, despite some tenuousness to some of the claims of educational content in some programs. It was for this reason that the block did not include some of Nickelodeon's most popular programs (most notably ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''), even during the more open-formatted Nick on CBS era.\n\nOn December 31, 2005, Viacom was split into two separate companies under the shared control of [[National Amusements]] (owned by [[Sumner Redstone]]), with CBS and all related broadcasting, television production and distribution properties as well as some non-production entities becoming part of the standalone company [[CBS Corporation]], while Nickelodeon became part of a restructured [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]]. ''Nick Jr. on CBS/Nick on CBS'' ended on September 9, 2006.\n\n===''KOL Secret Slumber Party''/''KEWLopolis''/''Cookie Jar TV'' (2006\u20132013)===\n{{Main|Cookie Jar TV}}\nOn January 19, 2006, less than a month after the Viacom-CBS split was finalized, CBS announced that it would enter into a three-year programming partnership with [[DIC Entertainment]] (which included the distribution of select [[broadcast delay|tape delayed]] [[Formula One]] auto races) to produce a new children's program block featuring new and recent series from its program library.<ref name=\"Synergy\">{{cite news|title=Synergy not kid-friendly at Eye web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117936466.html?categoryid=1050&cs=1&query=|author=Elizabeth Guider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=January 19, 2006|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080620.php |title=Cookie Jar and Dic Entertainment to Merge, Creating independent global children's entertainment and education powerhouse |work=Cookie Jar Group |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531232059/http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080620.php |archivedate=May 31, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=COOKIE JAR ENTERTAINMENT EXPANDS BRAND PORTFOLIO, TALENT AND GLOBAL REACH WITH CLOSING OF DIC TRANSACTION |url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php |work=Cookie Jar Group |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531231944/http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php |archivedate=May 31, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Screen \u2013 Home<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=dic30706.htm|work=Worldscreen|date=March 7, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAfter the announcement of the CBS/DIC partnership, the latter originally announced the block was to be branded the ''Secret Saturday Morning Slumber Party'' (or ''Saturday Morning Secret Slumber Party''); the block was later renamed as the ''KOL Secret Slumber Party'' after DIC Entertainment, which produced all of the children's programming for the block, partnered with [[AOL]] to co-produce the block's first-run programs through its KOL subsidiary.

The block's de facto hosts (and in turn, from whom the ''Secret Slumber Party'' name was partly derived from) were the [[Slumber Party Girls]], a [[teen pop]] group signed with [[Geffen Records]] (composed of [[Cassie Scerbo]], Mallory Low, [[Karla Deras]], Carolina Carattini and Caroline Scott), who appeared during commercial break bumpers and interstitial segments seen before the start and the final segment of each program as well as serving as the musical performers for one of the series featured in the block, ''Dance Revolution''.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, KOL withdrew its sponsorship from the network's Saturday morning block. CBS and DIC subsequently announced a new partnership with [[American Greetings|American Greetings Corporation]] to relaunch the block on September 21 of that year as ''KEWLopolis'', which would be targeted at young female children and serve as a tie-in with the monthly [[teen magazine]] ''[[Kewl Magazine|KEWL]]'' (which was established in part by DiC in May 2007, and is no longer in publication).<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Blocks Out KEWLopolis|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/7271|work=Animation Magazine|date=August 23, 2007}}</ref> Complimenting CBS's 2007 lineup \u2013 which included ''KOL Secret Slumber Party'' holdovers ''Cake'' and ''Horseland'' \u2013 were newly added series ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', ''[[Strawberry Shortcake (2003 TV series)|Strawberry Shortcake]]'' and ''[[Sushi Pack]]''.

Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several prime time animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]], beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''Garfield'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own Saturday morning cartoon on the network, Garfield and Friends, in 1988). Two animated specials by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, the [[stop motion]] classic ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]],'' and the traditionally animated ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty The Snowman]]'' have been annual holiday staples on CBS respectively since 1972 (Rudolph) (eight years after the special originally debuted on NBC) and 1969 (Frosty) (when it debuted on CBS). {{As of|2015}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''Frosty'' are the only two pre-1990 animated specials that continue to air on CBS on an annual basis; the broadcast rights to the ''Peanuts'' specials are now held by ABC while ''How The Grinch Stole Christmas'' is broadcast by NBC and [[Turner Broadcasting System]] outlets; [[ABC Family]] owns the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials. In the 21st century, ''Rudolph'' and ''Frosty'' have been joined by a series of newer specials that air on a semi-regular basis, including such entries as ''[[Frosty Returns]]'', the ''[[Robbie the Reindeer]]'' shorts, ''[[The Flight Before Christmas (2008 film)|The Flight Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[The Story of Santa Claus]]''.\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1992, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in a colorful [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface. The word \"SPECIAL\", in all caps and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (believed to be edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence \u2013 presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]] (who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]] following his death in 1959) \u2013 also appeared immediately before other CBS specials of the period (such as the annual presentations of the [[Miss USA]] pageant and the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of United States network television schedules]] \u2013 includes articles on Saturday morning children's programming schedules among the major networks\n* [[Children's programming on the American Broadcasting Company]]\n* [[Children's programming on NBC]]\n* [[Children's programming on TBS and TNT|Children's programming on TBS/TNT]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gymmy.tripod.com/CCFF/1967.html ''The CBS Children's Film Festival'' 1967] (start page; listings through 1984) (fan site).

For its first three months, the program aired only on weekday mornings; a Saturday morning edition was added in December 1955. During the 1964-65 season, the Saturday broadcast was temporarily replaced by ''Mr. Mayor'', a children's program that served as a vehicle for ''Captain Kangaroo'' star [[Bob Keeshan]]; after returning in the fall of 1965, the Saturday edition of ''Captain Kangaroo'' was discontinued again in 1968, relegating it to weekdays only. Except for pre-emptions due to [[breaking news]] coverage, notably the network's three-day-long continuous coverage of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, and a few episodes that ran for 45 minutes, the program aired as an hour-long broadcast on weekday mornings until 1981. On September 9, 1968, the program began broadcasting in [[color television|color]].\n\nIts audience of predominately children could never help the program compete in the ratings with entertainment/news shows such as [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', although ''Captain Kangaroo'' would become a three-time [[Emmy Award]] winner for \"Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series\" in 1979, 1983 and 1984. In the fall of 1981, as part of an expansion of the ''[[CBS Morning News]]'', ''Captain Kangaroo'' was moved to the earlier time slot of 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and reduced to half-hour \u2013 at which time, the program was retitled ''Wake Up with the Captain''.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, ''Captain'' was relegated to a Saturday morning 7:00&nbsp;a.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]) time slot. The network offered a package of reruns to CBS-affiliated stations to air on Sunday mornings in place of the previous block of animated series reruns. Most CBS affiliates only cleared the Saturday morning broadcast of program afterward. Still a third of CBS' affiliated stations had stopped airing ''Captain Kangaroo'' entirely after 1982. The program was finally canceled altogether in late 1984, citing a lack of affiliate clearances. Alongside ''Captain Kangaroo'', CBS aired various animated series aimed at kids during the 1960 and 1970s, such as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/10/50-greatest-saturday-morning-cartoons/the-new-adventures-of-mighty-mouse-and-heckle-jeck|title=The 50 Greatest Saturday Morning Cartoons44. <em>The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle</em> (CBS, 1979-1982)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}</ref>\n\n===The ''In the News'' era (1971\u20131986)===\nFrom 1971 to 1986, [[CBS News]] produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. The \"micro-series\" (as it would be labelled today) had its genesis in a series of animated interstitials produced by CBS and [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] called ''In the Know'', featuring the title characters from [[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]] narrating educational news segments tailored for children. This eventually evolved into a more live-action-oriented micro-series.\n\n===''CBS Kid TV'' (1986\u20131993)===\nIn 1989, the network began branding its Saturday morning block as ''CBS Kid TV'', and incorporated additional programs over the next few years such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures]]'', ''[[Back to the Future (TV series)|Back to the Future]]'' and ''[[Mother Goose and Grimm (TV series)|Mother Goose and Grimm]]''. ''CBS Kid TV'''s break bumpers featured the character [[Fido Dido]]. Four years prior to the block's rebrand, the network premiered its first in-house animated series since their original [[Terrytoons]], ''[[CBS Storybreak]]''; originally hosted by Bob Keeshan, the half-hour series \u2013 which featured animated adaptations of popular children's books \u2013 was nominated for an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Animated Program\" in 1986. ''Storybreak'' continued to air on the network in reruns until 1992, before returning in September 1993 with new hosted segments conducted by [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]].\n\nOne of the network's most popular children's programs around this time was ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'', an animated series which debuted in 1984 and ran for eight seasons. At the height of its popularity, CBS aired the program in two- or three-episode blocks. The program was briefly renamed ''Muppets, Babies and Monsters'' during the show's second season, with the second half-hour of the block filled by ''[[Little Muppet Monsters]]'', a new series which featured live-action puppets and cartoons starring the adult Muppet characters. The program lasted three weeks before its cancellation (leaving 15 already produced episodes unaired), replaced by an additional half-hour of ''Muppet Babies''. ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', which debuted in 1986, also became a major hit for the network's Saturday morning lineup; known for its bizarre humor, reruns of the series were abruptly dropped by CBS in 1991 \u2013 less than a year after the series ended its five-year run \u2013 following star [[Paul Reubens]]' arrest after allegedly [[indecent exposure|exposing himself]] in a [[Sarasota, Florida]] adult movie theatre.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pee-wee back with bizarre appeal intact|author=Jill Vejnoska|newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|page=1D|date=July 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAnother popular series was ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', based on the [[Garfield]] newspaper comics, which debuted on the network in 1988; the episodes featured a mix of longer-length animated segments and short segments known as \"Quickies\", featuring characters from the ''Garfield'' and ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' strips. Although the series had still been doing well in the ratings, ''Garfield and Friends'' ended in 1994 after seven seasons through a mutual agreement to cease production, after the show's production company nixed a proposal by CBS to reduce its production budget.\n\nOne series that never made it to the Saturday morning lineup was ''[[Garbage Pail Kids (TV series)|Garbage Pail Kids]]'', a series based on the [[trading card]] series of the same name by [[Topps Company]]. CBS heavily promoted the series in the run-up to the 1987-88 season, having ordered an entire season of episodes; however it was abruptly pulled a few days before its premiere (replaced with a third half-hour of ''Muppet Babies''), following protests from [[Action for Children's Television]], the National Coalition on Television Violence and the [[Christian Leaders for Responsible Television]] due to claims that the series ridiculed the handicapped, glorified violence, and served mainly as a [[infomercial|program-length commercial]] for the cards. Some advertisers (such as [[Nabisco]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Crayola]]) also pulled out of sponsoring the program, either due to pressure from special interest groups, or because a preview tape of the show was not available in time for review. A few CBS stations (such as [[WIBW-TV]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]]; [[KOTV-DT|KOTV]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and [[KREM-TV]] in [[Spokane, Washington]]) opted not to carry the program, notifying the network of their decision to pre-empt the program weeks in advance of the debut.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS gives in to pressure, dumps \"Garbage Pail Kids\"|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&dat=19870918&id=gw8TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ufoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4994,641862|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Spokane Chronicle]]|via=[[Google News]]|date=September 18, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why Were There No Cartoons??? |url=http://www.geocities.com/adambombcartoons/why.htm |work=Adam Bomb Cartoons |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kn9IOdsK?url=http://www.geocities.com/adambombcartoons/why.htm }}</ref>\n\nAnother series which also never made it to the CBS Saturday morning lineup was ''The Noids'', which was based on the ''[[Noid]]'' mascot featured in ''[[Domino's Pizza]]'' commercials and would have aired during the 1988-89 season. The show was scrapped due to complaints that it was nothing but an advertising ploy and not appropriate for children. {{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n===''CBS Saturday''/''CBS Toontastic TV''/''CBS Saturday Morning''/''CBS Kidz'' (1993\u20131997)===\nIn September 1993, the block was rebranded as ''CBS Saturday''. The block was later rebranded as ''CBS Toontastic TV'' in 1994, ''CBS Saturday Morning'' in 1995, and ''CBS Kidz'' in 1996. Additional live-action and animated programs that aired on the block around this time included ''[[Beakman's World]]'', ''[[Beethoven (TV series)|Beethoven]]'', ''[[The Mask: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat]]'', and ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''.\n\nDuring the early and mid-1990s, through a partnership between the network and [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] provided much of CBS's animated programming (in addition, Disney partnered with CBS for some of its holiday specials such as ''[[Happy New Year, America]]'' and ''The All-American Thanksgiving Day Parade''). The partnership led to, among other shows, several adaptations of recent Disney films (such as ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid: The Series]]'', ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'' and ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin: The Series]]'') appearing on CBS's Saturday morning lineup. These series also aired concurrently on the syndicated animation block [[The Disney Afternoon]]. The partnership ended in 1996, following the completion of Disney's purchase of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and its corporate parent [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.]], around which time that all Disney-produced programs still airing on CBS at the time left the network.\n\n====''Action Zone'' (1994\u20131997)====\nIn an effort to compete with other action series at the time, ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' was revamped into a more action-oriented series with less comedy, and along with new shows ''[[WildC.A.T.s (TV series)|WildC.A.T.s]]'' and ''[[Skeleton Warriors]]'' was grouped into a new sub-block, \"Action Zone\", which premiered in September 1994; the sub-block featured a fly-though robotic style pre-opening that eventually segued into the show's opening title sequence. ''WildC.A.T.s.'' and ''Skeleton Warriors'' were cancelled around a year later, at which time the sub-block was discontinued although ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' individually retained the \"Action Zone\" brand until that series ended its run two years later.\n\n===''Think CBS Kids'' and deal with Nelvana/''CBS Kidshow'' (September 1997\u2013December 2012)===\n{{main|CBS Kidshow}}\nIn 1997, taking advantage of the tightened [[Children's Television Act]] regulations mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] that required broadcasters to carry three hours of educational programming each week, CBS launched an all-\"[[E/I|educational/informational]]\" Saturday morning lineup for the 1997-98 season, known as ''Think CBS Kids'', replacing CBS Kidz. The block \u2013 composed entirely of live-action series (marking the first time that CBS did not feature animated series within its children's program lineup) \u2013 included the youth-oriented game show ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' (a spin-off of the syndicated ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', which would ironically become a CBS-distributed property through the company's 2000 acquisition of [[King World]]), which aired simultaneously on the [[Game Show Network]]. Other programs included a magazine series based on ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids|Sports Illustrated for Kids]]'', the long-running ''Beakman's World'', the second season of ''[[Fudge (TV series)|Fudge]]'', and notably, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s first regular television show, ''[[The Weird Al Show]]''. ''In the News'' was also briefly revived as part of the ''Think CBS Kids'' block, hosted by CBS Radio News Washington correspondent Dan Raviv (in place of original narrators [[Christopher Glenn]] and Gary Shepard).\n\nAt this time, CBS reduced its Saturday morning children's program lineup to three hours, with the launch of the two hour-long ''CBS News Saturday Morning'' (which eventually evolved into the Saturday edition of ''[[The Early Show]]''). Since 1997, like other networks, the scheduling of CBS's children's programming has varied depending on the CBS station (for example, then-affiliate [[KTVT]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] \u2013 now [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] by CBS \u2013 aired the experimental ''Think CBS Kids'' block from 9:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. on Saturdays and 7:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. on Sundays from 1997 to 1998). ''Think CBS Kids'' as a whole suffered from low ratings, resulting in the network canceling most of the shows after four months and replacing ''[[Fudge (TV series)|Fudge]]'' with reruns of ''CBS Storybreak''.\n\nIn 1998, CBS began contracting other companies to provide programming material for the network's Saturday morning schedule. The first of these blocks was the ''[[CBS Kidshow]]'' (using the tagline, \"The CBS Kidshow: Get in the Act.\"), which debuted in October of that year and featured programming from the [[Canada|Canadian]] animation studio [[Nelvana]]<ref name=\"Nick Jr. on CBS\">{{cite news|title=CBS picks Nick mix|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117782661.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=June 15, 2000|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> (such as ''[[Anatole (TV series)|Anatole]]'', ''[[Mythic Warriors]]'', ''[[Birdz]]'', ''[[Rescue Heroes]]'' and ''[[Flying Rhino Junior High]]''), replacing Think CBS Kids.<ref>{{cite news|title=CTV pacts for 3 Nelvana series|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117489638.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&query=|author=Brendan Kelly|work=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=December 22, 1998|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> In January 1999, ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'' and ''[[Rupert (TV series)|Rupert]]'' swapped networks, with the former moving from the CBS lineup to [[Nickelodeon]]'s preschool block [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]], while the latter moved from Nick Jr. to CBS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick vet CBS-bound as nets alter kidvid skeds|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117489365|author=Joseph Adalian|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=December 14, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===''Nick Jr. on CBS''/''Nick on CBS'' (2000\u20132006)===\n{{main|Nickelodeon on CBS}}\nAfter CBS's programming agreement with Nelvana ended in 2000, the network subsequently entered into a deal with [[Nickelodeon]] (which became a sister property to CBS, as a result of one-time CBS subsidiary-turned-media conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]'s merger with the network) to air programming from the [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr. block]] under the banner ''Nick Jr. on CBS''.<ref name=\"Nick Jr. on CBS\"/> The block debuted on September 16, 2000, hosted by Face, the animated host/mascot originated on the flagship Nick Jr. block. The lineup was rebranded as simply ''Nick on CBS'' on September 14, 2002, as the block incorporated live-action and animated Nickelodeon series aimed at older children in addition to the Nick Jr. series. The older-skewing Nickelodeon series were removed from the block on September 11, 2004, refocusing the block back exclusively toward preschooler-oriented series; the block also began incorporating interstitial hosted segments featuring Piper O'Possum.\n\nAll of the programs that aired as part of the block met the FCC's educational programming requirements, despite some tenuousness to some of the claims of educational content in some programs. It was for this reason that the block did not include some of Nickelodeon's most popular programs (most notably ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''), even during the more open-formatted Nick on CBS era.\n\nOn December 31, 2005, Viacom was split into two separate companies under the shared control of [[National Amusements]] (owned by [[Sumner Redstone]]), with CBS and all related broadcasting, television production and distribution properties as well as some non-production entities becoming part of the standalone company [[CBS Corporation]], while Nickelodeon became part of a restructured [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]].

The block's de facto hosts (and in turn, from whom the ''Secret Slumber Party'' name was partly derived from) were the [[Slumber Party Girls]], a [[teen pop]] group signed with [[Geffen Records]] (composed of [[Cassie Scerbo]], Mallory Low, [[Karla Deras]], Carolina Carattini and Caroline Scott), who appeared during commercial break bumpers and interstitial segments seen before the start and the final segment of each program as well as serving as the musical performers for one of the series featured in the block, ''Dance Revolution''.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, KOL withdrew its sponsorship from the network's Saturday morning block. CBS and DIC subsequently announced a new partnership with [[American Greetings|American Greetings Corporation]] to relaunch the block on September 21 of that year as ''KEWLopolis'', which would be targeted at young female children and serve as a tie-in with the monthly [[teen magazine]] ''[[Kewl Magazine|KEWL]]'' (which was established in part by DiC in May 2007, and is no longer in publication).<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Blocks Out KEWLopolis|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/7271|work=Animation Magazine|date=August 23, 2007}}</ref> Complimenting CBS's 2007 lineup \u2013 which included ''KOL Secret Slumber Party'' holdovers ''Cake'' and ''Horseland'' \u2013 were newly added series ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', ''[[Strawberry Shortcake (2003 TV series)|Strawberry Shortcake]]'' and ''[[Sushi Pack]]''.

Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several prime time animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]], beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''Garfield'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own Saturday morning cartoon on the network, Garfield and Friends, in 1988). Two animated specials by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, the [[stop motion]] classic ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]],'' and the traditionally animated ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty The Snowman]]'' have been annual holiday staples on CBS respectively since 1972 (Rudolph) (eight years after the special originally debuted on NBC) and 1969 (Frosty) (when it debuted on CBS). {{As of|2015}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''Frosty'' are the only two pre-1990 animated specials that continue to air on CBS on an annual basis; the broadcast rights to the ''Peanuts'' specials are now held by ABC while ''How The Grinch Stole Christmas'' is broadcast by NBC and [[Turner Broadcasting System]] outlets; [[ABC Family]] owns the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials. In the 21st century, ''Rudolph'' and ''Frosty'' have been joined by a series of newer specials that air on a semi-regular basis, including such entries as ''[[Frosty Returns]]'', the ''[[Robbie the Reindeer]]'' shorts, ''[[The Flight Before Christmas (2008 film)|The Flight Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[The Story of Santa Claus]]''.\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1992, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in a colorful [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface. The word \"SPECIAL\", in all caps and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (believed to be edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence \u2013 presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]] (who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]] following his death in 1959) \u2013 also appeared immediately before other CBS specials of the period (such as the annual presentations of the [[Miss USA]] pageant and the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of United States network television schedules]] \u2013 includes articles on Saturday morning children's programming schedules among the major networks\n* [[Children's programming on the American Broadcasting Company]]\n* [[Children's programming on NBC]]\n* [[Children's programming on TBS and TNT|Children's programming on TBS/TNT]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://gymmy.tripod.com/CCFF/1967.html ''The CBS Children's Film Festival'' 1967] (start page; listings through 1984) (fan site).

The constitution of [[Namibia]] defines the role of the military as ''\"defending the territory and national interests.\"''\n\nNamibia's military was born from the integration of the formerly belligerent [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN), military wing of the [[South West African People's Organization]], and the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) \u2013 a security arm of the former South African administration.

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

It differs from the [[Light commercial vehicle]] \"[[GAZelle]]\" in that it does require a [[Driving licence in Russia|category C]] [[driver's license]]. The production of the truck ended in December 2015.<ref>[http://wroom.ru/en/cars/gaz/valdai GAZ Valdai]</ref>\n\n== Manufacturing History ==\n[[File:GAZ-33104B.jpg|thumb|left|GAZ-33104V]]\nAfter the economic collapse in the late 1990s, the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] Automobile Plant cartel (along with [[ZiL|AMO]]), created a flat-bed trailer to transport [[Truck classification#Medium duty|medium duty]] trucks in response to market demand. The first models were created in conjunction with [[Minsk Automobile Plant|MAZ]]. [[Minsk]] residents later refused to supply their GAZ type MAZ-5336, and instead launched a family of five-ton, low loader trucks; the MAZ-4370 \"Zubrenic\". GAZ had to develop their own cabin, because available cabins did not suit their needs. Eventually these cabins were used as the basis for the popular \"GAZelle\" (GAZ-3302). GAZ has produced two engine types: a compact, 4-cylinder engine and an inline six-cylinder diesel GAZ-562 (License Steyr).\n\nDespite its protruding engine cover, the modified engine compartment provided room for a second passenger within the cabin and is listed as \"conditional triple\" for short and long distances. The GAZ-3310 used modern teardrop-shaped headlights as well as a hood, grill and an integrated bumper, each of which have been modified. The prototype four-ton GAZ-3310, titled \"Valdai\", debuted at the Moscow International Automobile Salon in 1999. In 2003, \"Valdai\" began the mass production of block headlights which assisted in the restyling of their commercial \"Gazelle\" and \"Sable\" vehicles. The \"Valdai\" type chassis - a 5-ton diesel truck (GAZ-4301) - was modified with reversed front suspension; it introduced new front and rear axles, and low-profile tires. The braking system was originally only air, but was refined to allow the installation of an automatic braking system (ABS). The entire set of design modifications allowed for the creation of a modern truck with a low-loading height (1000&nbsp;mm), comfortable suspension, an advanced braking system, and an economical diesel engine.\n\nThe \"Valdai\" was offered with a choice of multiple engines: a diesel MMZ D-245.7, a gas (Steyr)-562, a Cummins 3.9 140 CIV, and an IVECO-8143, SOFIM. For economic reasons, preference was given to the Minsk D-245.7 modification (GAZ-33104). In 2006, production began on a 4-meter wheelbase version of the GAZ-331041. At the Moscow International Motor Show, an experimental version (GAZ-43483) was shown containing a reinforced chassis (GVW 8.5 tons and double) and a cabin designed for long-distance transport, together with a chassis for prospective models of small buses. In 2004\u20132006, the \"Valdai\" was created by experienced Russian makers of small buses ([[KAvZ|KAvZ - 32081]] and [[Pavlovo Bus Factory|PAZ-3202]]). Ukraine serially produced the small bus Galaz-3207, cars and the fire vehicle \"Killer Whale\".\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.titalcompany.com/ |title=Fire trucks |publisher=TITAL |accessdate=2010-01-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65oFf7XxU?url=http://www.titalcompany.com/ |archivedate=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>  In November 2010, GAZ announced the launch of 4-ton version GAZ-33106 with a Cummins ISF 3.8 engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazgroup.ru/news/news/?id=3356/|title=GAZ Group launched a car \"Valdai\" with diesel Cummins ISF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619WVYGJY?url=http://www.gazgroup.ru/news/news/?id=3356%2F|archivedate=2011-08-23|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn late December 2015 with the last truck \"Valdai\" was produced.<ref>http://wroom.ru/news/4505 (Russian)</ref> It was replaced by a new city 5-ton delivery truck GaZon NEXT City with low-profile wheels and low loading height, the production of which was launched in mid-2015.\n\n== Versions ==\n[[File:GAZ-331043.JPG|thumb|right|Showpiece GAZ Valdai double cabin (different chrome finish)]]\n[[File:Integrated Safety and Security Exhibition 2012 (452-9).jpg|thumb|[[EMERCOM]] GAZ Valdai three door extended cab]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It differs from the [[Light commercial vehicle]] \"[[GAZelle]]\" in that it does require a [[Driving licence in Russia|category C]] [[driver's license]]. The production of the truck ended in December 2015.<ref>[http://wroom.ru/en/cars/gaz/valdai GAZ Valdai]</ref>\n\n== Manufacturing History ==\n[[File:GAZ-33104B.jpg|thumb|left|GAZ-33104V]]\nAfter the economic collapse in the late 1990s, the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] Automobile Plant cartel (along with [[ZiL|AMO]]), created a flat-bed trailer to transport [[Truck classification#Medium duty|medium duty]] trucks in response to market demand. The first models were created in conjunction with [[Minsk Automobile Plant|MAZ]]. [[Minsk]] residents later refused to supply their GAZ type MAZ-5336, and instead launched a family of five-ton, low loader trucks; the MAZ-4370 \"Zubrenic\". GAZ had to develop their own cabin, because available cabins did not suit their needs. Eventually these cabins were used as the basis for the popular \"GAZelle\" (GAZ-3302). GAZ has produced two engine types: a compact, 4-cylinder engine and an inline six-cylinder diesel GAZ-562 (License Steyr).\n\nDespite its protruding engine cover, the modified engine compartment provided room for a second passenger within the cabin and is listed as \"conditional triple\" for short and long distances. The GAZ-3310 used modern teardrop-shaped headlights as well as a hood, grill and an integrated bumper, each of which have been modified. The prototype four-ton GAZ-3310, titled \"Valdai\", debuted at the Moscow International Automobile Salon in 1999. In 2003, \"Valdai\" began the mass production of block headlights which assisted in the restyling of their commercial \"Gazelle\" and \"Sable\" vehicles. The \"Valdai\" type chassis - a 5-ton diesel truck (GAZ-4301) - was modified with reversed front suspension; it introduced new front and rear axles, and low-profile tires. The braking system was originally only air, but was refined to allow the installation of an automatic braking system (ABS). The entire set of design modifications allowed for the creation of a modern truck with a low-loading height (1000&nbsp;mm), comfortable suspension, an advanced braking system, and an economical diesel engine.\n\nThe \"Valdai\" was offered with a choice of multiple engines: a diesel MMZ D-245.7, a gas (Steyr)-562, a Cummins 3.9 140 CIV, and an IVECO-8143, SOFIM. For economic reasons, preference was given to the Minsk D-245.7 modification (GAZ-33104). In 2006, production began on a 4-meter wheelbase version of the GAZ-331041. At the Moscow International Motor Show, an experimental version (GAZ-43483) was shown containing a reinforced chassis (GVW 8.5 tons and double) and a cabin designed for long-distance transport, together with a chassis for prospective models of small buses. In 2004-2006, the \"Valdai\" was created by experienced Russian makers of small buses ([[KAvZ|KAvZ - 32081]] and [[Pavlovo Bus Factory|PAZ-3202]]). Ukraine serially produced the small bus Galaz-3207, cars and the fire vehicle \"Killer Whale\".\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.titalcompany.com/ |title=Fire trucks |publisher=TITAL |accessdate=2010-01-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65oFf7XxU?url=http://www.titalcompany.com/ |archivedate=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>  In November 2010, GAZ announced the launch of 4-ton version GAZ-33106 with a Cummins ISF 3.8 engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazgroup.ru/news/news/?id=3356/|title=GAZ Group launched a car \"Valdai\" with diesel Cummins ISF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619WVYGJY?url=http://www.gazgroup.ru/news/news/?id=3356%2F|archivedate=2011-08-23|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn late December 2015 with the last truck \"Valdai\" was produced.<ref>http://wroom.ru/news/4505 (Russian)</ref> It was replaced by a new city 5-ton delivery truck GaZon NEXT City with low-profile wheels and low loading height, the production of which was launched in mid-2015.\n\n== Versions ==\n[[File:GAZ-331043.JPG|thumb|right|Showpiece GAZ Valdai double cabin (different chrome finish)]]\n[[File:Integrated Safety and Security Exhibition 2012 (452-9).jpg|thumb|[[EMERCOM]] GAZ Valdai three door extended cab]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
