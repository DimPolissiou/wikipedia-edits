I hope you enjoy the read!\n\n\n{{Redirect|Nematocyst|the subcellular structure in dinoflagellates|nematocyst (dinoflagellate)|the floating structure formed by algae|pneumatocyst}}\n[[File:Nematocyst1.jpg|thumb|Nomarski [[micrograph]] of a [[ruthenium red]]-stained nematocyst from ''[[Aiptasia]] pallida'', the pale anemone. The red dye stains the polyanionic venom proteins found inside the capsule of this partially-discharged nematocyst.]]\nA '''cnidocyte''' (also known as a '''cnidoblast''' or '''nematocyte''') is an explosive cell containing one giant secretory [[organelle]] or ''cnida'' (plural ''cnidae'') that defines the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]] ([[coral]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]]e, [[jellyfish]], etc.). Cnidae are used for prey capture and defense from predators. Despite being morphologically simple, lacking a skeleton and many species being [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], cnidarians prey on [[fish]] and [[crustacean]]s. A cnidocyte fires a structure that contains the [[toxin]], from a characteristic subcellular [[organelle]] called a '''cnidocyst''' (also known as a '''cnida''' or '''nematocyst''').  This is responsible for the stings delivered by a cnidarian.\n\n== Structure and function ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Nematocyst-discharged.png|thumb|right|A discharged nematocyst seen under a [[scanning electron microscope]]]] -->\n\nEach cnidocyte contains an organelle called a cnida, cnidocyst, nematocyst, ptychocyst or spirocyst. This organelle consists of a bulb-shaped capsule containing a coiled hollow tubule structure attached to it. An immature cnidocyte is referred to as a cnidoblast or nematoblast.

This causes a large concentration gradient of calcium across the cnidocyte plasma membrane. The resulting [[osmotic pressure]] causes a rapid influx of water into the cell. This increase in water volume in the cytoplasm forces the coiled cnidae tubule to eject rapidly. Prior to discharge the coiled cnidae tubule exists inside the cell in an \"inside out\" condition. The back pressure resulting from the influx of water into the cnidocyte together with the opening of the capsule tip structure or operculum, triggers the forceful eversion of the cnidae tubule causing it to right itself as it comes rushing out of the cell with enough force to impale a prey organism.\n\n=== Prey detection ===\n\nCnidae are \"single use\" cells, and this costs a lot of energy. In Hydrozoans, in order to regulate discharge, cnidocytes are connected as \"batteries\", containing several types of cnidocytes connected to supporting cells and neurons. The supporting cells contain [[Chemoreceptor|chemosensor]]s, which, together with the [[mechanoreceptor]] on the cnidocyte (cnidocil), allow only the right combination of stimuli to cause discharge, such as prey swimming, and chemicals found in prey [[cuticle]] or cuteous tissue. This prevents the cnidarian from stinging itself although sloughed off cnidae can be induced to fire independently.\n\n== Types of cnidae ==\nOver 30 types of cnidae are found in different cnidarians. They can be divided into the following groups:\n# Penetrant: The penetrant or stenotele is the largest and most complex nematocyst. When discharged, it pierces the skin or chitinous exoskeleton of the prey and injects the venomous fluid, hypnotoxin, that either paralyzes the victim or kills it.\n# Glutinant: a sticky surface used to stick to prey, referred to as ptychocysts and found on burrowing (tube) anemones, which help create the tube in which the animal lives\n# Volvent: The volvent or desmoneme is a small and pear-shaped nematocyst. It contains a short, thick, spineless, smooth and elastic thread tube forming a single loop and closed at the far end. When discharged, it tightly coils around the prey. They are the smallest nematocysts. A lasso-like string is fired at prey and wraps around a cellular projection on the prey, which are referred to as spirocysts.\n\nCnidocyte subtypes can be differentially localized in the animal. In the sea anemone ''Nematostella vectensis'', the majority of its non-penetrant sticky cnidocytes, the spirocytes, are found in the tentacles, and are thought to help with prey capture by sticking to the prey. By contrast, the two penetrant types of cnidocytes present in this species display a much broader localization, on the outer epithelial layer of the tentacles and body column, as well as on the pharynx epithelium and within mesenteries.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Zenkert|first=Claudia|last2=Takahashi|first2=Toshio|last3=Diesner|first3=Mark-Oliver|last4=\u00d6zbek|first4=Suat|date=2011-07-28|title=Morphological and Molecular Analysis of the Nematostella vectensis Cnidom|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e22725|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022725|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3145756|pmid=21829492|bibcode=2011PLoSO...622725Z}}</ref>\n\nThe diversity of cnidocytes types correlates with the expansion and diversification of structural cnidocyst genes like minicollagen genes.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Khalturin|first=Konstantin|last2=Shinzato|first2=Chuya|last3=Khalturina|first3=Maria|last4=Hamada|first4=Mayuko|last5=Fujie|first5=Manabu|last6=Koyanagi|first6=Ryo|last7=Kanda|first7=Miyuki|last8=Goto|first8=Hiroki|last9=Anton-Erxleben|first9=Friederike|last10=Toyokawa|first10=Masaya|last11=Toshino|first11=Sho|date=May 2019|title=Medusozoan genomes inform the evolution of the jellyfish body plan|journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution|volume=3|issue=5|pages=811\u2013822|doi=10.1038/s41559-019-0853-y|issn=2397-334X|pmid=30988488|doi-access=free}}</ref> Minicollagen genes form compact gene clusters in Cnidarian genomes, suggesting a diversification through gene duplication and subfunctionalization.

This causes a large concentration gradient of calcium across the cnidocyte plasma membrane. The resulting [[osmotic pressure]] causes a rapid influx of water into the cell. This increase in water volume in the cytoplasm forces the coiled cnidae tubule to eject rapidly. Prior to discharge the coiled cnidae tubule exists inside the cell in an \"inside out\" condition. The back pressure resulting from the influx of water into the cnidocyte together with the opening of the capsule tip structure or operculum, triggers the forceful eversion of the cnidae tubule causing it to right itself as it comes rushing out of the cell with enough force to impale a prey organism.\n\n=== Prey detection ===\n\nCnidae are \"single use\" cells, and this costs a lot of energy. In Hydrozoans, in order to regulate discharge, cnidocytes are connected as \"batteries\", containing several types of cnidocytes connected to supporting cells and neurons. The supporting cells contain [[Chemoreceptor|chemosensor]]s, which, together with the [[mechanoreceptor]] on the cnidocyte (cnidocil), allow only the right combination of stimuli to cause discharge, such as prey swimming, and chemicals found in prey [[cuticle]] or cuteous tissue. This prevents the cnidarian from stinging itself although sloughed off cnidae can be induced to fire independently.\n\n== Types of cnidae ==\nOver 30 types of cnidae are found in different cnidarians. They can be divided into the following groups:\n# Penetrant: The penetrant or stenotele is the largest and most complex nematocyst. When discharged, it pierces the skin or chitinous exoskeleton of the prey and injects the venomous fluid, hypnotoxin, that either paralyzes the victim or kills it.\n# Glutinant: a sticky surface used to stick to prey, referred to as ptychocysts and found on burrowing (tube) anemones, which help create the tube in which the animal lives\n# Volvent: The volvent or desmoneme is a small and pear-shaped nematocyst. It contains a short, thick, spineless, smooth and elastic thread tube forming a single loop and closed at the far end. When discharged, it tightly coils around the prey. They are the smallest nematocysts. A lasso-like string is fired at prey and wraps around a cellular projection on the prey, which are referred to as spirocysts.\n\nCnidocyte subtypes can be differentially localized in the animal. In the sea anemone ''Nematostella vectensis'', the majority of its non-penetrant sticky cnidocytes, the spirocytes, are found in the tentacles, and are thought to help with prey capture by sticking to the prey. By contrast, the two penetrant types of cnidocytes present in this species display a much broader localization, on the outer epithelial layer of the tentacles and body column, as well as on the pharynx epithelium and within mesenteries.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Zenkert|first=Claudia|last2=Takahashi|first2=Toshio|last3=Diesner|first3=Mark-Oliver|last4=\u00d6zbek|first4=Suat|date=2011-07-28|title=Morphological and Molecular Analysis of the Nematostella vectensis Cnidom|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e22725|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022725|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3145756|pmid=21829492|bibcode=2011PLoSO...622725Z}}</ref>\n\nThe diversity of cnidocytes types correlates with the expansion and diversification of structural cnidocyst genes like minicollagen genes.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Khalturin|first=Konstantin|last2=Shinzato|first2=Chuya|last3=Khalturina|first3=Maria|last4=Hamada|first4=Mayuko|last5=Fujie|first5=Manabu|last6=Koyanagi|first6=Ryo|last7=Kanda|first7=Miyuki|last8=Goto|first8=Hiroki|last9=Anton-Erxleben|first9=Friederike|last10=Toyokawa|first10=Masaya|last11=Toshino|first11=Sho|date=May 2019|title=Medusozoan genomes inform the evolution of the jellyfish body plan|journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution|volume=3|issue=5|pages=811\u2013822|doi=10.1038/s41559-019-0853-y|issn=2397-334X|pmid=30988488|doi-access=free}}</ref> Minicollagen genes form compact gene clusters in Cnidarian genomes, suggesting a diversification through gene duplication and subfunctionalization.

Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus first fuse onto a primary vesicle: the capsule primordium. Subsequent vesicle fusion enables the formation of a tubule outside of the capsule, which then invaginates into the capsule. Then, an early maturation phase enables the formation of long arrays of barbed spines onto the invaginated tubule through the condensation of spinalin proteins. Finally, a late maturation stage gives rise to undischarged capsules under high osmotic pressure through the synthesis of poly-\u03b3-glutamate into the matrix of the capsule. This trapped osmotic pressure enables rapid thread discharge upon triggering through a massive osmotic shock.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Charles N.|last2=\u00d6zbek|first2=Suat|last3=Adamczyk|first3=Patrizia|last4=Meier|first4=Sebastian|last5=Pauly|first5=Barbara|last6=Chapman|first6=Jarrod|last7=Hwang|first7=Jung Shan|last8=Gojobori|first8=Takashi|last9=Holstein|first9=Thomas W.|date=2008-09-01|title=Evolution of complex structures: minicollagens shape the cnidarian nematocyst|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=24|issue=9|pages=431\u2013438|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2008.07.001|pmid=18676050|issn=0168-9525}}</ref>\n\n== Nematocyst toxicity ==\n[[File:Chironex fleckeri nematocysts 01.jpg|thumb|Nematocysts from ''[[Chironex fleckeri]]'' (400x magnification)]]\nNematocysts are very efficient weapons.
