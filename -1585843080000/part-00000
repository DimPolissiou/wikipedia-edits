In 1940, Benton led the American League with 17 saves.  In 1941 he went 15\u20136 with a 2.97 [[earned run average]] (ERA) (second in the [[American League]] (AL)) in 38 games. He completed seven of 14 starts and got seven saves. Despite his 7\u201313 mark a year later, his ERA was 2.90 with career-highs in starts (30) and [[innings pitched]] (226{{frac|2|3}}). Benton was chosen for the AL All-Star team in both 1941 and 1942, and then missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons while serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n\nBenton was discharged from the Navy in November 1944 and had his best year in 1945. He compiled a record of 13\u20138, a career-low 2.02 ERA, five [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]]s, and 12 [[complete game]]s in 191{{frac|2|3}} innings. In a remarkable testament to the Tigers pitching in 1945, [[Hal Newhouser]] and Benton were No. 1 and No. 2 in ERA among AL pitchers.  Newhouser's [[Adjusted ERA+]] in 1945 was 195 and Benton's was 175. The Adjusted ERA+ figures posted by Newhouser and Benton in 1945 rank as the first and fifth best seasons all time for a [[Detroit Tigers]] pitcher with at least 150 innings pitched. Benton pitched in relief in three games in the [[1945 World Series]] and gave up only one earned run for a 1.93 World Series ERA.\n\nThe rest of his career he worked largely as a [[setup man]] or as an emergency starter. A two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] (1941\u201342), Benton compiled a career 98\u201388 record with 697 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.36 ERA in 1688{{frac|1|3}} innings. He died in 1968 at the age of 57 from burns he suffered when the [[Lynwood, California]], motel he managed exploded into flame.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Detroit Tigers team records#Best pitching seasons by a Tiger with sortable statistics|Best pitching seasons by a Detroit Tiger]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball all-time saves leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Baseballstats |br=b/bentoal01 |fangraphs=1000853|brm=benton001joh}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213659/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Al_Benton_1911&page=chronology Baseball Library]\n* {{Find a Grave|7942259}}\n\n{{1945 Detroit Tigers}}\n{{Detroit Tigers Opening Day starting pitchers}}\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Baseball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benton, Al}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1968 deaths]]\n[[Category:Accidental deaths in California]]\n[[Category:Albany Senators players]]\n[[Category:American League All-Stars]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Boston Red Sox players]]\n[[Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Indians players]]\n[[Category:Detroit Tigers players]]\n[[Category:Lincoln Links players]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitchers]]\n[[Category:Memphis Chickasaws players]]\n[[Category:Oklahoma City Indians players]]\n[[Category:People from Cleveland County, Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia Athletics players]]\n[[Category:Sacramento Solons players]]\n[[Category:San Diego Padres (minor league) players]]\n[[Category:Toledo Mud Hens players]]\n[[Category:Williamsport Grays players]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American baseball player}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n{{Infobox baseball biography\n| name        = Al Benton\n| position    = [[Pitcher]]\n| image       = \n| bats        = Right\n| throws      = Right\n| birth_date  = March 18, 1911\n| birth_place = [[Noble, Oklahoma]]\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|1968|4|14|1911|3|18}}\n| death_place = [[Lynwood, California]]\n|debutleague = MLB\n| debutdate   = April 18 \n| debutyear   = 1934\n| debutteam   = Philadelphia Athletics\n|finalleague = MLB\n| finaldate   = September 21\n| finalyear   = 1952\n| finalteam   = Boston Red Sox\n|statleague = MLB\n| stat1label  = [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|Win\u2013loss record]]\n| stat1value  = 98\u201388\n| stat2label  = [[Earned run average]]\n| stat2value  = 3.66\n| stat3label  = [[Strikeout]]s\n| stat3value  = 697\n| stat4label  = [[Save (baseball)|Saves]]\n| stat4value  = 66\n| teams       =\n* [[Philadelphia Athletics]] ({{mlby|1934}}\u2013{{mlby|1935}})\n* [[Detroit Tigers]] ({{mlby|1938}}\u2013{{mlby|1942}}, {{mlby|1945}}\u2013{{mlby|1948}})\n* [[Cleveland Indians]] ({{mlby|1949}}\u2013{{mlby|1950}})\n* [[Boston Red Sox]] ({{mlby|1952}})\n| highlights  =\n* 2\u00d7 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] ([[1941 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1941]], [[1942 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1942]])\n* [[World Series]] champion ([[1945 World Series|1945]])\n}}\n'''John Alton Benton''' (March 18, 1911 \u2013 April 14, 1968) was an American [[professional baseball]] [[pitcher]].

In 1955, the school transferred 20 blocks south to a newly built structure (the current building), on a large block of parkland. (The original 1908 building went through various uses before becoming [[Old Scona Academic High School]] in 1976.)\n\nStrathcona Composite is located on Edmonton\u2019s south side, just south of the [[Old Strathcona]] historic district.<ref name=HistArchive />\n\nThe school houses about 60 classrooms, several computer labs, two gymnasiums, a library media centre with networked CDs, a cafeteria, a fitness centre and a community pool operated by River City Recreation, a private contractor.<ref name=modernization /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sconapool.com/ |title=Scona Pool |publisher=RiverCity Recreation Inc. |access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> Outside the school, the track team uses Rollie Miles Athletic Field.

Price was selected [[List of first overall Major League Baseball draft picks|first overall]] in the [[2007 Major League Baseball draft]] by the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] and made his MLB debut in September 2008. He has also played for the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\nPrice pitched as a [[relief pitcher]] during the Rays' run through the [[2008 Major League Baseball season#Postseason|2008 playoffs]]. Weeks after his first appearance in the big leagues, he earned a [[save (baseball)|save]] in Game 7 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series]] (ALCS), helping the Rays reach their first [[World Series]]. Price became a full-time [[starting pitcher]] in 2009. In his second full season, he was named the [[American League]] starter for the [[2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2010 All-Star Game]] and finished second in the voting for the 2010 [[Cy Young Award]]. He won his first Cy Young Award in 2012.\n\nThe Rays traded Price to the Tigers during the 2014 season. When the Tigers fell out of the postseason race in 2015, they traded him to the Blue Jays, who won their division and advanced to the ALCS. That following off-season, the Red Sox signed Price to a franchise record seven-year, $217&nbsp;million contract. He won the series-clinching Game 5 as the Red Sox won the [[2018 World Series]] over the Dodgers. The Red Sox traded him to the Dodgers after the 2019 season.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Taylor Price was born in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].<ref name=vu>{{cite web|url=http://www.vucommodores.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/david_price_276129.html|title=David Price - 14|publisher=[[Vanderbilt Commodores]]|year=2014|accessdate=August 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003155434/http://www.vucommodores.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/david_price_276129.html|archive-date=October 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He has two brothers.<ref name=vu/> He began playing [[baseball]] in his early childhood.

baseball]] [[pitcher]] for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Price was selected [[List of first overall Major League Baseball draft picks|first overall]] in the [[2007 Major League Baseball draft]] by the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] and made his MLB debut in September 2008. He has also played for the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Boston Red Sox]].\n\nPrice pitched as a [[relief pitcher]] during the Rays' run through the [[2008 Major League Baseball season#Postseason|2008 playoffs]]. Weeks after his first appearance in the big leagues, he earned a [[save (baseball)|save]] in Game 7 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series]] (ALCS), helping the Rays reach their first [[World Series]]. Price became a full-time [[starting pitcher]] in 2009. In his second full season, he was named the [[American League]] starter for the [[2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2010 All-Star Game]] and finished second in the voting for the 2010 [[Cy Young Award]]. He won his first Cy Young Award in 2012.\n\nThe Rays traded Price to the Tigers during the 2014 season. When the Tigers fell out of the postseason race in 2015, they traded him to the Blue Jays, who won their division and advanced to the ALCS. That following off-season, the Red Sox signed Price to a franchise record seven-year, $217&nbsp;million contract. He won the series-clinching Game 5 as the Red Sox won the [[2018 World Series]] over the Dodgers. The Red Sox traded him to the Dodgers after the 2019 season.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Taylor Price was born in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].<ref name=vu>{{cite web|url=http://www.vucommodores.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/david_price_276129.html|title=David Price - 14|publisher=[[Vanderbilt Commodores]]|year=2014|accessdate=August 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003155434/http://www.vucommodores.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/david_price_276129.html|archive-date=October 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He has two brothers.<ref name=vu/> He began playing [[baseball]] in his early childhood.

He was relieved in the eighth inning with Boston leading, 5\u20131; [[Joe Kelly (pitcher)|Joe Kelly]] and Sale got the final six outs to clinch the World Series victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/10/28/david-price-changes-narrative-becomes-a-playoff-ace-for-red-sox-in-world-series-victory-over-dodgers/ |title=David Price changes narrative, becomes a playoff ace for Red Sox in World Series victory over Dodgers |first=Jeff |last=Fletcher |newspaper=[[Orange County Register]] |date=October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Boston Red Sox win 2018 World Series. |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-win-2018-world-series-title/c-299876586 |website=MLB.com |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=David Price continued his Fortnite tradition even through the long hours of the World Series |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2018/10/29/david-price-fortnite-world-series-eovaldi |website=Boston.com |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn October 31, prior to the Red Sox victory parade, Price announced that he would not exercise an opt-out clause in his contract, saying that he wants to win in Boston; \"We did that this year, and I want to do it again.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2018/10/31/david-price-red-sox-contract |title=David Price announces he\u2019s opting into his Red Sox contract |first=Nicole |last=Yang |website=[[Boston.com]] |date=October 31, 2018 |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}</ref> In early November, the New York City chapter of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA) announced Price as the [[Babe Ruth Award]] recipient, honoring the MLB player with the best performance in the postseason.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2018/11/03/jacob-degrom-and-david-price-honored-by-ny-baseball-writers/ |title=Jacob deGrom and David Price honored by NY baseball writers |website=[[New York Post]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=November 3, 2018 |accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref> Later in November, Price was announced as the AL [[Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2018/11/20/david-price-jonny-venters-earn-comeback-player-awards |title=David Price, Jonny Venters earn Comeback Player awards |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |website=[[Boston.com]] |date=November 20, 2018 |accessdate=November 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== 2019 season ====\nPrior to the season, Price announced that he was changing his [[Uniform number (Major League Baseball)|uniform number]] from 24 to 10, a tribute to his son Xavier, since \"X\" represents the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] ten.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Browne|first1=Ian|title=Unburdened Price ready to go back to back|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/david-price-wants-to-win-another-world-series/c-303947266|website=MLB.com|publisher=[[MLB]]|date=February 14, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2019}}</ref> Price began the season as a member of the starting rotation, pitching to a 1\u20132 record with 3.75 ERA in six starts, until being placed on the [[injured list]] on May 6, retroactive to May 3, due to left elbow [[tendinitis]].<ref name=TransMay/> He was activated on May 20,<ref name=TransMay>{{cite web |url=http://m.redsox.mlb.com/roster/transactions/2019/05 |title=Red Sox Roster & Staff \u2013 Transactions |website=[[MLB.com]] |date=May 2019 |accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref> starting and getting the win in a game against Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=401075434 |title=Red Sox vs. Blue Jays - Box Score |website=[[ESPN]] |date=May 20, 2019 |accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref> Price was briefly on the paternity list in early August,<ref name=TransAug/> as his wife gave birth to their second child;<ref name=birth2019/> at the time, he had a 7\u20134 record with 3.86 ERA in 20 starts, with 123 strikeouts in {{frac|102|2|3}} innings.

The film co stars [[Karyn Parsons]], [[Steven Martini]] and [[Michael Ironside]]. The film is a loose remake of the war film of 1955, ''[[The Private War of Major Benson]]'', starring [[Charlton Heston]]. The film was released in the United States on March 24, 1995.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] Major Benson Winifred Payne, a hardened Marine, returns from a violent but successful drug raid in South America, only to find out that he was once again not promoted to lieutenant colonel. Payne receives an [[honorable discharge]] on the grounds that \"the wars of the world are no longer fought on the battlefield\", and that his military skills are no longer needed.\n\nPayne tries to adjust to civilian life by making application to the police academy. He hits a man repeatedly during a training scenario, causing him to be arrested for assault after the man was rendered unconscious. His former general visits him and informs Payne that he has secured a job for him that will get him back in the military.\n\nPayne arrives at Madison Preparatory School in [[Virginia]], and is informed by the principal that his job is to train the [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] \"green boys\", a disorderly group of delinquents and outcasts who have placed last in the Virginia Military Games eight years running. \n\nWhen Payne sees his company, he immediately tells them that, under his direction, they will win the games at all costs, regardless of their various shortcomings: being overweight, sickly, deaf, cross-eyed, orphaned, or from a [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional home]]. Afterward, he shaves all their heads bald. Payne also meets and clashes with Emily Walburn, the Academy counsellor who tries to soften Payne's discipline with understanding and feelings, especially towards six year old orphan Tiger (Orlando Brown).\n\nPayne's training and punishments are harsh, which force the cadets to execute a series of failed schemes to get rid of Payne. Things come to a head when Payne offers them the chance to get rid of him, he will quit if they bring the Military Games trophy to Madison soil. The boys set out one night to Wellington Academy, the current trophy holder, to steal it. However, the Wellington cadets ambush them, and the boys return to school badly beaten (Payne having alerted Wellington via an \"anonymous call\").\n\nOutside of the academy, Payne bonds with Emily and Tiger. Returning to the Academy, Payne is confronted by lead misfit Alex Stone ([[Steven Martini]]) about his deception, but Payne claims it was to show them what the real prize was. With their desire to honestly earn the trophy added to their desire to be rid of Payne, the boys begin to train hard to win. \n\nWhen Stone's alcoholic, obnoxious stepfather appears unannounced and harasses Alex, Major Payne orders him away, granting Payne a lot of respect with the cadets. Stone and his friends want to win the Military games trophy, if just to have Payne gone. The cadets band together under Payne's regimen. Weeks later, Major Payne says they have graduated the program and are fit to compete in the games.\n\nPayne is asked to return to the Marines to fight in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], but his deployment means he will miss the Military Games and disappoint the boys and Emily. As he waits for his train, he sees a family together. Payne then imagines himself in a like scenario, realizing Tiger saw him as a father figure and that Payne is falling in love with Emily. \n\nAt the games, the boys are holding their own until a Wellington cadet trips up Alex during the race, spraining his ankle. Madison comes in second, but Alex's injury renders him unfit for the final event, a drill competition. In anger, the Madison cadets rumble with the Wellington cadets. The rumble is broken up, with the judges deliberating to have Madison disqualified for conduct unbecoming.\n\nHowever, Payne gives up his commission and shows up at the last minute, smooths things over with the referees and tells Tiger to lead Madison in drill. The group executes an unorthodox but entertaining routine which wins them the trophy.\n\nOn the first day of the new school year, Madison displays the Military Games trophy, along with another one for Alex Stone who won best individual participant. Payne resumes being an instructor, having married Emily and adopted Tiger. Stone resumes his role as a squad leader. He has softened quite a bit, telling the new recruits he's not only their commanding officer, but also their friend. When a new, disrespectful blind cadet shows up with his service dog, Payne shaves both him and his dog bald with his \"field knife,\" and laughs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Major]] Benson Winifred Payne\n* [[Karyn Parsons]] as Emily Walburn\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Dr. Phillips\n* [[Steven Martini]] as Cadet Alex J.

The film co stars [[Karyn Parsons]], [[Steven Martini]] and [[Michael Ironside]]. The film is a loose remake of the war film of 1955, ''[[The Private War of Major Benson]]'', starring [[Charlton Heston]]. The film was released in the United States on March 24, 1995.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] Major Benson Winifred Payne, a hardened Marine, returns from a violent but successful drug raid in South America, only to find out that he was once again not promoted to lieutenant colonel. Payne receives an [[honorable discharge]] on the grounds that \"the wars of the world are no longer fought on the battlefield\", and that his military skills are no longer needed.\n\nPayne tries to adjust to civilian life by making application to the police academy. He hits a man repeatedly during a training scenario, causing him to be arrested for assault after the man was rendered unconscious. His former general visits him and informs Payne that he has secured a job for him that will get him back in the military.\n\nPayne arrives at Madison Preparatory School in [[Virginia]], and is informed by the principal that his job is to train the [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] \"green boys\", a disorderly group of delinquents and outcasts who have placed last in the Virginia Military Games eight years running. \n\nWhen Payne sees his company, he immediately tells them that, under his direction, they will win the games at all costs, regardless of their various shortcomings: being overweight, sickly, deaf, cross-eyed, orphaned, or from a [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional home]]. Afterward, he shaves all their heads bald. Payne also meets and clashes with Emily Walburn, the Academy counsellor who tries to soften Payne's discipline with understanding and feelings, especially towards six year old orphan Tiger (Orlando Brown).\n\nPayne's training and punishments are harsh, which force the cadets to execute a series of failed schemes to get rid of Payne. Things come to a head when Payne offers them the chance to get rid of him, he will quit if they bring the Military Games trophy to Madison soil. The boys set out one night to Wellington Academy, the current trophy holder, to steal it. However, the Wellington cadets ambush them, and the boys return to school badly beaten (Payne having alerted Wellington via an \"anonymous call\").\n\nOutside of the academy, Payne bonds with Emily and Tiger. Returning to the Academy, Payne is confronted by lead misfit Alex Stone ([[Steven Martini]]) about his deception, but Payne claims it was to show them what the real prize was. With their desire to honestly earn the trophy added to their desire to be rid of Payne, the boys begin to train hard to win. \n\nWhen Stone's alcoholic, obnoxious stepfather appears unannounced and harasses Alex, Major Payne orders him away, granting Payne a lot of respect with the cadets. Stone and his friends want to win the Military games trophy, if just to have Payne gone. The cadets band together under Payne's regimen. Weeks later, Major Payne says they have graduated the program and are fit to compete in the games.\n\nPayne is asked to return to the Marines to fight in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], but his deployment means he will miss the Military Games and disappoint the boys and Emily. As he waits for his train, he sees a family together. Payne then imagines himself in a like scenario, realizing Tiger saw him as a father figure and that Payne is falling in love with Emily. \n\nAt the games, the boys are holding their own until a Wellington cadet trips up Alex during the race, spraining his ankle. Madison comes in second, but Alex's injury renders him unfit for the final event, a drill competition. In anger, the Madison cadets rumble with the Wellington cadets. The rumble is broken up, with the judges deliberating to have Madison disqualified for conduct unbecoming.\n\nHowever, Payne gives up his commission and shows up at the last minute, smooths things over with the referees and tells Tiger to lead Madison in drill. The group executes an unorthodox but entertaining routine which wins them the trophy.\n\nOn the first day of the new school year, Madison displays the Military Games trophy, along with another one for Alex Stone who won best individual participant. Payne resumes being an instructor, having married Emily and adopted Tiger. Stone resumes his role as a squad leader. He has softened quite a bit, telling the new recruits he's not only their commanding officer, but also their friend. When a new, disrespectful blind cadet shows up with his service dog, Payne shaves both him and his dog bald with his \"field knife,\" and laughs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Major]] Benson Winifred Payne\n* [[Karyn Parsons]] as Emily Walburn\n* [[William Hickey]] as Dr. Phillips\n* [[Steven Martini]] as Cadet Alex J.

The first six years of the contract cover his arbitration years, with three more years added by team options. If the team exercises its one-year option for 2014, and then its two-year option for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, the deal could be worth up to $44 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8676611/evan-longoria-tampa-bay-rays-agree-100-million-extension|title=Longoria, Rays agree to $100 million extension|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Chastain |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080418&content_id=2546402&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Rays sign Longoria to multiyear contract |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=April 18, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> There is a general consensus that this contract is among the most team-friendly, in terms of [[dollars]] per [[Wins Above Replacement]], in Major League Baseball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/2010-trade-value-5-1/|title=2010 Trade Value: #5 \u2013 #1 {{!}} FanGraphs Baseball|website=www.fangraphs.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\nOn July 10, Longoria won the 2008 All-Star game AL Final Fan vote over [[outfielder]] [[Jermaine Dye]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]], [[outfielder]] [[Jos\u00e9 Guill\u00e9n]] of the Kansas City Royals, [[first baseman]] [[Jason Giambi]] of the New York Yankees, and [[second baseman]] [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]] of the Baltimore Orioles.
