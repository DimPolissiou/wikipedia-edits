If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

Today the answer print is made for both of these two different media. ...Having these two different media, with essentially two different aspect ratios, each of us (directors, production designers, cinematographers, camera Operators, etc.) shares the nightmare of compromising the composition of the Image. Looking through a viewfinder, a camera, or a monitor, we are always faced with at least two images of the same subject.\"<ref name=\"Univisium\">Storaro, Vittorio and Storaro, Fabrizio (1998). [http://www.cinematography.net/Files/univision.pdf ''Univisium''].</ref>\n\nStoraro feels in the future of cinema, films will be photographed in either high-definition video for small, intimate digital projection theaters, or in 65&nbsp;mm for \"big audience... large screen\" films.<ref name=\"Univisium\" /> In the cinematographer's opinion, as all films will be one of the two formats, he suggests a common aspect ratio compromise of 2.00:1 (mathematical average of 65&nbsp;mm 2.20:1 and HD 1.78:1) be adopted for all films, 65&nbsp;mm theatrical, HD theatrical and television.\n\nAs he told ''American Cinematographer'' writer Bob Fisher, \"I believe it is very important for audiences to see films exactly the way they were composed by the director and cinematographer. This is a solution.\"<ref name=\"guiding\">Fisher, Bob (February 2001). \"Guiding Light\" ''American Cinematographer Magazine''. pp. 72-83</ref>\n\n==35 mm Univisium camera proposal==\n[[File:Univisium-simulated-digital-sound.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A simulated strip of 35 mm film in the proposed Univisium 2.00:1 [[Negative pulldown|3-perf]] format with two digital [[sound-on-film|soundtracks]] present. At far left and far right, outside the perforations, is the [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] soundtrack as an image of a digital signal. Between the perforations (on the left side) is the [[Dolby Digital]] soundtrack (note the tiny Dolby \"Double D\" logo in the center of each area between the perforations).]]\n\nStoraro recognized that ubiquitous HD origination was not yet viable and therefore proposed an alteration to standard 35&nbsp;mm photography to create a 2.00:1 aspect ratio and economize on film.\n\nBy using a negative area similar to that of the [[Super 35]] frame (which utilizes the full width of a 35&nbsp;mm film frame \"perf-to-perf\" as opposed to traditional 35&nbsp;mm which utilizes a smaller area of the 35&nbsp;mm frame offset to the right to accommodate space for an [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]]) combined with [[3-perf]] frame size (as opposed to standard 35&nbsp;mm photography which uses four perforations per frame). The Univisium camera would use an aperture opening of 24mm \u00d7 12mm (.945\" \u00d7 .472\") and three perforations per frame,<ref name=\"Univisium\" /> which would eliminate the waste associated with 2.40:1 Super 35&nbsp;mm photography (wherein nearly 50% of the frame is discarded){{Citation needed|reason=As far as I know, parts of the frame are discarded when using two-perf Techniscope. By using anamorphic lenses, \"proper\" widescreen, all four perfs are used|date=September 2016}} by creating a natural 2.00:1 aspect ratio utilizing the whole film area.\n\nIn addition to using the full film area, using three perforations per frame as opposed to four equates to using 25% less film for the same shooting time.  With the traditional four perforations per frame, 35&nbsp;mm film (at 24 frames per second) runs at 90 feet per minute (4 minutes 26 seconds per 400 feet of film), three perforations per frame runs at 67.5 feet per minute (5 minutes 56 seconds per 400 feet of film).<ref>Holben, Jay & Bankston, Douglas (February 2000). \"Inventive New Options for Film\" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' pp. 105-107</ref> This would mean each magazine of film would have 33% more shooting time and a production that shot the same overall length of time as a four-perforation film would use 25% less film.\n\nThe proposal also points out that the 2.00:1 aspect ratio can be achieved using standard spherical lenses, which, compared to their anamorphic counterparts, are cheaper, faster (require less light), and have more photographic [[depth of field]] and less visual imperfections.  There are also a greater selection of spherical prime and zoom lenses than there are anamorphic lenses.\n\n3-perf also results in a quieter camera than 4-perf as there is less [[intermittent movement]] per frame.\n\nThe format also calls for shooting 25 frames per second, which eliminates problems associated with transferring film to video in the [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] system and is still fairly simple to transfer to the [[NTSC]] video format.\n\n===35 mm Univisium projection proposal===\nStoraro suggests a renovation to standard film projectors to present a 3-perf frame and eliminate the need for an anamorphic print to be made (to optically squeeze the 2:1 3-perf aspect ratio into a 1.33:1 4-perf frame).  As the image will fill the full film area (perf-to-perf) there is no room for a traditional optical soundtrack and Univisium requires two digital soundtracks, one for backup (which reside outside of the perforations on the edge of the film; [[Digital Theater System|DTS]], [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound]], [[Dolby Digital]]).  The projectors would run at 25 frames per second, just as the cameras do.<ref name=\"Univisium\" />\n\nAs a compromise to standard technology (for the time being), Storaro says an anamorphic print can be made and presented in 24 frames per second with a digital and/or optical soundtrack. However, with the rise of the DCP (Digital Cinema Package), the 2:1 image can be projected from a ''flat'' (1.85:1) container in either 2K (1998x1080) or 4K (3996x2160)\n\n==Univisium in use==\nAlthough no film has utilized the full aspects of the proposal, particularly with regard to the projection standards, Storaro has since used Univisium for nearly all of his films.\n\nTechnovision<ref>Kodak ''In Camera Magazine''.

Retrieved 2007-06-11.</ref> This has proved controversial with many film enthusiasts, who believe that regardless of Storaro's attempt to unify all aspect ratios, films should be viewed in the ratio they were filmed in, without any cropping. Due to this backlash, ''Apocalypse Now'' and ''Reds'' use their original aspect ratios for Blu-ray release.\n\nOther films that were reframed to the Univisium aspect ratio on DVD include the 1998 DVD release of ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986), the 1999 & 2004 DVDs of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), and the original DVD release of ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997).\n\nMany trailers of upcoming films from ''[[20th Century Studios]]'' that are shot in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio are cropped to this format when they play ahead of any movies that were shot in 1.85:1.\n\nAccording to IMDB technical specification statistics, there are over 700 titles with 2:1 aspect ratios, and the number has been growing in recent years.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/interfaces</ref>\n\nNetflix production and post-production requirements state that they prefer content up to 2:1 aspect ratio anything wider must be evaluated and discussed.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000579527-Cameras-and-Image-Capture |title = Cameras and Image Capture}}</ref>\n\n===Aspect ratio used in music videos===\n\n*[[Miranda Cosgrove]]: ''[[Kissin U]]'' (2010)\n*[[Girls' Generation]]: ''[[Hoot (song)|Hoot (\ud6d7)]]'' (2010)\n*[[Shawn Mendes]] and [[Camila Cabello]]: ''[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]'' (2019)\n*[[Megan Thee Stallion]] feat.
