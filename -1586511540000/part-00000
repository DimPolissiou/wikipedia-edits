They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored 5 championship points.\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Osella PA5 BMW.jpg|thumb|Osella placed second in the [[1977 World Championship for Sports Cars]] with the Osella PA5 BMW.]]\nNamed after its founder Vincenzo \"Enzo\" Osella, the team began life by racing [[Abarth]] [[sports car racing|sports car]]s in local and national races in Italy in the mid-1960s. Though relatively successful (Osella eventually took over the factory Abarth sports car program), Osella expanded into single-seater racing in 1974 to further develop his business. In 1975, the team entered the [[1975 European Formula Two Championship|European Formula Two Championship]] for the first time, achieving some success with its own car, the [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]]-powered Osella FA2.\n\nOsella continued in Formula Two in [[1976 European Formula Two Championship|1976]], but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss Charly Kiser.\n\n==The late 1970s==\nEnzo Osella tried to make some money by selling a self-penned [[Formula Three]] car, the Osella FA3, with little success. Only a few privateers were optimistic enough to buy the simple, untested machine, which with [[Toyota]] or [[Lancia]] engines competed in the 1976 [[Germany|German]] and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978.\n\nOsella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979]], with American driver [[Eddie Cheever]] racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. This was enough for Enzo Osella to take the plunge into the cut-and-thrust world of [[Formula One]].\n\n==Formula One==\n\n===Early years===\nOsella Squadra Corse appeared in the world of Grand Prix racing with its first Formula One machine, the FA1. The car was designed by [[Giorgio Stirano]]. Powered by [[Ford Cosworth DFV]], it was overweight and aerodynamically inefficient. The car was presented in a blue and white livery with large [[Denim (label)|Denim]] branding on the sidepods. Many components were manufactured in-house which meant that they were cheap to produce but not always state-of-the-art. The driver was again Eddie Cheever who was able to finish just one race in whole season. Frequently, he had to suffer from the massive unreliability of his car. In the following seasons, the basic design was changed several times.\n\nIn the early years, most of the work was done by interim designers like [[Giorgio Valentini]] or [[Tony Southgate]], but frequently Enzo Osella himself also worked on the cars. Most of these attempts brought no improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] finished fourth at [[San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] in [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|1982]] (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C.\n\nDespite this result, neither the financial nor the technical situation improved. Few [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] were attracted by the tiny Italian team. Denim only stayed for the first two seasons, [[Kelemata]] was no more reliable, and others like [[Landis & Gyr]] vanished as quickly as they had come. Most of the other sponsors were small or mid-size companies from [[Turin]] or the region of [[Piemont]].\n\n===Driver changes===\n[[File:Osella FA1D Bournemouth WHEELS Festival 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Osella FA1D at [[Bournemouth]] in 2016.]]\nThe lack of funding led to frequent driver changes as the team demanded that their drivers bring significant sponsorship to keep the team afloat. Some drivers started their F1 careers at Osella, such as [[Alex Caffi]] and [[Gabriele Tarquini]], while [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] had four stints with the team. Others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as [[Allen Berg]] and [[Franco Forini]]. Enzo Osella gave the young Austrian [[Jo Gartner]] his one and only chance to drive a Formula One car in 1984. [[Riccardo Paletti]] also had high hopes, but was killed in a start-line accident at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\nNone of these drivers were able to push the team forward. Finally, Osella continued to live hand-to-mouth each year, with little or no improvement in competitiveness.\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[File:Ghinzani Osella FA1F 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Alfa-Romeo derived FA1F at the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix]], where Ghinzani achieved Osella's second and last points finish.]]\nIn the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines, both in [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] (1983\u201384) and [[Turbocharger|turbo]] (1984\u201388) forms. On one hand, the Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era; on the other hand, the heavy, unreliable and thirsty machines contributed to the team's lack of competitiveness. At least at first, Alfa offered some technical input to the team; the 1984 Osella FA1F was based on the 1983 works [[Alfa Romeo 183T]], which had been loaned to the team for \"design assistance\" purposes. All the following Osella models up to the [[Osella FA1L|FA1L]] in {{f1|1988}} had their origins in the initial Alfa design.\n\nThe Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Chargers blew off regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. On more than one occasion, Osella tried to replace the 890T with more up-to-date [[Motori Moderni]] turbos (which [[Minardi]] did not support) or with [[Cosworth]] engines. In the end, both were too expensive, so Osella had to stick with the increasingly outdated but cheap 890T.\n\nFor 1988 \u2013 the last year before turbos were banned \u2013 the team re-branded the 890T as the \"Osella V8\". This came about after Alfa's parent company, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat]], grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used.\n\nAfter driver [[Nicola Larini]] managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the reality was that the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge: Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the [[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella was more than happy to be finally rid of the old Alfa engine.\n\n===Cosworth power and Fondmetal===\nThe 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, [[Cosworth DFV#DFR|Cosworth DFR]]-powered [[Osella FA1M]] was a big step ahead, and ultra-sticky qualifying [[tyres]] from [[Pirelli]] brought some success, at least in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the [[Lotus 101|Lotus]] of [[Nelson Piquet]] left Ghinzani with an injured ankle.\n\nIn 1990, after ten years in Formula One and still without any meaningful sponsorship, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate [[Gabriele Rumi]], as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi's [[Fondmetal]] company. During {{f1|1990}}, the team entered a single car for French driver [[Olivier Grouillard]], who gained a reputation in F1 for being a \"blocker\", holding up faster cars and ignoring his mirrors. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal.\n\n==Sportscars==\n[[File:Osella PA 20 S BMW.jpg|thumb|right|BMW-powered Osella PA20]]The involvement of Gabriele Rumi meant the end of Enzo Osella's activities in Formula One. Instead he concentrated on the thing he knew best: sports car racing. During his Formula One years, he never gave up building sports cars; in fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races, with [[Maurpo Nesti]] many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models.\n\nA few of those sports cars even found their way to the [[Can Am]] series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels.\n\nIn the 1990s, Osella moved to [[Atella, Basilicata|Atella]] in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races. In 1995 for instance works team driver [[Pasquale Irlando]] won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA18. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor [[Fabio Danti]] died in one of Osella's cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship.

They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored 5 championship points.\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Osella PA5 BMW.jpg|thumb|Osella placed second in the [[1977 World Championship for Sports Cars]] with the Osella PA5 BMW.]]\nNamed after its founder Vincenzo \"Enzo\" Osella, the team began life by racing [[Abarth]] [[sports car racing|sports car]]s in local and national races in Italy in the mid-1960s. Though relatively successful (Osella eventually took over the factory Abarth sports car program), Osella expanded into single-seater racing in 1974 to further develop his business. In 1975, the team entered the [[1975 European Formula Two Championship|European Formula Two Championship]] for the first time, achieving some success with its own car, the [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]]-powered Osella FA2.\n\nOsella continued in Formula Two in [[1976 European Formula Two Championship|1976]], but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss Charly Kiser.\n\n==The late 1970s==\nEnzo Osella tried to make some money by selling a self-penned [[Formula Three]] car, the Osella FA3, with little success. Only a few privateers were optimistic enough to buy the simple, untested machine, which with [[Toyota]] or [[Lancia]] engines competed in the 1976 [[Germany|German]] and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978.\n\nOsella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979]], with American driver [[Eddie Cheever]] racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. This was enough for Enzo Osella to take the plunge into the cut-and-thrust world of [[Formula One]].\n\n==Formula One==\n\n===Early years===\nOsella Squadra Corse appeared in the world of Grand Prix racing with its first Formula One machine, the FA1. The car was designed by [[Giorgio Stirano]]. Powered by [[Ford Cosworth DFV]], it was overweight and aerodynamically inefficient. The car was presented in a blue and white livery with large [[Denim (label)|Denim]] branding on the sidepods. Many components were manufactured in-house which meant that they were cheap to produce but not always state-of-the-art. The driver was again Eddie Cheever who was able to finish just one race in whole season. Frequently, he had to suffer from the massive unreliability of his car. In the following seasons, the basic design was changed several times.\n\nIn the early years, most of the work was done by interim designers like [[Giorgio Valentini]] or [[Tony Southgate]], but frequently Enzo Osella himself also worked on the cars. Most of these attempts brought no improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] finished fourth at [[San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] in [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|1982]] (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C.\n\nDespite this result, neither the financial nor the technical situation improved. Few [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] were attracted by the tiny Italian team. Denim only stayed for the first two seasons, [[Kelemata]] was no more reliable, and others like [[Landis & Gyr]] vanished as quickly as they had come. Most of the other sponsors were small or mid-size companies from [[Turin]] or the region of [[Piemont]].\n\n===Driver changes===\n[[File:Osella FA1D Bournemouth WHEELS Festival 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Osella FA1D at [[Bournemouth]] in 2016.]]\nThe lack of funding led to frequent driver changes as the team demanded that their drivers bring significant sponsorship to keep the team afloat. Some drivers started their F1 careers at Osella, such as [[Alex Caffi]] and [[Gabriele Tarquini]], while [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] had four stints with the team. Others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as [[Allen Berg]] and [[Franco Forini]]. Enzo Osella gave the young Austrian [[Jo Gartner]] his one and only chance to drive a Formula One car in 1984. [[Riccardo Paletti]] also had high hopes, but was killed in a start-line accident at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\nNone of these drivers were able to push the team forward. Finally, Osella continued to live hand-to-mouth each year, with little or no improvement in competitiveness.\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[File:Ghinzani Osella FA1F 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Alfa-Romeo derived FA1F at the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix]], where Ghinzani achieved Osella's second and last points finish.]]\nIn the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines, both in [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] (1983\u201384) and [[Turbocharger|turbo]] (1984\u201388) forms. On one hand, the Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era; on the other hand, the heavy, unreliable and thirsty machines contributed to the team's lack of competitiveness. At least at first, Alfa offered some technical input to the team; the 1984 Osella FA1F was based on the 1983 works [[Alfa Romeo 183T]], which had been loaned to the team for \"design assistance\" purposes. All the following Osella models up to the [[Osella FA1L|FA1L]] in {{f1|1988}} had their origins in the initial Alfa design.\n\nThe Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Chargers blew off regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. On more than one occasion, Osella tried to replace the 890T with more up-to-date [[Motori Moderni]] turbos (which [[Minardi]] did not support) or with [[Cosworth]] engines. In the end, both were too expensive, so Osella had to stick with the increasingly outdated but cheap 890T.\n\nFor 1988 \u2013 the last year before turbos were banned \u2013 the team re-branded the 890T as the \"Osella V8\". This came about after Alfa's parent company, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat]], grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used.\n\nAfter driver [[Nicola Larini]] managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the reality was that the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge: Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the [[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella was more than happy to be finally rid of the old Alfa engine.\n\n===Cosworth power and Fondmetal===\nThe 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, [[Cosworth DFV#DFR|Cosworth DFR]]-powered [[Osella FA1M]] was a big step ahead, and ultra-sticky qualifying [[tyres]] from [[Pirelli]] brought some success, at least in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the [[Lotus 101|Lotus]] of [[Nelson Piquet]] left Ghinzani with an injured ankle.\n\nIn 1990, after ten years in Formula One and still without any meaningful sponsorship, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate [[Gabriele Rumi]], as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi's [[Fondmetal]] company. During {{f1|1990}}, the team entered a single car for French driver [[Olivier Grouillard]], who gained a reputation in F1 for being a \"blocker\", holding up faster cars and ignoring his mirrors. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal.\n\n==Sportscars==\n[[File:Osella PA 20 S BMW.jpg|thumb|right|BMW-powered Osella PA20]]The involvement of Gabriele Rumi meant the end of Enzo Osella's activities in Formula One. Instead he concentrated on the thing he knew best: sports car racing. During his Formula One years, he never gave up building sports cars; in fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races, with [[Maurpo Nesti]] many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models.\n\nA few of those sports cars even found their way to the [[Can Am]] series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels.\n\nIn the 1990s, Osella moved to [[Atella, Basilicata|Atella]] in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races. In 1995 for instance works team driver [[Pasquale Irlando]] won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA18. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor [[Fabio Danti]] died in one of Osella's cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship.

James claims that the formation of Hacktivist was a \"fluke\", with no intention of developing such a style, but the group was born when peer J Hurley, a local rapper with little history in the metal scene, began recording vocals over some of James' demos.<ref>[http://metalmouth.net/2013/01/hacktivist/ Interview with Hacktivist] Metal Mouth. January 15, 2013. Retrieved August 6, 2013.</ref> After the demos became very popular online, James decided to recruit a full lineup, bringing in Richard Hawking on drums, Josh Gurner (ex-[[Sacred Mother Tongue]]) on bass and Ben Marvin (James's former bandmate in Heart Of A Coward) as a second vocalist. The band began work on an [[extended play|EP]] in 2012 and debut single \"Unlike Us\" reached No. 2 in the Amazon UK metal chart within 48 hours.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/01/hactivist-uniting-people-djent Hacktivist: 'We're uniting a lot of people'] [[The Guardian]]. 1 November 2012. Retrieved 6 August 2013.</ref> Despite being released independently on 12 November 2012, the band's self-titled EP proved popular in the metal media with [[Metal Hammer]] in particular giving the band significant coverage<ref>[http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/new-music-monday-hacktivist/ New Music Monday: Hacktivist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185026/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/new-music-monday-hacktivist/ |date=2013-10-29 }} [[Metal Hammer]]. October 8, 2012. Retrieved August 6, 2013.</ref> and considerable airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].\n\nAfter the release of the ''Hacktivist'' EP, the band set out to tour. This included supporting slots for acts such as [[Enter Shikari]] and [[Korn]] and performances in European festivals such as [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[Download Festival]] and [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] in summer 2013. In April 2013 the group released a new song \"Elevate\", with an accompanying video, for free download<ref>[http://metalmouth.net/2013/04/hacktivist-debut-video-and-offer-free-download/ HACKTIVIST Debut New Video And Offer Free Download] Metal Mouth. 8 April 2013. Retrieved 6 August 2013.</ref> and this was followed up in August with a cover of \"[[Niggas In Paris]]\" (originally by [[Jay-Z]] and [[Kanye West]]). A video for \"Niggas In Paris\" was filmed during their set at Download Festival 2013. They also performed a live session for BBC Radio 1 at [[Maida Vale Studios]].\n\nThe band headed out on a UK headline tour throughout winter 2013, supported by [[The Algorithm]]. A re-release of their debut EP with 4 bonus tracks was released on 11 November 2013.\n\nThe band has shown support for hacktivism collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], and appear to support \"whistle-blowers\" [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Chelsea Manning]] whom they reference in the song 'Cold Shoulders'.\n\nOn 4 August 2014 Hacktivist released the single and video for \"False Idols\". Lots of references to activism (especially hacktivist collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]) are made throughout the video and within hours the song had reached number 1 on the [[iTunes]] Metal chart. This release was followed on 12 November by \"Deceive and Defy\" (also accompanied by a video), featuring Charlie Holmes of [[Heart in Hand (band)|Heart in Hand]] on vocals. Hacktivist then toured the UK from November to December, supported by Dead Harts and the One Hundred.\n\nFollowing the release of the single \"Buszy\" on 17 January 2016, their debut studio album ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' was released on 4 March 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/41212/hacktivist-stream-debut-album-outside-the-box/|title=Hacktivist Stream Debut Album, Outside The Box - Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-20}}</ref>\n\nOn the 20th of January 2017, it was announced that Hacktivist and Ben Marvin were parting ways due to Ben's family commitments,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Hacktivistband/posts/1395628160468144|title=Hacktivist on Facebook: We are sad to announce the departure of founding member and vocalist Ben Marvin|website=Facebook|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref> and rapper/vocalist Jot Maxi was brought in as the new co-vocalist.\n\nMay 31, 2017 saw the release of single '2 Rotten' with an accompanying video. The track was essentially a heavier remix of track 'Rotten' from ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' but with Jot Maxi taking a leading role as opposed to the 16 bar feature slot he had in the original. The single was well received despite the video not achieving as many YouTube views as previous releases, with the general census across social media being that Jot is a welcome addition to the band and that a 2nd album is eagerly anticipated by fans.\n\nOn the 28th of March 2018 it was announced that Hacktivist and Timfy James had parted ways. Following on from this the band recruited James Hewitt (of bands 'Invocation' and 'Exist Immortal') as their new guitarist and producer with an official announcement made on the 19th of January 2019. Hewitt had been playing live and writing new material with the band since June 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Hacktivistband/posts/2262978300399788|title=Hacktivist on Facebook: We are beyond excited and proud to FINALLY be able to announce our new guitarist & producer JAMES HEWITT!|website=Facebook|language=en-UK|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref> As a result, Josh Gurner would provide clean vocals following Timfy James' departure.\n\nThe band embarked on a headline UK tour in Jan/Feb 2019 and went on to release the single 'Reprogram' with accompanying video on the 10th of April 2019.\n\n==Musical style==\nHacktivist's music is a blend of several different styles. They are noted for using 8 string guitars and 6 string basses both tuned down to Drop E to achieve an extremely low tuned, distorted and dark sound, as well as ambient passages and a \"wall of sound\" production style. Their vocals are primarily [[rapping|rapped]], although they also make use of conventional singing and occasional [[harsh vocals]]. They write their lyrics collectively, focusing on political subjects such as [[anarchism]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[government corruption]], [[censorship]], anti-gun violence, unity against oppression and other social and economic issues.\n\nThe band's music has been described as [[rap metal]]<ref name=metalinjection>{{cite

released a self-titled EP in 2012, followed by their debut studio album ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' in 2016.\n\n==History==\nHacktivist began in 2011 when former guitarist Timfy James left his previous band 'Heart of a Coward'. James claims that the formation of Hacktivist was a \"fluke\", with no intention of developing such a style, but the group was born when peer J Hurley, a local rapper with little history in the metal scene, began recording vocals over some of James' demos.<ref>[http://metalmouth.net/2013/01/hacktivist/ Interview with Hacktivist] Metal Mouth. January 15, 2013. Retrieved August 6, 2013.</ref> After the demos became very popular online, James decided to recruit a full lineup, bringing in Richard Hawking on drums, Josh Gurner (ex-[[Sacred Mother Tongue]]) on bass and Ben Marvin (James's former bandmate in Heart Of A Coward) as a second vocalist. The band began work on an [[extended play|EP]] in 2012 and debut single \"Unlike Us\" reached No. 2 in the Amazon UK metal chart within 48 hours.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/01/hactivist-uniting-people-djent Hacktivist: 'We're uniting a lot of people'] [[The Guardian]]. 1 November 2012. Retrieved 6 August 2013.</ref> Despite being released independently on 12 November 2012, the band's self-titled EP proved popular in the metal media with [[Metal Hammer]] in particular giving the band significant coverage<ref>[http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/new-music-monday-hacktivist/ New Music Monday: Hacktivist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185026/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/new-music-monday-hacktivist/ |date=2013-10-29 }} [[Metal Hammer]]. October 8, 2012. Retrieved August 6, 2013.</ref> and considerable airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].\n\nAfter the release of the ''Hacktivist'' EP, the band set out to tour. This included supporting slots for acts such as [[Enter Shikari]] and [[Korn]] and performances in European festivals such as [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[Download Festival]] and [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] in summer 2013. In April 2013 the group released a new song \"Elevate\", with an accompanying video, for free download<ref>[http://metalmouth.net/2013/04/hacktivist-debut-video-and-offer-free-download/ HACKTIVIST Debut New Video And Offer Free Download] Metal Mouth. 8 April 2013. Retrieved 6 August 2013.</ref> and this was followed up in August with a cover of \"[[Niggas In Paris]]\" (originally by [[Jay-Z]] and [[Kanye West]]). A video for \"Niggas In Paris\" was filmed during their set at Download Festival 2013. They also performed a live session for BBC Radio 1 at [[Maida Vale Studios]].\n\nThe band headed out on a UK headline tour throughout winter 2013, supported by [[The Algorithm]]. A re-release of their debut EP with 4 bonus tracks was released on 11 November 2013.\n\nThe band has shown support for hacktivism collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], and appear to support \"whistle-blowers\" [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Chelsea Manning]] whom they reference in the song 'Cold Shoulders'.\n\nOn 4 August 2014 Hacktivist released the single and video for \"False Idols\". Lots of references to activism (especially hacktivist collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]) are made throughout the video and within hours the song had reached number 1 on the [[iTunes]] Metal chart. This release was followed on 12 November by \"Deceive and Defy\" (also accompanied by a video), featuring Charlie Holmes of [[Heart in Hand (band)|Heart in Hand]] on vocals. Hacktivist then toured the UK from November to December, supported by Dead Harts and the One Hundred.\n\nFollowing the release of the single \"Buszy\" on 17 January 2016, their debut studio album ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' was released on 4 March 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/41212/hacktivist-stream-debut-album-outside-the-box/|title=Hacktivist Stream Debut Album, Outside The Box - Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-20}}</ref>\n\nOn the 20th of January 2017, it was announced that Hacktivist and Ben Marvin were parting ways due to Ben's family commitments,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Hacktivistband/posts/1395628160468144|title=Hacktivist on Facebook: We are sad to announce the departure of founding member and vocalist Ben Marvin|website=Facebook|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref> and rapper/vocalist Jot Maxi was brought in as the new co-vocalist.\n\nMay 31, 2017 saw the release of single '2 Rotten' with an accompanying video. The track was essentially a heavier remix of track 'Rotten' from ''[[Outside the Box (Hacktivist album)|Outside the Box]]'' but with Jot Maxi taking a leading role as opposed to the 16 bar feature slot he had in the original. The single was well received despite the video not achieving as many YouTube views as previous releases, with the general census across social media being that Jot is a welcome addition to the band and that a 2nd album is eagerly anticipated by fans.\n\nOn the 28th of March 2018 it was announced that Hacktivist and Timfy James had parted ways. Following on from this the band recruited James Hewitt (of bands 'Invocation' and 'Exist Immortal') as their new guitarist and producer with an official announcement made on the 19th of January 2019. Hewitt had been playing live and writing new material with the band since June 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Hacktivistband/posts/2262978300399788|title=Hacktivist on Facebook: We are beyond excited and proud to FINALLY be able to announce our new guitarist & producer JAMES HEWITT!|website=Facebook|language=en-UK|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref> As a result, Josh Gurner would provide clean vocals following Timfy James' departure.\n\nThe band embarked on a headline UK tour in Jan/Feb 2019 and went on to release the single 'Reprogram' with accompanying video on the 10th of April 2019.\n\n==Musical style==\nHacktivist's music is a blend of several different styles. They are noted for using 8 string guitars and 6 string basses both tuned down to Drop E to achieve an extremely low tuned, distorted and dark sound, as well as ambient passages and a \"wall of sound\" production style. Their vocals are primarily [[rapping|rapped]], although they also make use of conventional singing and occasional [[harsh vocals]]. They write their lyrics collectively, focusing on political subjects such as [[anarchism]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[government corruption]], [[censorship]], anti-gun violence, unity against oppression and other social and economic issues.\n\nThe band's music has been described as [[rap metal]]<ref name=metalinjection>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/editorials/is-nu-djent-the-next-big-thing|title=Is N\u00fc-Djent The Next Big Thing?|last=Pasbani|first=Robert|publisher=Metal Injection|date=5 May 2014|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"RS India\">{{cite web|url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/hacktivist-metal-band-fleshgod-apocalypse-debut-big69-festival-mumbai/|title=UK\u2019s Hacktivist, Italian Metallers Fleshgod Apocalypse Announced for Mumbai\u2019s BIG69 Festival|website=[[Rolling Stone]] India|date=5 November 2014|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> and [[Grime (music)|grime]],<ref name=\"RS India\" /> as fusing [[djent]] and [[nu metal]],<ref name=\"metalinjection\" /><ref name=\"nocleansinging\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nocleansinging.com/2012/11/09/hacktivist/|title=Hacktivist|author=Islander|publisher=No Clean Singing|date=9 November 2012|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> or more generally as adding rapping to djent.<ref name=\"nocleansinging\" /><ref name=metalsucks>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/10/17/djent-rappers-hacktivist-kind-enough-to-put-the-word-hack-right-there-in-the-name/|title=Djent-rappers Hacktivist Kind Enough to Put the Word Hack Right There in the Name|last=Rosenberg|first=Axl|publisher=[[MetalSucks]]|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> They have also been said to use elements of [[groove metal]].<ref name=\"nocleansinging\" /> Their guitar compositions have been described as reminiscent of both [[Meshuggah]] and nu metal bands such as [[Limp Bizkit]] and [[Korn]].<ref name=\"metalsucks\" />\n\n==Members==\n;Current\n* Jermaine 'J' Hurley \u2013 [[rapping]] <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n* Josh Gurner \u2013 [[bass guitar|bass]] <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>, [[clean vocals]] <small>(2018\u2013present)</small>\n* Richard Hawking \u2013 [[drum kit|drums]] <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n* Jot Maxi -
