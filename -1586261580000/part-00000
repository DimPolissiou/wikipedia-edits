Sheen 1956.JPG|thumb|[[Archbishop Fulton Sheen]], one of the most popular [[Catholic]] televangelists of all time]]\n\n'''Televangelism''' ([[wikt:tele-|tele-]] \"distance\" and \"[[evangelism]],\" meaning \"[[Christian ministry|ministry]],\" sometimes called '''teleministry''') is the use of media, specifically [[radio]] and [[television]], to communicate [[Christianity]]. \nTelevangelists are [[minister (Christianity)|ministers]], whether official, or largely self-proclaimed, who devote a large portion of their ministry to television [[broadcast]]ing. Some televangelists are also regular [[pastor]]s or ministers in their own places of worship (often a [[megachurch]]), but the majority of their followers come from TV and radio audiences. Others do not have a conventional congregation, and work primarily through television. The term is also used derisively by critics as an insinuation of aggrandizement by such ministers.\n\nTelevangelism began as a uniquely American phenomenon, resulting from a [[Television in the United States|largely deregulated media]] where access to [[television network]]s and [[cable TV]] is open to virtually anyone who can afford it, combined with a [[Christianity in the United States|large Christian population]] that is able to provide the necessary funding. It became especially popular among [[Evangelical Protestant]] audiences, whether independent or organized around Christian denominations. However, the increasing globalisation of broadcasting has enabled some American televangelists to reach a wider audience through international broadcast networks, including some that are specifically Christian in nature, such as [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and [[The God Channel]]. Domestically produced televangelism is increasingly present in some other nations such as [[Brazil]].\n\nSome countries have a more regulated media with either general restrictions on access or specific rules regarding religious broadcasting. In such countries, religious programming is typically produced by TV companies (sometimes as a regulatory or public service requirement) rather than private [[interest group]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word ''televangelism'' is a [[portmanteau]] of [[television]] and [[evangelism]] and it was coined in 1958 as the title of a television miniseries by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].<ref name=Stewart>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Tim|title=televangelism|url=http://www.dictionaryofchristianese.com/televangelism/|website=Dictionary of Christianese|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref> [[Jeffrey K. Hadden]] and Charles E. Swann have been credited with popularising the word in their 1981 survey ''Prime Time Preachers: The Rising Power of Televangelism''.<ref>Jeffrey K. Hadden and Charles E. Swann, ''Prime Time Preachers: The Rising Power of Televangelism''. Addison-Wesley, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0201038859}}.</ref> However, the term ''televangelist'' was employed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine already in 1952, when telegenic Roman Catholic Bishop [[Fulton Sheen]] was referred to as the \"first televangelist\".<ref>\"Bishop Fulton Sheen: The First 'Televangelist'\", ''Time Magazine'', Monday, April 14, 1952</ref>\n\n==National Religious Broadcasters==\nAn association of American [[Evangelical Protestant]] religious broadcasters, the [[National Religious Broadcasters]], was founded in 1944.\n\n== History ==\n===Radio (1920s-onwards)===\n[[Image:S Parkes Cadman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[S. Parkes Cadman]], one of the first ministers to use radio, beginning in 1923]]\nChristianity has always emphasized [[Good News (Christianity)|preaching the gospel]] to the whole world, taking as inspiration the [[Great Commission]]. Historically, this was achieved by sending [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]], beginning with the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]], and later, after the invention of the [[printing press]], included the distribution of [[Bibles]] and [[religious tracts]]. Some Christians realized that the rapid uptake of [[radio]] beginning in the 1920s provided a powerful new tool for this task, and they were amongst the first producers of [[radio programming]]. Radio broadcasts were seen as a complementary activity to traditional missionaries, enabling vast numbers to be reached at relatively low cost, but also enabling Christianity to be preached in countries where this was illegal and missionaries were banned. The aim of Christian radio was to both convert people to Christianity and to provide teaching and support to believers. These activities continue today, particularly in the developing world. [[Shortwave]] radio stations with a Christian format broadcast worldwide, such as [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], [[Family Radio]]'s [[WYFR]], and the [[Bible Broadcasting Network|Bible Broadcasting Network (BBN)]], among others.\n\nIn the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a resurgence of [[revival meeting|revival-tent]] [[preacher|preaching]] in the [[Midwest]] and [[U.S. Southern states|South]], as itinerant traveling preachers drove from town to town, living off [[donation]]s. Several preachers began radio shows as a result of their popularity. One of the first ministers to use radio extensively was [[S. Parkes Cadman]], beginning in 1923.<ref>{{cite news|title=S.

For example, preacher [[John F. MacArthur|John MacArthur]] published a number of articles in December 2009 that were highly critical of some televangelists.\n\n{{quote|text=Someone needs to say this plainly: The faith healers and health-and-wealth preachers who dominate religious television are shameless frauds. Their message is not the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is nothing spiritual or miraculous about their on-stage chicanery. It is all a devious ruse designed to take advantage of desperate people. They are not Godly ministers but greedy impostors who corrupt the Word of God for money's sake. They are not real pastors who shepherd the flock of God but hirelings whose only design is to fleece the sheep. Their love of money is glaringly obvious in what they say as well as how they live. They claim to possess great spiritual power, but in reality they are rank materialists and enemies of everything holy.|sign=[[John F.

September 23, 1994. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812112353/http://www.trinityfi.org/investigations/roots_corruption.html |date=August 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nA proportion of their methods and theology are held by some to be conflicting with Christian doctrine taught in long existing traditionalist congregations. Many televangelists are featured by \"discernment ministries\" run by other Christians that are concerned about what they perceive as departures from sound Christian doctrine.\n\n* Many televangelists exist outside the structures of Christian denominations, meaning that they are not accountable to anyone.\n* The financial practices of many televangelists are unclear. A 2003 survey by the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' indicated that only one out of the 17 televangelists researched were members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523062020/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |archivedate=2010-05-23 }}</ref>\n* The [[prosperity gospel]] taught by many televangelists promises material, financial, physical, and spiritual success to believers, which can run counter to several aspects of Christian teaching that warn of suffering for following Christ and recommend surrendering one's material possessions ''(see: [[Jesus and the rich young man]])''.\n* Some televangelists have significant personal wealth and own large properties, luxury cars, and various transportation vehicles such as private aircraft or ministry aircraft. This is seen by critics to be contradictory to traditional Christian thinking.<ref>See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530052353/http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |archivedate=2010-05-30 }}</ref>\n* Televangelism requires substantial amounts of money to produce programs and purchase airtime on cable and satellite networks. Televangelists devote time to fundraising activities. Products such as books, CDs, DVDs, and trinkets are promoted to viewers.\n* Televangelists claim to be reaching millions of people worldwide with the gospel and producing numerous converts to [[Christianity]]. However, such claims are difficult to verify independently and are often disputed.<ref>Calvin L Smith wrote at http://www.calvinlsmith.com/2010/05/televangelism.html, \"Thus, despite a clear market demand for religious broadcasting... the evidence is that, ironically, the medium actually wins very few converts and is completely ineffective as an evangelistic tool. Instead religious broadcasting is primarily aimed at and viewed by Christians...\"</ref>\n* Several televangelists are very active in the national or international political arena (e.g., [[Pat Robertson]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Jimmy Swaggart]], [[John Hagee]]), and often espouse [[conservative]] politics on their programs. Such televangelists may occasionally arouse controversy by making remarks deemed offensive on their programs or elsewhere, or by endorsing partisan political candidates on donor-paid airtime, which runs afoul of the [[Johnson Amendment]]'s ban on [[501(c)(3) organization|tax-exempt organizations]] supporting or opposing candidates for political office.\n\nTelevangelists often strongly dispute these criticisms and say they are doing God's work. They cite declining attendance at traditional church services and the growth of global mass media as factors necessitating the use of television to \"fulfill the '[[Great Commission]]' of the Gospel of Jesus to the generation of the 21st Century.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Moral Majority Rhetoric ==\n{{Importance section|date=April 2020}}\nThe rhetoric of Jerry Fallwell was called the Moral Majority. This [[Rhetoric|rhetoric]] was male centered. It was meant to powerfully reaffirm those on the Christian right, and anger outsiders. It was aimed at evangelical Christians specifically.<ref>Wilcox, C. (1988). Sources of Support for the Old Right: A Comparison of the John Birch Society and the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade. Social Science History, 12(4), 429-449. doi:10.2307/1171382</ref> Although it was not as hypermasculine or militant as rhetoric that would come later, it still had some of those aspects. Its goal was to solidify evangelical Christians to a specific subset of their beliefs, and make them more fundamental. It was also rhetoric designed to convert fundamentalist Christians, previously unpolitical, into active conservatives. The message was aimed more at men but it was meant to have an effect on women as well.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Harding|first=Susan|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv301gc8|title=The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics|date=2018-06-26|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-19046-4|doi=10.2307/j.ctv301gc8.11}}</ref> Pat Robertson also used Moral Majority rhetoric in his televangelism.

However, the increasing globalisation of broadcasting has enabled some American televangelists to reach a wider audience through international broadcast networks, including some that are specifically Christian in nature, such as [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and [[The God Channel]]. Domestically produced televangelism is increasingly present in some other nations such as [[Brazil]].\n\nSome countries have a more regulated media with either general restrictions on access or specific rules regarding religious broadcasting. In such countries, religious programming is typically produced by TV companies (sometimes as a regulatory or public service requirement) rather than private [[interest group]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word ''televangelism'' is a [[portmanteau]] of [[television]] and [[evangelism]] and it was coined in 1958 as the title of a television miniseries by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].<ref name=Stewart>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Tim|title=televangelism|url=http://www.dictionaryofchristianese.com/televangelism/|website=Dictionary of Christianese|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref> [[Jeffrey K.

Parkes Cadman]], one of the first ministers to use radio, beginning in 1923]]\nChristianity has always emphasized [[Good News (Christianity)|preaching the gospel]] to the whole world, taking as inspiration the [[Great Commission]]. Historically, this was achieved by sending [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]], beginning with the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]], and later, after the invention of the [[printing press]], included the distribution of [[Bibles]] and [[religious tracts]]. Some Christians realized that the rapid uptake of [[radio]] beginning in the 1920s provided a powerful new tool for this task, and they were amongst the first producers of [[radio programming]]. Radio broadcasts were seen as a complementary activity to traditional missionaries, enabling vast numbers to be reached at relatively low cost, but also enabling Christianity to be preached in countries where this was illegal and missionaries were banned. The aim of Christian radio was to both convert people to Christianity and to provide teaching and support to believers. These activities continue today, particularly in the developing world. [[Shortwave]] radio stations with a Christian format broadcast worldwide, such as [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], [[Family Radio]]'s [[WYFR]], and the [[Bible Broadcasting Network|Bible Broadcasting Network (BBN)]], among others.\n\nIn the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a resurgence of [[revival meeting|revival-tent]] [[preacher|preaching]] in the [[Midwest]] and [[U.S. Southern states|South]], as itinerant traveling preachers drove from town to town, living off [[donation]]s. Several preachers began radio shows as a result of their popularity. One of the first ministers to use radio extensively was [[S. Parkes Cadman]], beginning in 1923.<ref>{{cite news|title=S.

For example, preacher [[John F. MacArthur|John MacArthur]] published a number of articles in December 2009 that were highly critical of some televangelists.\n\n{{quote|text=Someone needs to say this plainly: The faith healers and health-and-wealth preachers who dominate religious television are shameless frauds. Their message is not the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is nothing spiritual or miraculous about their on-stage chicanery. It is all a devious ruse designed to take advantage of desperate people. They are not Godly ministers but greedy impostors who corrupt the Word of God for money's sake. They are not real pastors who shepherd the flock of God but hirelings whose only design is to fleece the sheep. Their love of money is glaringly obvious in what they say as well as how they live. They claim to possess great spiritual power, but in reality they are rank materialists and enemies of everything holy.|sign=[[John F. MacArthur|John MacArthur]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/Blog/B091207|title=A Colossal Fraud|website=Grace to You}}</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly, [[Ole Anthony]] wrote very critically of televangelists in 1994.<ref>[http://www.trinityfi.org/investigations/roots_corruption.html Corruption in Televangelism and Paganism in the American Church]. September 23, 1994. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812112353/http://www.trinityfi.org/investigations/roots_corruption.html |date=August 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nA proportion of their methods and theology are held by some to be conflicting with Christian doctrine taught in long existing traditionalist congregations. Many televangelists are featured by \"discernment ministries\" run by other Christians that are concerned about what they perceive as departures from sound Christian doctrine.\n\n* Many televangelists exist outside the structures of Christian denominations, meaning that they are not accountable to anyone.\n* The financial practices of many televangelists are unclear. A 2003 survey by the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' indicated that only one out of the 17 televangelists researched were members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523062020/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |archivedate=2010-05-23 }}</ref>\n* The [[prosperity gospel]] taught by many televangelists promises material, financial, physical, and spiritual success to believers, which can run counter to several aspects of Christian teaching that warn of suffering for following Christ and recommend surrendering one's material possessions ''(see: [[Jesus and the rich young man]])''.\n* Some televangelists have significant personal wealth and own large properties, luxury cars, and various transportation vehicles such as private aircraft or ministry aircraft. This is seen by critics to be contradictory to traditional Christian thinking.<ref>See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530052353/http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |archivedate=2010-05-30 }}</ref>\n* Televangelism requires substantial amounts of money to produce programs and purchase airtime on cable and satellite networks. Televangelists devote time to fundraising activities. Products such as books, CDs, DVDs, and trinkets are promoted to viewers.\n* Televangelists claim to be reaching millions of people worldwide with the gospel and producing numerous converts to [[Christianity]]. However, such claims are difficult to verify independently and are often disputed.<ref>Calvin L Smith wrote at http://www.calvinlsmith.com/2010/05/televangelism.html, \"Thus, despite a clear market demand for religious broadcasting... the evidence is that, ironically, the medium actually wins very few converts and is completely ineffective as an evangelistic tool. Instead religious broadcasting is primarily aimed at and viewed by Christians...\"</ref>\n* Several televangelists are very active in the national or international political arena (e.g., [[Pat Robertson]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Jimmy Swaggart]], [[John Hagee]]), and often espouse [[conservative]] politics on their programs. Such televangelists may occasionally arouse controversy by making remarks deemed offensive on their programs or elsewhere, or by endorsing partisan political candidates on donor-paid airtime, which runs afoul of the [[Johnson Amendment]]'s ban on [[501(c)(3) organization|tax-exempt organizations]] supporting or opposing candidates for political office.\n\nTelevangelists often strongly dispute these criticisms and say they are doing God's work. They cite declining attendance at traditional church services and the growth of global mass media as factors necessitating the use of television to \"fulfill the '[[Great Commission]]' of the Gospel of Jesus to the generation of the 21st Century.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Moral Majority Rhetoric ==\n{{Importance section|date=April 2020}}\nThe rhetoric of Jerry Fallwell was called the Moral Majority.

Social Science History, 12(4), 429-449. doi:10.2307/1171382</ref> Although it was not as hypermasculine or militant as rhetoric that would come later, it still had some of those aspects. Its goal was to solidify evangelical Christians to a specific subset of their beliefs, and make them more fundamental. It was also rhetoric designed to convert fundamentalist Christians, previously unpolitical, into active conservatives. The message was aimed more at men but it was meant to have an effect on women as well.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Harding|first=Susan|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv301gc8|title=The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics|date=2018-06-26|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-19046-4|doi=10.2307/j.ctv301gc8.11}}</ref> Pat Robertson also used Moral Majority rhetoric in his televangelism.
