On Eddy's recommendation, Jeremiah S. Beebe then hired Cornell to repair and overhaul his plaster and flour mills on Fall Creek. During Cornell's long association with Beebe, he designed and built a tunnel for a new mill race on Fall Creek; a stone dam on Fall Creek, which formed Beebe Lake; and a new flour mill. By 1832, he was in charge of all Beebe's concerns at Fall Creek.\n\nEzra Cornell was a [[Quakers#Membership|birthright]] [[Quakers|Quaker]], but was later disowned by the Society of Friends for marrying outside of the faith to a \u201cworld\u2019s woman,\u201d Mary Ann Wood, a [[Methodism|Methodist]].

So, having purchased rights in a patent for a new type of plow, Cornell began what would be decades of traveling away from Ithaca. His territories for sales of the plow were the states of [[Maine]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. His plan was to sell in Maine in the summer and the milder Georgia in the winter.

[[Andrew Dickson White]] helped secure the new institution's status as New York's [[land grant university]], and [[Cornell University]] was granted a charter through their efforts in 1865.\n\nLands granted by the Morrill Act to universities in states without substantial federal land could be claimed in states having a large surplus of unclaimed land. Cornell University's endowment was based on Ezra Cornell's judicious investment in federal land, especially timber land in [[Wisconsin]]. Unlike most land grant universities, which sold their land immediately, under Ezra's leadership Cornell managed and maintained its land for an extended period, selling it only at the most opportune time. The university was able to reap an unprecedented $5 million endowment as a result.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Paul Wallace |authorlink=Paul Wallace Gates |title=The Wisconsin Pine Lands of Cornell University |year=2011 |publisher=Fall Creek Books |location=Ithaca and London |isbn=978-0-8014-7763-8 |page= |oclc=753307278 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Llenroc.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Llenroc, home of Ezra Cornell]]\n\n==Later life==\n[[Image:Ezra Cornell Sarcophagus.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Cornell's sarcophagus in [[Sage Chapel]]]]\nEzra Cornell entered the railroad business, but fared poorly due to the [[Panic of 1873]].<ref>http://toursixmilecreek.org/NTrestle.php</ref> He began construction of a palatial Ithaca mansion, [[Llenroc]] (Cornell spelled in reverse) to replace his farmhouse, Forest Home, but died before it was completed.

[[Andrew Dickson White]] helped secure the new institution's status as New York's [[land grant university]], and [[Cornell University]] was granted a charter through their efforts in 1865.\n\nLands granted by the Morrill Act to universities in states without substantial federal land could be claimed in states having a large surplus of unclaimed land. Cornell University's endowment was based on Ezra Cornell's judicious investment in federal land, especially timber land in [[Wisconsin]]. Unlike most land grant universities, which sold their land immediately, under Ezra's leadership Cornell managed and maintained its land for an extended period, selling it only at the most opportune time. The university was able to reap an unprecedented $5 million endowment as a result.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Paul Wallace |authorlink=Paul Wallace Gates |title=The Wisconsin Pine Lands of Cornell University |year=2011 |publisher=Fall Creek Books |location=Ithaca and London |isbn=978-0-8014-7763-8 |page= |oclc=753307278 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Llenroc.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Llenroc, home of Ezra Cornell]]\n\n==Later life==\n[[Image:Ezra Cornell Sarcophagus.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Cornell's sarcophagus in [[Sage Chapel]]]]\nEzra Cornell entered the railroad business, but fared poorly due to the [[Panic of 1873]].<ref>http://toursixmilecreek.org/NTrestle.php</ref> He began construction of a palatial Ithaca mansion, [[Llenroc]] (Cornell spelled in reverse) to replace his farmhouse, Forest Home, but died before it was completed.

Cornell was originally laid to rest in [[Lake View Cemetery (Ithaca, New York)|Lake View Cemetery]], Ithaca N.Y., then moved to Sage Chapel.\n\nA prolific letter writer, Ezra corresponded with a great many people and would write dozens of letters each week.

{"title_page": "List of leaders of the Soviet Union", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Soviet Union sidebar}}\nDuring [[History of the Soviet Union| its sixty-nine-year history]], the [[Soviet Union]] usually had a ''[[de facto]]'' leader who would not necessarily be [[head of state]], but would lead while holding an office such as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] or [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]]. Under the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|1977 Constitution]], the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]], or Premier, was the [[head of government]]{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=169}} and the [[First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] was the [[head of state]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=165}} The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a [[prime minister]] in the [[First World]]{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=169}} whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a [[president (government title)|president]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=165}} In the [[Leninism|ideology]] of [[Vladimir Lenin]], the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the [[vanguard party]] (see ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'').\n\nFollowing [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|consolidation of power]] in the 1920s,{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=98}} the post of the General Secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] became synonymous with leader of the Soviet Union{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=93}} because the post controlled both the Communist Party and the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]]{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=98}} both indirectly via party membership and via the tradition of a single person holding two highest posts in the party and in the government. The post of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] under the name of First Secretary. In 1966, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]],{{sfn|Ginsburgs|Ajani|van den Berg|1989|p=500}} the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990.{{sfn|Armstrong|1989|p=22}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader the successor usually needed the support of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The [[President of the Soviet Union]], an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=195}}\n\nContemporaneously to establishment of the office of the President, representatives of the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] voted to remove [[Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution|Article 6]] from the [[Soviet Constitution]] which stated that the Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] controlled by the Communist Party which in turn played the leading role in society.

The actual leader of the triumvirate was Zinoviev, but he began to disagree with Stalin after the victory over Trotsky. Stalin continued to increase his influence in the party, and by the end of the 1920s he became the sole dictator of the USSR, defeating all his political opponents. The post of General Secretary of the party, which was held by Stalin, became the most important post in the Soviet hierarchy.\n\nStalin's early policies pushed for rapid [[industrialisation]], [[nationalisation]] of private industry{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=62}} and the [[collectivisation]] of private plots created under Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=63}} As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the [[Great Purge]], a series of campaigns of political murder, repression and persecution.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=72}} [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] troops [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941,{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=90}} but by December the [[Soviet Army]] managed to stop the attack just shy of Moscow. On Stalin's orders, the Soviet Union launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany which finally succeeded in 1945.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=148}} Stalin died in March 1953{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=194}} and his death triggered a power struggle in which [[Nikita Khrushchev]] after several years emerged victorious against [[Georgy Malenkov]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp= 231\u201333}}\n\nKhrushchev denounced Stalin on two occasions, first in 1956 and then in 1962. His policy of [[de-Stalinisation]] earned him many enemies within the party, especially from old [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] appointees. Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising. A group known as [[Anti-Party Group]] tried to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957, but it failed.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=246}} As Khrushchev grew older, his erratic behavior became worse, usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo.{{sfn|Service|2009|p=378}} [[Leonid Brezhnev]], a close companion of Khrushchev, was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev's removal from power. [[Alexei Kosygin]] became the new Premier and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] kept his office as Chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]]. On the orders of the Politburo, Mikoyan was forced to retire in 1965 and [[Nikolai Podgorny]] took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p= 402}} The Soviet Union in the post-Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a [[collective leadership]].{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=13}} [[Henry A.

In 1983, Andropov was hospitalised and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health. [[Nikolai Tikhonov]] usually chaired the meetings in his place.{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=146}} Following Andropov's death fifteen months after his appointment, an even older leader, 72 year old [[Konstantin Chernenko]], was elected to the General Secretariat. His rule lasted for little more than a year until his death thirteen months later on 10 March 1985.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=481}}\n\nAt the age of 54, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the General Secretariat by the Politburo on 11 March 1985.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=487}} In May 1985, Gorbachev publicly admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequate living standards, being the first Soviet leader to do so while also beginning a series of fundamental reforms. From 1986 to around 1988, he was advertised in a Pizza Hut advertisement, dismantled [[central planning]], allowed state enterprises to set their own outputs, enabled private investment in businesses not previously permitted to be privately owned and allowed foreign investment, among other measures. He also opened up the management of and decision-making within the Soviet Union and allowed greater public discussion and criticism, along with a warming of relationships with the West. These twin policies were known as ''[[perestroika]]'' (literally meaning \"reconstruction\", though it varies) and ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\" and \"transparency\"), respectively.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=489}} The dismantling of the principal defining features of [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communism]] in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union led to the unintended consequence of the [[Breakup of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union breaking up]] after the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 coup]] led by [[Gennady Yanayev]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=503}}\n\n== List of leaders ==\nThe following list includes persons who held the top leadership position of the Soviet Union from its [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|founding]] in 1922 until its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|1991 dissolution]].

Under the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|1977 Constitution]], the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]], or Premier, was the [[head of government]]{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=169}} and the [[First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] was the [[head of state]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=165}} The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a [[prime minister]] in the [[First World]]{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=169}} whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a [[president (government title)|president]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=165}} In the [[Leninism|ideology]] of [[Vladimir Lenin]], the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the [[vanguard party]] (see ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'').\n\nFollowing [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|consolidation of power]] in the 1920s,{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=98}} the post of the General Secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] became synonymous with leader of the Soviet Union{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=93}} because the post controlled both the Communist Party and the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]]{{sfn|Armstrong|1986|p=98}} both indirectly via party membership and via the tradition of a single person holding two highest posts in the party and in the government. The post of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] under the name of First Secretary. In 1966, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]],{{sfn|Ginsburgs|Ajani|van den Berg|1989|p=500}} the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990.{{sfn|Armstrong|1989|p=22}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader the successor usually needed the support of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The [[President of the Soviet Union]], an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=195}}\n\nContemporaneously to establishment of the office of the President, representatives of the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] voted to remove [[Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution|Article 6]] from the [[Soviet Constitution]] which stated that the Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] controlled by the Communist Party which in turn played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and [[Soviet people|its people]].{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=196}} Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the [[Vice President of the Soviet Union]] would assume the office, though the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] before this was actually tested.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=275}} After the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 coup]], the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the [[State Council of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"pravojustice\">{{Cite web|last=Gorbachev |first=M. |authorlink=Mikhail Gorbachev |script-title=ru:\u0417\u0410\u041a\u041e\u041d \u041e\u0431 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 \u0421\u0421\u0420 \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434 |trans-title=Law Regarding State Governing Bodies of the USSR in Transition  |url=http://www.sssr.su/zopp.html |date=5 September 1991 |publisher=Union of Soviet Socialist Republics |language=Russian |accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] was voted the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars|Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union]] (Sovnarkom) on 30 December 1922 by the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]].{{sfn|Lenin|1920|p=516}} At the age of 53, his health declined from effects of two bullet wounds, later aggravated by three [[stroke]]s which culminated with his death in 1924.{{sfn|Clark|1988|p=373}} Irrespective of his health status in his final days, Lenin was already losing much of his power to [[Joseph Stalin]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=59}} [[Alexei Rykov]] succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom and although he was ''[[de jure]]'' the most powerful person in the country, but in fact all power was concentrated in the hands of the \"troika\" - the union of three influential party figures: Grigory Zinoviev, Joseph Stalin and Lev Kamenev. The actual leader of the triumvirate was Zinoviev, but he began to disagree with Stalin after the victory over Trotsky. Stalin continued to increase his influence in the party, and by the end of the 1920s he became the sole dictator of the USSR, defeating all his political opponents. The post of General Secretary of the party, which was held by Stalin, became the most important post in the Soviet hierarchy.\n\nStalin's early policies pushed for rapid [[industrialisation]], [[nationalisation]] of private industry{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=62}} and the [[collectivisation]] of private plots created under Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=63}} As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the [[Great Purge]], a series of campaigns of political murder, repression and persecution.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=72}} [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] troops [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941,{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=90}} but by December the [[Soviet Army]] managed to stop the attack just shy of Moscow. On Stalin's orders, the Soviet Union launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany which finally succeeded in 1945.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=148}} Stalin died in March 1953{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=194}} and his death triggered a power struggle in which [[Nikita Khrushchev]] after several years emerged victorious against [[Georgy Malenkov]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp= 231\u201333}}\n\nKhrushchev denounced Stalin on two occasions, first in 1956 and then in 1962. His policy of [[de-Stalinisation]] earned him many enemies within the party, especially from old [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] appointees. Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising. A group known as [[Anti-Party Group]] tried to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957, but it failed.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=246}} As Khrushchev grew older, his erratic behavior became worse, usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo.{{sfn|Service|2009|p=378}} [[Leonid Brezhnev]], a close companion of Khrushchev, was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev's removal from power. [[Alexei Kosygin]] became the new Premier and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] kept his office as Chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]]. On the orders of the Politburo, Mikoyan was forced to retire in 1965 and [[Nikolai Podgorny]] took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p= 402}} The Soviet Union in the post-Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a [[collective leadership]].{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=13}} [[Henry A. Kissinger]], the American [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], mistakenly believed that Kosygin was the leader of the Soviet Union and that he was at the helm of Soviet foreign policy because he represented the Soviet Union at the 1967 [[Glassboro Summit Conference]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=403}} The \"[[Brezhnev stagnation|Era of Stagnation]]\", a derogatory term coined by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], was a period marked by low socio-economic efficiency in the country and a [[gerontocracy]] ruling the country.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=398}} [[Yuri Andropov]] (aged 68 at the time) succeeded Brezhnev in his post as General Secretary in 1982. In 1983, Andropov was hospitalised and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health. [[Nikolai Tikhonov]] usually chaired the meetings in his place.{{sfn|Zemtsov|1989|p=146}} Following Andropov's death fifteen months after his appointment, an even older leader, 72 year old [[Konstantin Chernenko]], was elected to the General Secretariat. His rule lasted for little more than a year until his death thirteen months later on 10 March 1985.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=481}}\n\nAt the age of 54, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the General Secretariat by the Politburo on 11 March 1985.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=487}} In May 1985, Gorbachev publicly admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequate living standards, being the first Soviet leader to do so while also beginning a series of fundamental reforms. From 1986 to around 1988, he was advertised in a Pizza Hut advertisement, dismantled [[central planning]], allowed state enterprises to set their own outputs, enabled private investment in businesses not previously permitted to be privately owned and allowed foreign investment, among other measures. He also opened up the management of and decision-making within the Soviet Union and allowed greater public discussion and criticism, along with a warming of relationships with the West. These twin policies were known as ''[[perestroika]]'' (literally meaning \"reconstruction\", though it varies) and ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\" and \"transparency\"), respectively.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=489}} The dismantling of the principal defining features of [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communism]] in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union led to the unintended consequence of the [[Breakup of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union breaking up]] after the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 coup]] led by [[Gennady Yanayev]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=503}}\n\n== List of leaders ==\nThe following list includes persons who held the top leadership position of the Soviet Union from its [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|founding]] in 1922 until its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|1991 dissolution]].

The variety of materials from which a clock may be constructed and the complexity of [[clockwork]] warrant such care to be taken by a clock owner so that a clock can continue to function.\n\n== Preventive conservation ==\nProper handling, suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance can together prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock's sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock.\n\n=== Horological Conservation History ===\n[[File:L Ancient-egyptian-sundial.jpg|thumb|World's oldest Sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC).

Horology: A Brief History. Retrieved from: https://www.artsandcollections.com/article/horology-a-brief-history</ref>.\u201d Some examples of instruments used to measure time include: clocks, watches, sundials, hourglasses, time recorders, and atomic clocks.

A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.\n\n=== Proper Storage and display ===\n[[File:Tall Clock MET 192934.jpg|thumb|19th c.

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=https://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements.<ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:00, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Correct Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Running Clocks vs. Static Display ====\n\nClocks can be simple display objects if they are not required to run. This reduces the physical force on the clock. Whereas \u201crunning any functional object will result in wear and handling, which contributes to the degradation of the parts\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/> Running clocks also require winding, which adds to the wear-and-tear of the gears and leads to more handling of the object. <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\n=== Regular Clock Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= https://cool.culturalheritage.org/byauth/moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract.

Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.\n\n=== Proper Storage and display ===\n[[File:Tall Clock MET 192934.jpg|thumb|19th c.

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=https://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements.<ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:00, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Correct Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Running Clocks vs. Static Display ====\n\nClocks can be simple display objects if they are not required to run. This reduces the physical force on the clock. Whereas \u201crunning any functional object will result in wear and handling, which contributes to the degradation of the parts\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/> Running clocks also require winding, which adds to the wear-and-tear of the gears and leads to more handling of the object. Over-winding can break the delicate mechanisms. <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\n=== Regular Clock Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= https://cool.culturalheritage.org/byauth/moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.

Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey\u2019s Pagoda Clock|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Hr:Konzervacija satova]]\n", "name_user": "LEHarrison", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRunning Clocks vs. Static Display", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_clocks"}

The show debuted on October 5, 2000, on [[The WB]] and became a flagship series for the network. ''Gilmore Girls'' originally ran for seven seasons, the final season moving to [[The CW]] and ending its run on May 15, 2007.\n\nThe show's main focus is on the relationship between single mother, [[Lorelai Gilmore]], and her daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], who live in [[Stars Hollow]], [[Connecticut]], a small fictional town filled with colorful characters. The series explores issues of family, romance, education, friendship, disappointment, and ambition, along with generational divides and social class, the latter themes manifesting through Lorelai's difficult relationship with her [[High society (social class)|high society]] parents, [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]], and Rory's experiences at the elite, private high school Chilton and later on at [[Yale University]].\nSherman-Palladino, who served as [[showrunner]] for the majority of the series, infused ''Gilmore Girls'' with distinctive fast-paced dialogue filled with [[pop culture]] references. After season six, when the series moved to its new network, Sherman-Palladino left the show and was replaced by [[David S. Rosenthal]] for the final season. The series was produced and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and filmed on the studio's lot in [[Burbank, California]].\n\nTelevision critics praised ''Gilmore Girls'' for its witty dialogue, cross-generational appeal, and effective mix of humor and drama. It never drew large ratings but was a relative success for The WB, peaking during season five as the network's second most-popular show. The series has been in daily [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] since 2004, while a growing and dedicated [[fandom]] has led to its status as a cult classic. Since coming off the air, ''Gilmore Girls'' has been cited in ''[[TV (The Book)]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=tvbook/><ref name=\"The Making of The Gilmore Girls\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659192_1652529,00.html |title=All-TIME 100 TV Shows |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> In 2016, the main cast and Sherman-Palladino returned for a four-part [[miniseries]] revival titled ''[[Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life]]'', which streamed on [[Netflix]].\n\n== Premise ==\n\nThe series has two protagonists: witty \"thirty-something\" mother [[Lorelai Gilmore]] and her intellectual teenage daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] (short for Lorelai). Their backstory is established early in the show: Lorelai grew up in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] with her [[old money]] parents, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Emily Gilmore|Emily]], but always felt stifled in this environment. After Lorelai and her childhood friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Christopher Hayden]] became pregnant with Rory at 16, Lorelai's feelings of familial alienation only increased. This eventually motivated her to take one-year-old Rory away to a close-knit town named [[Stars Hollow]]. Lorelai found work and shelter at the Independence Inn as a maid, eventually working her way up to executive manager. Over the years, Lorelai and Rory develop a very close relationship, living like best friends rather than as typical mother-daughter. Lorelai is proud of the independent life she has forged away from her parents. In the [[Pilot (Gilmore Girls)|pilot episode]], however, she is forced to go to them for financial aid after Rory is admitted to Chilton Preparatory School because she cannot afford the tuition fees. Emily and Richard agree to provide a loan, so long as the girls join them every Friday night for dinner. This sets up one of the show's primary, ongoing conflicts: the Gilmore family is forced to face their differences and complicated past. The contrasting mother-daughter relationships of Emily\u2013Lorelai and Lorelai\u2013Rory become a defining theme of the show and a lens through which many of the female relationships are viewed. Series creator [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] has summarized the core of ''Gilmore Girls'':\n\n{{quote|I think the theme was always family and connection. I always felt like the underlying thing about Gilmore was that, if you happened to be born into a family that doesn't really understand you, go out and make your own. That's what Lorelai did. She went out and she made her own family. The ironic twist in her life is that then this daughter that she created this half family for, likes the family that she left. It was a cycle of crazy family.<ref name=collider/>}}\n\nThe series also focuses on both girls' ambition: Rory to attend an [[Ivy League]] college and become a journalist, and Lorelai to open an inn with her best friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Sookie St. James|Sookie St. James]]. The romantic relationships of the protagonists are another key feature; throughout the series, Lorelai has a \"will-they-won't-they\" dynamic with her friend, local diner owner [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Luke Danes|Luke Danes]], while also harboring unresolved feelings for Rory's father, Christopher. Lorelai also develops temporary feelings for Rory's English literature teacher, Max Medina, and Jason \"Digger\" Stiles, who she has known since childhood. Rory's romantic journey throughout the show is based on the adolescent experiences of first-loves, flings, crushes, and college dates. While Rory has three committed boyfriends over the course of the show\u2014local new-kid [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Dean Forrester|Dean Forrester]]; mysterious, well-read bad boy [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Jess Mariano|Jess Mariano]]; and wealthy, charismatic [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Logan Huntzberger|Logan Huntzberger]]\u2014she also has brief, romantically charged relationships with men whose love is unrequited: fellow Chilton student [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Tristan Dugray]] and Rory's only \"guy-bestie\" at Yale, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Marty]].\n\nThe quirky townspeople of Stars Hollow are a constant presence. Along with series-long and season-long arcs, ''Gilmore Girls'' is also episodic in nature, with mini-plots within each episode \u2014 such as town festivals, issues at Lorelai's inn, or school projects of Rory's.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n{{:List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 1)}}\n\nRory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to match the demands of private school and attracting the fury of classmate [[Paris Geller]], her academic rival. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean, but the pair break up when Rory doesn't reciprocate his, \"I love you\". She is also pursued by arrogant Chilton student Tristan, but she has little interest in his advances. After being romantically pursued by Rory's teacher, Max Medina, Lorelai decides with a conflicted heart to give the relationship a chance. This dynamic creates some tension between Lorelai and Rory.  At the same time, Lorelai harbours a close friendship with the local diner owner, Luke Danes, and several people comment on their mutual attraction\u2014but Lorelai is in denial and Luke doesn't act on it. Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, returns and also wants to be with Lorelai but she tells him he is too immature for a family life. All the while, Lorelai struggles to adjust to having her parents in her life on a regular basis. Emily and Richard enjoy developing a relationship with their granddaughter, but also realize how much they have missed. The season ends with Rory reuniting with Dean, and Max proposing to Lorelai.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 2)}}\n\nLorelai accepts Max's proposal, but realises shortly before the wedding that it doesn't feel right and they break up. She and Sookie get excited about opening their own business at the dilapidated Dragonfly Inn but the owner refuses to sell. Sookie gets engaged to Jackson Belleville, a local farmer. Luke's teenage nephew, Jess Mariano, comes to live under his care. Jess is sullen and angry with everyone apart from Rory. The two strike up a friendship, causing jealousy in Dean. Lorelai is disapproving of their closeness, labeling Jess as a bad influence, especially when they are in a car accident which leads to a blow-up with Luke. Richard announces that he has retired but soon becomes bored and sets up his own insurance company. Christopher appears to have his life together and Lorelai decides to reunite with him. But at Sookie's wedding Christopher learns that his recently estranged fianc\u00e9e is pregnant and decides to return to her, leaving Lorelai heartbroken. Meanwhile, Rory impulsively kisses Jess.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 3)}}\n\nRory's attraction to Jess grows stronger, and she gets jealous when he teases her with a new girlfriend. Dean can't ignore what is going on, and eventually ends their relationship. Rory and Jess immediately become a couple. Meanwhile, she and Paris spend the year as Student Body Presidents at Chilton and both submit applications to [[Harvard University]]. Paris is devastated when she doesn't get in. Rory is accepted but decides to attend [[Yale University]] instead, much to Emily and Richard's delight. The Independence Inn is badly damaged in a fire, but Lorelai and Sookie are able to buy the Dragonfly when its elderly owner dies. Jess pressures Rory to have sex with him, which leads to a fight between Dean and Jess. Luke begins dating a lawyer named Nicole. Lane Kim, Rory's best friend, starts a band called Hep Alien and tries to convince her strict mother to let her date the guitarist, Dave, while keeping the band secret. As the season ends, Jess abruptly leaves Stars Hollow to track down his estranged father in California, and Rory graduates High School as [[valedictorian]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 4)}}\n\nRory starts her college education at Yale, with Paris \u2013 now a friend \u2013 as her roommate. Both start working for the [[Yale Daily News]]. Rory is surprised when Dean quickly marries his new girlfriend. The pair grow closer again over the season, leading Rory to turn down Jess when he returns and declares his love. Lorelai spends the season renovating the Dragonfly Inn in preparation for its opening, along with Sookie and their colleague Michel. She also begins a relationship with Richard's new business partner, Jason Stiles, which she keeps secret from her parents. Lane's mother learns about Hep Alien and throws her out of the house. Sookie and Jackson have a son. Lorelai and Jason break up after Jason sues Richard for leaving their partnership and Lorelai sides with her father. Emily feels neglected by Richard and the two separate, with Richard moving into the pool house. Luke and Nicole [[elope]] during a cruise, but quickly decide to divorce. Towards the end of the season, Luke accepts that he is in love with Lorelai and begins wooing her. The pair finally kiss on the Dragonfly's opening night, while Rory loses her virginity to a married Dean.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 5)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke start a relationship. Emily and Richard \u2013 who reunite and renew their wedding vows \u2013 disapprove and Emily interferes by telling Christopher to try to win her back. Luke feels overwhelmed, resulting in a brief separation between him and Lorelai and a rift between Lorelai and Emily. Rory tries to have another relationship with Dean, now separated from his wife after she found out about the affair, but it soon ends when he realizes how different their lives are. She falls for Logan Huntzberger, a wealthy playboy Yale student whose parents think she is beneath him. Lane and Paris both start relationships: the former with her bandmate Zack, the latter with Yale Daily News editor Doyle. Sookie has a daughter. Rory gets an internship at Logan's father's newspaper but is deflated when he tells her she \"doesn't have it.\" Rory lashes out due to this and she and Logan are arrested for stealing a yacht, after which Rory announces that she is quitting Yale and moves in with her grandparents at their pool house. When Lorelai sees how supportive Luke is over the situation, she asks him to marry her.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 6)}}\n\nLorelai is devastated by Rory's actions but insists that she can't force her back to Yale: it's a decision Rory must make for herself. Mother and daughter don't speak for six months. Rory has to complete [[community service]] and Emily gets her a job with the [[Daughters of the American Revolution|DAR]]. Richard becomes concerned but eventually, after encouragement from Jess, Rory returns to Yale and reunites with Lorelai. She replaces Paris as editor of the Yale Daily News, which causes issues in their friendship, and after a short separation from Logan the relationship gets serious. Rory is crushed when Logan's father sends him to work in London. Hep Alien disband then come back together; Lane and Zack get married. Lorelai plans a wedding with Luke, but things get difficult when Luke learns that he has a 12-year-old daughter named April. He starts building a relationship with her but keeps Lorelai separate. Lorelai tries to accept this but eventually snaps and issues him an ultimatum. When he doesn't agree to elope, Lorelai goes to Christopher for comfort.\n\n=== Season 7 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 7)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke officially split when she tells him she slept with Christopher. Before much time has passed, Christopher convinces Lorelai to try a relationship. The pair spontaneously marry during a trip in Paris, but Lorelai soon accepts that it isn't right and they split amicably. Luke has a custody battle over April, after her mother moves them to New Mexico, and wins the right to see her during holidays. Lane and Zack have twins, and Sookie becomes pregnant again. Rory completes her final year of college. She and Logan spend half the season in a long-distance relationship until he eventually moves back to New York. He proposes, but Rory says that she wants to keep her options open, which leads to their separation. She panics about what she will do after graduating; following some rejection, she gets a job reporting on the [[Barack Obama]] campaign trail. Stars Hollow throws a surprise goodbye party for Rory. When Lorelai finds out that Luke organized it, the pair reconcile with a kiss. Lorelai promises Emily that she will continue attending Friday Night Dinners. Before Lorelai and Rory have to say goodbye, they have one last breakfast at Luke's Diner.\n\n=== ''A Year in the Life'' ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life}}\n\nNine years after the end of the original series, Netflix produced a ''Gilmore Girls'' revival miniseries. Rory is struggling in her journalism career and having a no-strings-attached, secret affair with Logan in London, while technically having a boyfriend named Paul that she often forgets about. While Logan is engaged to be married the two of them can't seem to stay apart. Lorelai and Luke live together but are still having communication problems. Richard has recently died of a heart attack, which causes tension between Lorelai and Emily and they end up in joint therapy. Lorelai starts to question her life, so travels to California with intentions to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, where she has an epiphany: she fixes the rift with Emily by recounting a happy story about Richard, and goes home to propose to Luke.

In 2002, four [[young adult novel]]s were published that adapted scripts from the first and second seasons into novel form, told from Rory's [[first-person point of view]].

The show debuted on October 5, 2000, on [[The WB]] and became a flagship series for the network. ''Gilmore Girls'' originally ran for seven seasons, the final season moving to [[The CW]] and ending its run on May 15, 2007.\n\nThe show's main focus is on the relationship between single mother, [[Lorelai Gilmore]], and her daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], who live in [[Stars Hollow]], [[Connecticut]], a small fictional town filled with colorful characters. The series explores issues of family, romance, education, friendship, disappointment, and ambition, along with generational divides and social class, the latter themes manifesting through Lorelai's difficult relationship with her [[High society (social class)|high society]] parents, [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]] and [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]], and Rory's experiences at the elite, private high school Chilton and later on at [[Yale University]].\nSherman-Palladino, who served as [[showrunner]] for the majority of the series, infused ''Gilmore Girls'' with distinctive fast-paced dialogue filled with [[pop culture]] references. After season six, when the series moved to its new network, Sherman-Palladino left the show and was replaced by [[David S. Rosenthal]] for the final season. The series was produced and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and filmed on the studio's lot in [[Burbank, California]].\n\nTelevision critics praised ''Gilmore Girls'' for its witty dialogue, cross-generational appeal, and effective mix of humor and drama. It never drew large ratings but was a relative success for The WB, peaking during season five as the network's second most-popular show. The series has been in daily [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] since 2004, while a growing and dedicated [[fandom]] has led to its status as a cult classic. Since coming off the air, ''Gilmore Girls'' has been cited in ''[[TV (The Book)]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=tvbook/><ref name=\"The Making of The Gilmore Girls\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659192_1652529,00.html |title=All-TIME 100 TV Shows |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> In 2016, the main cast and Sherman-Palladino returned for a four-part [[miniseries]] revival titled ''[[Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life]]'', which streamed on [[Netflix]].\n\n== Premise ==\n\nThe series has two protagonists: witty \"thirty-something\" mother [[Lorelai Gilmore]] and her intellectual teenage daughter [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]] (short for Lorelai). Their backstory is established early in the show: Lorelai grew up in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] with her [[old money]] parents, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Emily Gilmore|Emily]], but always felt stifled in this environment. After Lorelai and her childhood friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Christopher Hayden]] became pregnant with Rory at 16, Lorelai's feelings of familial alienation only increased. This eventually motivated her to take one-year-old Rory away to a close-knit town named [[Stars Hollow]]. Lorelai found work and shelter at the Independence Inn as a maid, eventually working her way up to executive manager. Over the years, Lorelai and Rory develop a very close relationship, living like best friends rather than as typical mother-daughter. Lorelai is proud of the independent life she has forged away from her parents. In the [[Pilot (Gilmore Girls)|pilot episode]], however, she is forced to go to them for financial aid after Rory is admitted to Chilton Preparatory School because she cannot afford the tuition fees. Emily and Richard agree to provide a loan, so long as the girls join them every Friday night for dinner. This sets up one of the show's primary, ongoing conflicts: the Gilmore family is forced to face their differences and complicated past. The contrasting mother-daughter relationships of Emily\u2013Lorelai and Lorelai\u2013Rory become a defining theme of the show and a lens through which many of the female relationships are viewed. Series creator [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] has summarized the core of ''Gilmore Girls'':\n\n{{quote|I think the theme was always family and connection. I always felt like the underlying thing about Gilmore was that, if you happened to be born into a family that doesn't really understand you, go out and make your own. That's what Lorelai did. She went out and she made her own family. The ironic twist in her life is that then this daughter that she created this half family for, likes the family that she left. It was a cycle of crazy family.<ref name=collider/>}}\n\nThe series also focuses on both girls' ambition: Rory to attend an [[Ivy League]] college and become a journalist, and Lorelai to open an inn with her best friend [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Sookie St. James|Sookie St. James]]. The romantic relationships of the protagonists are another key feature; throughout the series, Lorelai has a \"will-they-won't-they\" dynamic with her friend, local diner owner [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Luke Danes|Luke Danes]], while also harboring unresolved feelings for Rory's father, Christopher. Lorelai also develops temporary feelings for Rory's English literature teacher, Max Medina, and Jason \"Digger\" Stiles, who she has known since childhood. Rory's romantic journey throughout the show is based on the adolescent experiences of first-loves, flings, crushes, and college dates. While Rory has three committed boyfriends over the course of the show\u2014local new-kid [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Dean Forrester|Dean Forrester]]; mysterious, well-read bad boy [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Jess Mariano|Jess Mariano]]; and wealthy, charismatic [[List of Gilmore Girls characters#Logan Huntzberger|Logan Huntzberger]]\u2014she also has brief, romantically charged relationships with men whose love is unrequited: fellow Chilton student [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Tristan Dugray]] and Rory's only \"guy-bestie\" at Yale, [[List of Gilmore Girls characters|Marty]].\n\nThe quirky townspeople of Stars Hollow are a constant presence. Along with series-long and season-long arcs, ''Gilmore Girls'' is also episodic in nature, with mini-plots within each episode \u2014 such as town festivals, issues at Lorelai's inn, or school projects of Rory's.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n{{:List of Gilmore Girls episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 1)}}\n\nRory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to match the demands of private school and attracting the fury of classmate [[Paris Geller]], her academic rival. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean, but the pair break up when Rory doesn't reciprocate his, \"I love you\". She is also pursued by arrogant Chilton student Tristan, but she has little interest in his advances. After being romantically pursued by Rory's teacher, Max Medina, Lorelai decides with a conflicted heart to give the relationship a chance. This dynamic creates some tension between Lorelai and Rory.  At the same time, Lorelai harbours a close friendship with the local diner owner, Luke Danes, and several people comment on their mutual attraction\u2014but Lorelai is in denial and Luke doesn't act on it. Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, returns and also wants to be with Lorelai but she tells him he is too immature for a family life. All the while, Lorelai struggles to adjust to having her parents in her life on a regular basis. Emily and Richard enjoy developing a relationship with their granddaughter, but also realize how much they have missed. The season ends with Rory reuniting with Dean, and Max proposing to Lorelai.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 2)}}\n\nLorelai accepts Max's proposal, but realises shortly before the wedding that it doesn't feel right and they break up. She and Sookie get excited about opening their own business at the dilapidated Dragonfly Inn but the owner refuses to sell. Sookie gets engaged to Jackson Belleville, a local farmer. Luke's teenage nephew, Jess Mariano, comes to live under his care. Jess is sullen and angry with everyone apart from Rory. The two strike up a friendship, causing jealousy in Dean. Lorelai is disapproving of their closeness, labeling Jess as a bad influence, especially when they are in a car accident which leads to a blow-up with Luke. Richard announces that he has retired but soon becomes bored and sets up his own insurance company. Christopher appears to have his life together and Lorelai decides to reunite with him. But at Sookie's wedding Christopher learns that his recently estranged fianc\u00e9e is pregnant and decides to return to her, leaving Lorelai heartbroken. Meanwhile, Rory impulsively kisses Jess.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 3)}}\n\nRory's attraction to Jess grows stronger, and she gets jealous when he teases her with a new girlfriend. Dean can't ignore what is going on, and eventually ends their relationship. Rory and Jess immediately become a couple. Meanwhile, she and Paris spend the year as Student Body Presidents at Chilton and both submit applications to [[Harvard University]]. Paris is devastated when she doesn't get in. Rory is accepted but decides to attend [[Yale University]] instead, much to Emily and Richard's delight. The Independence Inn is badly damaged in a fire, but Lorelai and Sookie are able to buy the Dragonfly when its elderly owner dies. Jess pressures Rory to have sex with him, which leads to a fight between Dean and Jess. Luke begins dating a lawyer named Nicole. Lane Kim, Rory's best friend, starts a band called Hep Alien and tries to convince her strict mother to let her date the guitarist, Dave, while keeping the band secret. As the season ends, Jess abruptly leaves Stars Hollow to track down his estranged father in California, and Rory graduates High School as [[valedictorian]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 4)}}\n\nRory starts her college education at Yale, with Paris \u2013 now a friend \u2013 as her roommate. Both start working for the [[Yale Daily News]]. Rory is surprised when Dean quickly marries his new girlfriend. The pair grow closer again over the season, leading Rory to turn down Jess when he returns and declares his love. Lorelai spends the season renovating the Dragonfly Inn in preparation for its opening, along with Sookie and their colleague Michel. She also begins a relationship with Richard's new business partner, Jason Stiles, which she keeps secret from her parents. Lane's mother learns about Hep Alien and throws her out of the house. Sookie and Jackson have a son. Lorelai and Jason break up after Jason sues Richard for leaving their partnership and Lorelai sides with her father. Emily feels neglected by Richard and the two separate, with Richard moving into the pool house. Luke and Nicole [[elope]] during a cruise, but quickly decide to divorce. Towards the end of the season, Luke accepts that he is in love with Lorelai and begins wooing her. The pair finally kiss on the Dragonfly's opening night, while Rory loses her virginity to a married Dean.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 5)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke start a relationship. Emily and Richard \u2013 who reunite and renew their wedding vows \u2013 disapprove and Emily interferes by telling Christopher to try to win her back. Luke feels overwhelmed, resulting in a brief separation between him and Lorelai and a rift between Lorelai and Emily. Rory tries to have another relationship with Dean, now separated from his wife after she found out about the affair, but it soon ends when he realizes how different their lives are. She falls for Logan Huntzberger, a wealthy playboy Yale student whose parents think she is beneath him. Lane and Paris both start relationships: the former with her bandmate Zack, the latter with Yale Daily News editor Doyle. Sookie has a daughter. Rory gets an internship at Logan's father's newspaper but is deflated when he tells her she \"doesn't have it.\" Rory lashes out due to this and she and Logan are arrested for stealing a yacht, after which Rory announces that she is quitting Yale and moves in with her grandparents at their pool house. When Lorelai sees how supportive Luke is over the situation, she asks him to marry her.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 6)}}\n\nLorelai is devastated by Rory's actions but insists that she can't force her back to Yale: it's a decision Rory must make for herself. Mother and daughter don't speak for six months. Rory has to complete [[community service]] and Emily gets her a job with the [[Daughters of the American Revolution|DAR]]. Richard becomes concerned but eventually, after encouragement from Jess, Rory returns to Yale and reunites with Lorelai. She replaces Paris as editor of the Yale Daily News, which causes issues in their friendship, and after a short separation from Logan the relationship gets serious. Rory is crushed when Logan's father sends him to work in London. Hep Alien disband then come back together; Lane and Zack get married. Lorelai plans a wedding with Luke, but things get difficult when Luke learns that he has a 12-year-old daughter named April. He starts building a relationship with her but keeps Lorelai separate. Lorelai tries to accept this but eventually snaps and issues him an ultimatum. When he doesn't agree to elope, Lorelai goes to Christopher for comfort.\n\n=== Season 7 ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls (season 7)}}\n\nLorelai and Luke officially split when she tells him she slept with Christopher. Before much time has passed, Christopher convinces Lorelai to try a relationship. The pair spontaneously marry during a trip in Paris, but Lorelai soon accepts that it isn't right and they split amicably. Luke has a custody battle over April, after her mother moves them to New Mexico, and wins the right to see her during holidays. Lane and Zack have twins, and Sookie becomes pregnant again. Rory completes her final year of college. She and Logan spend half the season in a long-distance relationship until he eventually moves back to New York. He proposes, but Rory says that she wants to keep her options open, which leads to their separation. She panics about what she will do after graduating; following some rejection, she gets a job reporting on the [[Barack Obama]] campaign trail. Stars Hollow throws a surprise goodbye party for Rory. When Lorelai finds out that Luke organized it, the pair reconcile with a kiss. Lorelai promises Emily that she will continue attending Friday Night Dinners. Before Lorelai and Rory have to say goodbye, they have one last breakfast at Luke's Diner.\n\n=== ''A Year in the Life'' ===\n{{main|Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life}}\n\nNine years after the end of the original series, Netflix produced a ''Gilmore Girls'' revival miniseries. Rory is struggling in her journalism career and having a no-strings-attached, secret affair with Logan in London, while technically having a boyfriend named Paul that she often forgets about. While Logan is engaged to be married the two of them can't seem to stay apart. Lorelai and Luke live together but are still having communication problems. Richard has recently died of a heart attack, which causes tension between Lorelai and Emily and they end up in joint therapy. Lorelai starts to question her life, so travels to California with intentions to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, where she has an epiphany: she fixes the rift with Emily by recounting a happy story about Richard, and goes home to propose to Luke. Emily decides to sell the Gilmore mansion and move to [[Nantucket]], where she starts working in a museum. After encouragement from Jess, Rory decides to write a book about her life called \"Gilmore Girls\".
