In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way.\"<ref name=\"anglicans-whalon\"/> De{{nbsp}}Havilland prefers to use the [[Revised English Bible]] for its poetic style.<ref name=\"anglicans-whalon\"/> She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gis\u00e8le in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the faith of each child's father.{{sfn|De Havilland|1962|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nAs a United States citizen,<ref name=\"cnn-facts\"/> de{{nbsp}}Havilland became involved in politics as a way of exercising her civic responsibilities.<ref name=\"wsj-meroney\"/> She campaigned for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s re-election in 1944.<ref name=\"wsj-meroney\"/> After the war, she joined the Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions, a national public policy advocacy group that included Bette Davis, [[Gregory Peck]], [[Groucho Marx]], and [[Humphrey Bogart]] in its Hollywood chapter.<ref name=\"wsj-meroney\"/> In June 1946, she was asked to deliver speeches for the committee that reflected the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] line{{nsmdns}}the group was later identified as a [[Communist front]] organization.{{sfn|Billingsley|1998|pp=123\u2013124}} Disturbed at seeing a small group of [[Communism|Communist]] members manipulating the committee, she removed the pro-Communist material from her speeches and rewrote them to reflect [[Harry S. Truman]]'s anti-Communist platform. She later recalled, \"I realized a nucleus of people was controlling the organization without a majority of the members of the board being aware of it. And I knew they had to be Communists.\"<ref name=\"wsj-meroney\"/>\n\nShe organized a fight to regain control of the committee from its pro-Soviet leadership, but her reform efforts failed. Her resignation from the committee triggered a wave of resignations from 11 other Hollywood figures, including future President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=\"wsj-meroney\"/>{{#tag:ref|Reagan was a relatively new board member when he was invited to join 10 other film-industry colleagues, including MGM studio head [[Dore Schary]], for a meeting at de{{nbsp}}Havilland's house where he first learned that Communists were trying to gain control of the committee.{{sfn|Reagan|1990|p=112}} During the meeting, he turned to de{{nbsp}}Havilland, who was on the executive committee, and whispered, \"You know, Olivia, I always thought ''you'' might be one of them.\" Laughing, she responded, \"That's funny. I thought ''you'' were one of them.\" Reagan suggested they propose a resolution at the next meeting that included language reaffirmed the committee's \"belief in free enterprise and the Democratic system\" and repudiated \"Communism as desirable for the United States\"{{nsmdns}}the executive committee voted it down the following week.{{sfn|Reagan|1990|pp=112\u2013113}} Shortly afterwards, the committee disbanded, only to resurface as a newly named front organization.{{sfn|Reagan|1990|p=112}} Despite organizing Hollywood resistance to Soviet influence, de{{nbsp}}Havilland was denounced later that year as a \"[[Pinko|swimming-pool pink]]\" in ''Time'' magazine for her involvement in the committee.{{sfn|Gottfried|2002|p=146}}|group=Note}} In 1958, she was secretly called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and recounted her experiences with the Independent Citizens' Committee.<ref name=\"wsj-meroney\"/>\n\n===Relationship with Joan Fontaine===\n[[File:Joan Fontaine and Gary Cooper.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Joan Fontaine and Gary Cooper holding Oscars|Joan Fontaine and [[Gary Cooper]] at the Academy Awards, 1942]]\nDe Havilland and her sister [[Joan Fontaine]] are the only siblings to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category.<ref name=\"time-berman\"/> According to biographer [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]], the sisters always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when Olivia had trouble accepting the idea of having a younger sister, and Joan resenting her mother's favoring Olivia. Olivia would rip up the clothes that her sister was given to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan to stitch them together again.<ref name=\"independent-cornwell\"/> This tension was made worse by Fontaine's frequent childhood illnesses, which led to her mother's overly protective expression \"Livvie can, Joan can't.\"{{sfn|Thomas|1983|p=24}} De{{nbsp}}Havilland was the first to become an actress, and for several years Fontaine was overshadowed by her sister's accomplishments. When [[Mervyn LeRoy]] offered Fontaine a personal contract, her mother told her that Warner Bros. was \"Olivia's studio\" and that she could not use the family name \"de{{nbsp}}Havilland\".{{sfn|Fontaine|1978|p=72}}\n\nIn 1942, de{{nbsp}}Havilland and Fontaine were both nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress{{nsmdns}}de{{nbsp}}Havilland for ''Hold Back the Dawn'' and Fontaine for ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]''. When Fontaine's name was announced as winner, de{{nbsp}}Havilland reacted graciously saying \"We've got it!\"{{sfn|Kass|1976|p=69}} According to biographer Charles Higham, Fontaine rejected de{{nbsp}}Havilland's attempts to congratulate her, leaving the other offended and embarrassed.{{sfn|Higham|1984|p=257}}\n\nTheir relationship was strained further in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about de{{nbsp}}Havilland's new husband Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, de{{nbsp}}Havilland was deeply hurt and waited for an apology that never was offered.<ref name=\"hr-feinberg-feud\"/> The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for ''To Each His Own'', de{{nbsp}}Havilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; de{{nbsp}}Havilland turned away from her sister.<ref name=\"hr-feinberg-feud\"/> The two did not speak for the next five years after the incident.{{#tag:ref|In 1957, in the only interview in which she ever commented on her relationship with her sister, de{{nbsp}}Havilland told the Associated Press \"Joan is very bright and sharp and has a wit that can be cutting. She said some things about Marcus that hurt me deeply. She was aware there was an estrangement between us.\"<ref name=\"hr-feinberg-feud\"/>|group=Note}} This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt.{{sfn|Higham|1984|p=257}}\n\nFollowing her divorce from Goodrich, de{{nbsp}}Havilland resumed contact with her sister,<ref name=\"hr-feinberg-feud\"/> coming to her apartment in New York and spending Christmas together in 1961.<ref name=\"hr-feinberg-feud\"/><ref name=\"getty-galella\"/> The final break between the sisters occurred in 1975 over disagreements over their mother's cancer treatment{{nsmdns}}de{{nbsp}}Havilland wanted to consult other doctors and supported exploratory surgery; Fontaine disagreed.{{sfn|Fontaine|1978|p=298}} Fontaine later claimed her sister had not notified her of their mother's death while she was touring with a play{{nsmdns}}de{{nbsp}}Havilland in fact had sent a telegram, which took two weeks to reach her sister.<ref name=\"independent-cornwell\"/> The sibling feud ended with Fontaine's death on December 15, 2013.<ref name=\"hr-feinberg-feud\"/>{{#tag:ref|Fontaine once remarked, \"I married first, won the Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she'll undoubtedly be livid because I beat her to it!\"<ref name=\"wp-bernstein\"/>|group=Note}} The following day, de{{nbsp}}Havilland released a statement saying she was \"shocked and saddened\" by the news.<ref name=\"cbsnews-djansezian-shocked\"/>\n\n==Career assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Olivia de Havilland's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|alt=Five-pointed star with her name and an image of an old film camera|Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6762 Hollywood Blvd.<ref name=\"hollywood-walk\"/>]]\nDe{{nbsp}}Havilland's career spanned 53 years, from 1935 to 1988.<ref name=\"tcm-filmography\"/> During that time, she appeared in 49 feature films, and was one of the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She began her career playing demure ing\u00e9nues opposite male stars such as Errol Flynn, with whom she made her breakout film ''Captain Blood'' in 1935. They would go on to make eight more feature films together, and became one of Hollywood's most successful on-screen romantic pairings.<ref name=\"tcm-bio\"/> Her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', de{{nbsp}}Havilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as ''The Great Garrick'' and ''Hard to Get'', and Western adventure films, such as ''Dodge City'' and ''Santa Fe Trail''.<ref name=\"tcm-filmography\"/> In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such as ''In This Our Life'' and ''Light in the Piazza'', and psychological dramas playing non-glamorous characters in films such as ''The Dark Mirror'', ''The Snake Pit'', and ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]''.<ref name=\"tcm-bio\"/>\n\nDuring her career, de{{nbsp}}Havilland won two Academy Awards (''To Each His Own'' and ''The Heiress''), two Golden Globe Awards (''The Heiress'' and ''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna''), two New York Film Critics Circle Awards (''The Snake Pit'' and ''The Heiress''), the National Board of Review Award, and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup (''The Snake Pit''), and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination (''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'').<ref name=\"tcm-milestones\"/>\n\nFor her contributions to the motion picture industry, de{{nbsp}}Havilland received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6762 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960.<ref name=\"hollywood-walk\"/> Since her retirement in 1988, her lifetime contribution to the arts has been honored on two continents.

It has occasionally been won by other means, such as an auction for the belt, [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]], and even a title change that occurred in a dream.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nThe title is typically defended during a 10-minute [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], with the current holder not being allowed to leave the match until the end of the time limit; as per 24/7 rules, the championship can change hands during, and not only as the result, of the match. Unlike its name suggests, and unlike similarly titled championships, it is not specific to [[Iron Man match]]es.<ref name=\"Official\"/> The record for most reigns is held by [[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]], who won it 216 times, including by trading the title back-and-forth with 215-times champion [[Yuko Miyamoto]] a total of 303 times on the same night. The 1,000th Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion was crowned on April 29, 2014, when the title belt itself became the champion by pinning [[Sanshiro Takagi]].\n\n== Title history ==\n;Key\n{| class=\"wikitable\";

==\nAs of August 2019, there have been over 1,400 title changes for the belt, which has been won by numerous male and female wrestlers and non-wrestlers, including children, animals, entire audiences and inanimate objects.\n\n=== Animals ===\n*Yatchan - A monkey\n*Cocolo - A miniature [[Dachshund]] dog.\n*Bunny - A cat\n\n=== Inanimate objects ===\n*Ladder - a steel ladder. Would fall on the champion and a pinfall was counted. Ladder successfully defended the title by not being pinned during the time limit battle royal matches. Ladder was a three-time champion and the first inanimate object to win the title.\n*Kitty-Chan - a stuffed '[[Hello Kitty]]' doll\n*Mah-Kun - another stuffed doll, who defeated 'Kitty-Chan' for the belt\n*A baseball bat - lost the belt after being broken in half as a 'KO' decision\n*Chiririn - a chicken doll\n*Mr. Kasai - a stuffed [[Jun Kasai]] doll. Mr. Kasai has won the belt twice.\n*A [[Pro Wrestling Wave]] poster.\n*[[Big Japan Pro Wrestling]] ring truck.\n*[[Ice Ribbon]] ringside mat.\n*A pint of beer.\n*A stick of [[yakitori]].\n*A steel chair.\n*\"K\u014dmy\u014d\", a painting by [[Akihiro Miwa]].\n*The title belt itself.\n*Akihiro, another inflatable 'love doll'. Made its debut on August 18, 2013.\n*Yoshihiko - An inflatable 'love doll' and the supposed brother of Akihiro. Wrestlers treat it as if it actually was an active wrestler, and actually sell moves \"done\" by him/her, mostly high flying moves. For some moves, like outside dives, Yoshihiko is helped by one or more assistants, who throw him out of the ring, pull his foot on the ropes, etc. Opposing wrestlers make like those assistants are not there and are part of Yoshihiko. The original Yoshihiko was \"killed\" by an Antonio Honda knee drop, which caused its head to burst open, and was replaced by a second Yoshihiko, who was also a 'love doll', only modified to resemble the [[Great Muta]]. The second Yoshihiko was killed by [[Kenny Omega]] by a giant swing that sent Yoshihiko out of the ring, thus splitting his head open and revealing cotton stuffing. Later on in that match however, a third Yoshihiko came out resembling [[The Undertaker]]'s old American Bad Ass gimmick, even using the same theme music. Following that match, the third Yoshihiko was shot to death by Antonio Honda. A fourth Yoshihiko, resembling [[Hulk Hogan]], debuted shortly afterwards.\n*[[Vince McMahon]]'s [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star\n*A bus\n*[[TV Tokyo]] camera crane\n*Pork bun\n*A [[kotatsu]] table\n*A trash bin\n*Pair of chopsticks\n*RN: Konyamoanokodenuitarou - A printed E-mail\n*Beer Can - Champion Yukio Sakaguchi drank from the can and fell backwards with the can on top of him. The referee counted the pin. The can lost the belt after Yuki Ueno drank its remaining contents.\n\n===Non-existent===\n\n*Arnold Skeskejanaker - An \"invisible wrestler\" i.e. non-existent. Opponents sell moves of a wrestler who isn't there, and the title is held by nothing and no-one but the wrestlers and referees act as if they can see and pin the \"invisible wrestler\". Muscle Sakai \"won\" the title from this \"invisible wrestler\" by using a \"ray gun\" and \"infrared visor\" to shoot the \"invisible wrestler\", winning the belt on a KO decision.\n*The Invisible Man - Another \"invisible wrestler\"\n\n===Collective champions===\n*Three elementary school girls (Airi Ueda, Shiori Takahashi and Minami Tanabe)\n*[[The Addiction (professional wrestling)|The Addiction]] ([[Christopher Daniels]] and [[Frankie Kazarian]]).\n*The entire audience of Beyond Wrestling's Americanrana '16.\n*[[The Young Bucks]] (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson).\n*[[Hiroshi Yamato]] and [[Toru Owashi]].\n*Mizuki Watase, Antonio Honda, [[Danshoku Dino]] and Yukio Naya\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan}}\n*[[Dramatic Dream Team]]\n*[[Puroresu]] \u2013 overview of Japanese professional wrestling\n*[[WWE Hardcore Championship]] \u2013 a title with a similar 24/7 rule\n*[[WWE 24/7 Championship]] \u2013 another title with a similar 24/7 rule\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n;General\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/ddt/ironman-hm.html|title=Ironman Heavymetalweight Title|work=Wrestling-Titles.com|accessdate=2016-07-20}}\n;Specific\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:DDT Pro-Wrestling championships]]\n[[Category:Hardcore wrestling championships]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox pro wrestling championship\n|name=Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship\n|image=\n|image_size=\n|alt=\n|caption=\n|currentholder=[[Toru Owashi]]\n|won=March 20, 2020\n|aired=\n|created=June 29, 2000\n|promotion=[[DDT Pro-Wrestling]]\n|firstchamp=[[Poison Julie Sawada|Poison Sawada Black]]\n|mostreigns=[[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]] (216 reigns)\n|longestreign=[[Masa Takanashi]] (333 days)\n}}\nThe {{nihongo|'''Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30de\u30f3\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u7d1a\u738b\u5ea7|aianman heb\u012bmetaru-ky\u016b \u014dza}} is a [[professional wrestling championship]] owned by the [[Dramatic Dream Team|DDT Pro-Wrestling]] promotion. A comedic championship, it was created as a parody of [[WWE]]'s [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] and follows the same 24/7 rules, meaning it is constantly being defended anywhere against anyone, even outside of matches, during unrelated matches, or outside a ring, as anyone (or anything) can become champion by pinning the champion or making him submit as long as a [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] is there to confirm the win.<ref name=\"Official\">{{cite web|url=https://dramaticddt.wordpress.com/ddt-title-history/iron-man-heavymetalweight-championship/|title=Iron Man Heavymetalweight Championship|publisher=Dramatic DDT}}</ref><ref name=\"Wrestling Titles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/ddt/ironman-hm.html|title=Ironman Heavymetalweight Title (Japan)|publisher=Wrestling-Title}}</ref> As such, not only is the championship winnable regardless of gender or number of individuals (in case of a common pinfall or submission), it is also available to \"unconventional\" champions, with past champions including referees, children, animals, and inanimate objects. It has occasionally been won by other means, such as an auction for the belt, [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]], and even a title change that occurred in a dream.<ref name=\"Official\"/>\n\nThe title is typically defended during a 10-minute [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], with the current holder not being allowed to leave the match until the end of the time limit; as per 24/7 rules, the championship can change hands during, and not only as the result, of the match. Unlike its name suggests, and unlike similarly titled championships, it is not specific to [[Iron Man match]]es.<ref name=\"Official\"/> The record for most reigns is held by [[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]], who won it 216 times, including by trading the title back-and-forth with 215-times champion [[Yuko Miyamoto]] a total of 303 times on the same night. The 1,000th Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion was crowned on April 29, 2014, when the title belt itself became the champion by pinning [[Sanshiro Takagi]].\n\n== Title history ==\n;Key\n{| class=\"wikitable\";

==\nAs of August 2019, there have been over 1,400 title changes for the belt, which has been won by numerous male and female wrestlers and non-wrestlers, including children, animals, entire audiences and inanimate objects.\n\n=== Animals ===\n*Yatchan - A monkey\n*Cocolo - A miniature [[Dachshund]] dog.\n*Bunny - A cat\n\n=== Inanimate objects ===\n*Ladder - a steel ladder. Would fall on the champion and a pinfall was counted. Ladder successfully defended the title by not being pinned during the time limit battle royal matches. Ladder was a three-time champion and the first inanimate object to win the title.\n*Kitty-Chan - a stuffed '[[Hello Kitty]]' doll\n*Mah-Kun - another stuffed doll, who defeated 'Kitty-Chan' for the belt\n*A baseball bat - lost the belt after being broken in half as a 'KO' decision\n*Chiririn - a chicken doll\n*Mr. Kasai - a stuffed [[Jun Kasai]] doll.

Made its debut on August 18, 2013.\n*Yoshihiko - An inflatable 'love doll' and the supposed brother of Akihiro. Wrestlers treat it as if it actually was an active wrestler, and actually sell moves \"done\" by him/her, mostly high flying moves. For some moves, like outside dives, Yoshihiko is helped by one or more assistants, who throw him out of the ring, pull his foot on the ropes, etc. Opposing wrestlers make like those assistants are not there and are part of Yoshihiko. The original Yoshihiko was \"killed\" by an Antonio Honda knee drop, which caused its head to burst open, and was replaced by a second Yoshihiko, who was also a 'love doll', only modified to resemble the [[Great Muta]]. The second Yoshihiko was killed by [[Kenny Omega]] by a giant swing that sent Yoshihiko out of the ring, thus splitting his head open and revealing cotton stuffing. Later on in that match however, a third Yoshihiko came out resembling [[The Undertaker]]'s old American Bad Ass gimmick, even using the same theme music. Following that match, the third Yoshihiko was shot to death by Antonio Honda. A fourth Yoshihiko, resembling [[Hulk Hogan]], debuted shortly afterwards.\n*[[Vince McMahon]]'s [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star\n*A bus\n*[[TV Tokyo]] camera crane\n*Pork bun\n*A [[kotatsu]] table\n*A trash bin\n*Pair of chopsticks\n*RN: Konyamoanokodenuitarou - A printed E-mail\n*Beer Can - Champion Yukio Sakaguchi drank from the can and fell backwards with the can on top of him. The referee counted the pin. The can lost the belt after Yuki Ueno drank its remaining contents.\n\n===Non-existent===\n\n*Arnold Skeskejanaker - An \"invisible wrestler\" i.e. non-existent. Opponents sell moves of a wrestler who isn't there, and the title is held by nothing and no-one but the wrestlers and referees act as if they can see and pin the \"invisible wrestler\". Muscle Sakai \"won\" the title from this \"invisible wrestler\" by using a \"ray gun\" and \"infrared visor\" to shoot the \"invisible wrestler\", winning the belt on a KO decision.\n*The Invisible Man - Another \"invisible wrestler\"\n\n===Collective champions===\n*Three elementary school girls (Airi Ueda, Shiori Takahashi and Minami Tanabe)\n*[[The Addiction (professional wrestling)|The Addiction]] ([[Christopher Daniels]] and [[Frankie Kazarian]]).\n*The entire audience of Beyond Wrestling's Americanrana '16.\n*[[The Young Bucks]] (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson).\n*[[Hiroshi Yamato]] and [[Toru Owashi]].\n*Mizuki Watase, Antonio Honda, [[Danshoku Dino]] and Yukio Naya\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan}}\n*[[Dramatic Dream Team]]\n*[[Puroresu]] \u2013 overview of Japanese professional wrestling\n*[[WWE Hardcore Championship]] \u2013 a title with a similar 24/7 rule\n*[[WWE 24/7 Championship]] \u2013 another title with a similar 24/7 rule\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n;General\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/ddt/ironman-hm.html|title=Ironman Heavymetalweight Title|work=Wrestling-Titles.com|accessdate=2016-07-20}}\n;Specific\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:DDT Pro-Wrestling championships]]\n[[Category:Hardcore wrestling championships]]\n", "name_user": "Chrism", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTitle history", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Heavymetalweight_Championship"}

It was subsequently renamed \"Vaughan\u2014King\u2014Aurora\".\n\nIt existed only for the [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997]] and [[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]] elections.\n\nIt was abolished in 2004, as ridings in York Region were redistributed due to its fast-growing population. The riding was redistributed into [[Newmarket\u2014Aurora]], [[Oak Ridges\u2014Markham]], and [[Vaughan (electoral district)|Vaughan]] ridings.\n\n==Provincial riding==\nThe provincial riding of Vaughan\u2014King\u2014Aurora was created before the [[1999 Ontario general election|1999 election]] when Ontario provincial electoral districts were redefined to be the same as the federal districts.
