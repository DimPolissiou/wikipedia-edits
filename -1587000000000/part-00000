It is regarded as one of the world's greatest cultural monuments.]]\n{{Culture of Greece}}\n\nThe '''culture of Greece''' has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in [[Mycenaean Greece|Minoan and later in Mycenaean Greece]], continuing most notably into [[Classical Greece]], through the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor the [[Byzantine Empire]].  Other cultures and states such as the [[Frankokratia|Frankish states]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Venetian Republic]] and Bavarian and Danish monarchies have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, but historians credit the [[Greek War of Independence]] with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single entity of its multi-faceted culture.\n\n[[Greece]] is widely considered to be the cradle of [[Western culture]]<ref>Mazlish, Bruce.

Modern democracies owe a debt to Greek beliefs in government by the people, trial by jury, and equality under the law.

Web. 25 Jun. 2012.</ref> philosophy, and physics. They introduced such important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry, history, tragedy, and comedy. In their pursuit of order and proportion, the Greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced [[Western art history|Western art]].<ref>Peter Krentz, Ph.D., W. R.

Bir\u0113s, Mar\u014d Kardamits\u0113-Adam\u0113, ''Neoclassical architecture in Greece''</ref> The 19th-century architecture of [[Athens]] and other cities of the [[Greek Kingdom]] is mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]], with architects like [[Theophil Hansen]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[Panagis Kalkos]], [[Lysandros Kaftanzoglou]], [[Anastasios Metaxas]] and [[Stamatios Kleanthis]]. Regarding the churches, Greece also experienced the [[Neo-Byzantine]] revival.\n\nIn 1933 the [[Athens Charter]], a manifesto of the modernist movement, was signed, and was published later by [[Le Corbusier]]. Architects of this movement were among others: the Bauhaus-architect Ioannis Despotopoulos, [[Dimitris Pikionis]], [[Patroklos Karantinos]] and Takis Zenetos. After [[World War II]] and the [[Greek civil war]], the massive construction of [[condominium]]s in the major Greek city centres, was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first [[skyscraper]]s were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the [[OTE Tower]] and the [[Athens Tower 1|Athens Tower Complex]].\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, ''[[Xenia (Hotel)|Xenia]]'' was a nationwide hotel construction program initiated by the Hellenic Tourism Organisation (\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u039f\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd, EOT) to improve the country's tourism infrastructure. It constitutes one of the largest infrastructure projects in modern Greek history. The first manager of the project was the architect Charalambos Sfaellos (from 1950 to 1958) and from 1957 the buildings were designed by a team under [[Aris Konstantinidis]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Greek cinema}}\n[[File:Olympion Cinema Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|Olympion Theatre in [[Thessaloniki]], seat of the [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]].]]\n\nCinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907.  In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films begun. ''Golfo'' (\u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c6\u03c9), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931, [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''\u0394\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a7\u03bb\u03cc\u03b7''), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad.  In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.\n\nThe 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Golden age of Greek cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]], [[Irene Papas]], etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having [[film noir]] elements.  Notable films were ''[[The Counterfeit Coin]]'' (''\u0397 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bb\u03af\u03c1\u03b1'', 1955, directed by [[Giorgos Tzavellas]]), ''Bitter Bread'' (''\u03a0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc \u03a8\u03c9\u03bc\u03af'', 1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), ''[[The Ogre of Athens]]'' (''O Drakos'', 1956, directed by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955, directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed ''[[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba the Greek]]'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. [[Finos Film]] also contributed to this period with movies such as ''\u039b\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1, \u03a6\u03c4\u03ce\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf'', ''[[The Auntie from Chicago]]'' (''\u0397 \u0398\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03a3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf''), ''[[Maiden's Cheek]]'' (''\u03a4\u03bf \u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf \u03b2\u03b3\u03ae\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf''), and many more.  During the 1970s and 1980s [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThere were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora such as the [[Greek Americans|Greek-American]] [[Elia Kazan]].\n\n=== Music and dances ===\n{{Main|Music of Greece|Greek dances|Greek musical instruments}}\n\nGreece has a diverse and highly influential musical tradition, with ancient music influencing the [[Roman Empire]], and Byzantine liturgical chants and secular music influencing [[middle eastern music]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Modern Greek music combines these elements, to carry Greeks' interpretation of a wide range of musical forms.\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\n{{Main|Music of ancient Greece}}\n[[File:Olpe Pan maenad BM F381.jpg|thumb|left|160px|God [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and a [[Maenad]] dancing. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] red-figured [[Wine|olpe]] from [[Apulia]], ca. 320\u2013310 BCE. Pan's right hand fingers are in a snapping position.]]\n\nThe history of music in Greece begins with the music of ancient Greece, largely structured on the [[Lyre]] and other supporting [[string instruments]] of the era. Beyond the well-known structural legacies of the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean scale]], and the related mathematical developments it upheld to define western classical music, relatively little is understood about the precise character of music during this period; we do know, however, that it left, as so often, a strong mark on the culture of [[Rome]]. What has been gleaned about the social role and character of ancient Greek music comes largely from pottery and other forms of [[Greek art]].\n\nAncient Greeks believed that dancing was invented by the [[Ancient Greek Religion|gods]] and therefore associated it with religious ceremony.  They believed that the gods offered this gift to select mortals only, who in turn taught dancing to their fellow-men.\n\nPeriodic evidence in ancient texts indicates that dance was held in high regard, in particular for its educational qualities. Dance, along with writing, music, and physical exercise, was fundamental to the commenced in a circle and ended with the dancers facing one another. When not dancing in a circle the dancers held their hands high or waved them to left and right.  They held cymbals (very like the zilia of today) or a kerchief in their hands, and their movements were emphasized by their long sleeves. As they danced, they sang, either set songs or extemporized ones, sometimes in unison, sometimes in refrain, repeating the verse sung by the lead dancer. The onlookers joined in, clapping the rhythm or singing. Professional singers, often the [[Byzantine music|musicians]] themselves, composed lyrics to suit the occasion.\n\n==== Byzantine Greece ====\n{{main|Byzantine music}}\n[[File:Mosaic of the Female Musicians.jpg|thumb|240px|Late 4th century AD \"Mosaic of the Musicians\" with [[hydraulis]], [[aulos]], and [[lyre]] from a Byzantine villa in [[Maryamin, Hama|Maryamin]], [[Syria]]]]\n\nThe [[Byzantine music]] is also of major significance to the history and development of European music, as [[Liturgy|liturgical chants]] became the foundation and stepping stone for music of the Renaissance (see: [[Renaissance Music]]). It is also certain that Byzantine music included an extensive tradition of instrumental court music and dance; any other picture would be both incongruous with the historically and archaeologically documented opulence of the Eastern Roman Empire. There survive a few but explicit accounts of secular music. A characteristic example is the accounts of pneumatic organs, whose construction was further advanced in the eastern empire prior to their development in the west following the Renaissance.\n\nByzantine instruments included the guitar, single, double or multiple flute, sistrum, timpani (drum), psaltirio, Sirigs, lyre, cymbals, keras and kanonaki.\n\nPopular dances of this period included the ''Syrtos'', ''Geranos'', ''Mantilia'', ''Saximos'', ''Pyrichios'', and ''Kordakas'' . Some of these dances have their origins in the ancient period and are still enacted in some form today.\n\n==== Modern Greece ====\n[[File:Filippoulis with Hatzidakis.tif|thumb|160px|left|[[Manos Hatzidakis]] at the left]]\nA range of domestically and internationally known composers and performers across the musical spectrum have found success in modern Greece, while traditional [[Greek music]] is noted as a mixture of influences from indigenous culture with those of west and east. A few [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] as well as medieval Italian elements can be heard in the traditional songs, ''dhimotik\u00e1'', as well as in the modern [[blues]]y [[rembetika|remb\u00e9tika]] music. A well-known Greek musical instrument is the [[bouzouki]]. \"Bouzouki\" is a descriptive Turkish name, but the instrument itself is probably of Greek origin (from the ancient Greek lute known as [[pandoura]], a kind of guitar, clearly visible in ancient statues, especially female figurines of the \"Tanagraies\" playing cord instruments).\n\n[[File:Mikis Theodorakis Fabrik 070004.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Mikis Theodorakis]], popular composer and songwriter, introduced the [[bouzouki]] into the mainstream culture.]]\n\nFamous Greek musicians and composers of modern era include the central figure of 20th-century European modernism [[Iannis Xenakis]], a composer, architect and theorist. [[Maria Callas]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Dimitris Mitropoulos]], [[Manos Hadjidakis]] and [[Vangelis]] also lead twentieth-century Greek contributions, alongside [[Demis Roussos]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Yanni]], [[Georges Moustaki]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]] and others.\n\nThe birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek:''\u0395\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae'') came through the [[Ionian Islands]] (notable composers include [[Spyridon Samaras]], [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]), while [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the ''Greek National School''.\n\nGreece is one of the few places in Europe where the day-to-day role of folk dance is sustained. Rather than functioning as a museum piece preserved only for performances and special events, it is a vivid expression of everyday life. Occasions for dance are usually weddings, family celebrations, and paneyeria (Patron Saints' name days). Dance has its place in ceremonial customs that are still preserved in Greek villages, such as dancing the bride during a wedding and dancing the [[wikt:trousseau|trousseau]] of the bride during the wedding preparations. The [[carnival]] and Easter offer more opportunities for family gatherings and dancing. Greek [[Taverna|taverns]] providing live entertainment often include folk dances in their program.\n\nRegional characteristics have developed over the years because of variances in [[Climate|climatic conditions]], [[Geography of Greece|land morphology]] and people's social lives. ''Kalamatianos'' and ''Syrtos'' are considered Pan-Hellenic dances and are danced all over the world in diaspora communities. Others have also crossed boundaries and are known beyond the regions where they originated; these include the ''Pentozali'' from [[Crete]], ''Hasapiko'' from Constantinople, ''Zonaradikos'' from [[Thrace]], ''Serra'' from [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]] and ''Balos'' from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean islands]].\n\nThe avant-garde choreographer, director and dancer [[Dimitris Papaioannou]] was responsible for the critically successful [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]], with a conception that reflected the classical influences on modern and experimental Greek dance forms.\n\n=== Painting ===\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\nThere were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece. Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] or [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as [[panel painting]]s. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Bronze Age]], with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like [[Knossos]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]].\n\nMuch of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as [[polychrome]] (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1'', ''\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd'' = many and ''\u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1'' = colour). Due to intensive weathering, polychromy on sculpture and architecture has substantially or totally faded in most cases.\n\n==== Byzantine Greece ====\n{{main|Byzantine Art|Macedonian art (Byzantine)}}\n[[File:Daphni.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic from [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100)]]\n\nByzantine art is the term created for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from about the 5th century AD until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its \"abstract,\" or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]].\n\n==== Post-Byzantine and Modern Greece ====\n{{main|Cretan School|Heptanese School (painting)|Modern Greek art}}\n[[File:Dormition El Greco.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Dormition of the Virgin (El Greco)|Dormition of the Virgin]]'' by [[El Greco]], an example of the [[Cretan School]]]]\n[[File:Lytras Nikiforos Carols.jpeg|thumb|220px|''Carols'' by [[Nikiforos Lytras]]]]\n\nThe term [[Cretan School]] describes an important school of icon painting, also known as Post-Byzantine art, which flourished while [[Crete]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule during the late [[Middle Ages]], reaching its climax after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements. The most famous product of the school, [[El Greco]], was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe.\n\nThe [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School of painting]] succeeded the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing [[Western European]] artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the [[Ionian islands]], which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.\n\nModern Greek painting, after the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]] and the creation of the modern Greek state, began to be developed around the time of [[Romanticism]] and the Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art. Notable painters of the era include [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], [[Georgios Jakobides]], [[Nikiphoros Lytras]], [[Konstantinos Volanakis]] and [[Theodoros Vryzakis]].\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\n{{see also|Ancient Greek sculpture}}\n[[File:ACMA 679 Kore 2.JPG|thumb|160px|''[[Peplos Kore]]'' at the [[Acropolis Museum]]. Relics of the [[polychromy]] are visible.]]\n\nAncient Greek [[monumental sculpture]] was composed almost entirely of [[marble]] or [[bronze]]; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are fortunately easy to form and very durable. [[Chryselephantine]] sculptures, used for temple [[cult image]]s and luxury works, used [[gold]], most often in [[gold leaf|leaf form]] and [[ivory]] for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived.\nBy the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann in the late 20th and early 21st century that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact. Using high-intensity lamps, [[ultraviolet light]], specially designed cameras, plaster casts, and certain powdered minerals, Brinkmann proved that the entire [[Parthenon]], including the actual structure as well as the statues, had been painted.\n\n==== Byzantine Greece ====\nThe Byzantines inherited the [[Early Christian art|early Christian]] distrust of [[monumental sculpture]] in religious art, and produced only [[relief]]s, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from [[Carolingian art]] onwards.  Small ivories were also mostly in relief.\n\nThe so-called \"minor arts\" were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation [[Consular diptych]]s or caskets such as the [[Veroli casket]], [[hardstone carving]]s, enamels, jewelry, metalwork, and [[Byzantine silk|figured silks]] were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology.  Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off silver.\n\n==== Modern Greece ====\n[[File:\u0394\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|160px|\"Discobolus\" statue by [[Konstantinos Dimitriadis]], outside the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]] and the western influence of [[Neoclassicism]], sculpture was re-discovered by the Greek artists. Main themes included the ancient Greek antiquity, the [[Greek War of Independence|War of Independence]] and important figures of the Greek history.\n\nNotable sculptors of the new state were [[Leonidas Drosis]] (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], [[Lazaros Sochos]], [[Georgios Vitalis]], [[Dimitrios Filippotis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Yannoulis Chalepas]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Lazaros Fytalis]].\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\n{{main|Theatre of ancient Greece}}\n[[File:View from the top 777.jpg|thumb|200px|The ancient theatre of [[Epidaurus]] continues to be used for staging ancient Greek plays.]]\n\nTheatre was born in [[Greece]]. The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens]], which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its centre, where it was [[institution]]alised as part of a [[festival]] called the [[Dionysia]], which honoured the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Greek tragedy|Tragedy]] (late 6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (486 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote a common [[cultural identity]].\n\nThe word \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 (''tragoidia''), from which the word \"[[tragedy]]\" is derived, is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (''tragos'') or \"goat\" and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae (''[[ode]]'') meaning \"song\", from \u1f00\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''aeidein''), \"to sing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/tragedy|title=Definition of TRAGEDY|author=|date=|website=m-w.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\nThis etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient [[Cult of Dionysus|Dionysian cults]].

The [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]] was the first theatre and [[opera]] house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' ''The Parliamentary Candidate'' (based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]]) was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by [[revues]], [[Musical theatre|musical comedies]], [[operettas]] and [[nocturnes]] and notable playwrights included [[Spyridon Samaras]], [[Dionysios Lavrangas]], [[Theophrastos Sakellaridis]] and others.\n\nThe [[National Theatre of Greece]] was founded in 1880. Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include [[Alexandros Rizos Rangavis]], [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Angelos Terzakis]], [[Pantelis Horn]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]] and [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], while notable actors include [[Cybele Andrianou]], [[Marika Kotopouli]], [[Aimilios Veakis]], [[Orestis Makris]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Manos Katrakis]] and [[Dimitris Horn]].

In ancient times, as trade in wine became extensive, it was transported from end to end of the Mediterranean; Greek wine had especially high prestige in Italy under the Roman Empire. In the medieval period, wines exported from [[Crete]], [[Monemvasia]] and other Greek ports fetched high prices in northern Europe.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|Education in Greece}}\n[[File:Auth Campus from Bio roof.jpg|thumb|Overview of the campus of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], the largest university in Greece and the Balkans]]\n\n[[Education in Greece]] is compulsory for all children 6\u201315 years old; namely, it includes Primary (Dimotiko) and Lower Secondary (Gymnasio) Education. The school life of the students, however, can start from the age of 2.5 years (pre-school education) in institutions (private and public) called \"Vrefonipiakoi Paidikoi Stathmi\" (creches). In some Vrefonipiakoi Stathmoi there are also Nipiaka Tmimata (nursery classes) which operate along with the Nipiagogeia (kindergartens).\n\nPost-compulsory [[Secondary Education]], according to the reforms of 1997 and 2006, consists of two main school types: Genika Lykeia (General Upper Secondary Schools) and the Epaggelmatika Lykeia (Vocational Upper Secondary Schools), as well as the Epaggelmatikes Sxoles (Vocational Schools). Musical, Ecclesiastical and Physical Education Gymnasia and Lykeia are also in operation.\n\nPost-compulsory Secondary Education also includes the [[Vocational Education|Vocational Training]] Institutes (IEK), which provide formal but unclassified level of education. These Institutes are not classified as an educational level, because they accept both Gymnasio (lower secondary school) and Lykeio (upper secondary school) graduates according to the relevant specializations they provide. Public higher education is divided into Universities and Technological Education Institutes (TEI). Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place at the third grade of Lykeio. Additionally, students are admitted to the Hellenic Open University upon the completion of the 22 year of age by drawing lots.\n\nNea Dimokratia ([[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]), the Greek conservative right political party, has claimed that it will change the law so that private universities gain recognition. Without official recognition, students who have an EES degree are unable to work in the public sector. [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] took some action after [[European Union|EU]] intervention, namely the creation of a special government agency which certifies the vocational status of certain EES degree holders. However, their academic status still remains a problem. The issue of full recognition is still an issue of debate among Greek politicians.\n\nThe [[Institute of Entrepreneurship Development]] (iED) is a Greek Non-governmental organization formed for the promotion of innovation and for enhancing the spirit of entrepreneurship intending to link with other European initiatives.\n\n== Greek people ==\n{{Main|Greek people}}\n[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Alexander the Great]] also known as Alexander III, king of Macedon, was one of the most successful military commanders in history.]]\n\nThe origins of [[Western literature]] and of the main branches of Western learning may be traced to the era of Greek greatness that began before 700 BC with the epics of [[Homer]], the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey''. [[Hesiod]], the first didactic poet, put into epic verse his descriptions of pastoral life, including practical advice on farming, and allegorical myths. The poets [[Alcaeus of Mytilene]], [[Sappho]], [[Anacreon]], and [[Bacchylides]] wrote of love, war, and death in lyrics of great feeling and beauty. [[Pindar]] celebrated the Panhellenic athletic festivals in vivid odes. The fables of the slave [[Aesop]] have been famous for more than 2,500 years. Three of the world's greatest dramatists were [[Aeschylus]], author of the ''Oresteia'' trilogy; [[Sophocles]], author of the [[Sophocles#The Theban plays|Theban plays]]; and [[Euripides]], author of ''Medea'', ''The Trojan Women'', and ''The Bacchae''. [[Aristophanes]], the greatest author of comedies, satirized the mores of his day in a series of brilliant plays. Three great historians were [[Herodotus]], regarded as the father of history, known for ''The Persian Wars''; [[Thucydides]], who generally avoided myth and legend and applied greater standards of historical accuracy in his History of the Peloponnesian War; and [[Xenophon]], best known for his account of the Greek retreat from Persia, the ''Anabasis''. Outstanding literary figures of the Hellenistic period were [[Menander]], the chief representative of a newer type of comedy; the poets [[Callimachus]], [[Theocritus]], and [[Apollonius Rhodius]], author of the ''Argonautica''; and [[Polybius]], who wrote a detailed history of the Mediterranean world. Noteworthy in the Roman period were [[Strabo]], a writer on geography; [[Plutarch]], the father of biography, whose ''Parallel Lives'' of famous Greeks and Romans is a chief source of information about great figures of antiquity; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a travel writer; and [[Lucian]], a satirist.\n\nThe leading philosophers of the period preceding Greece's golden age were [[Thales]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Protagoras]], and [[Democritus]]. [[Socrates]] investigated ethics and politics. His greatest pupil, [[Plato]], used Socrates' question-and-answer method of investigating philosophical problems in his famous dialogues. Plato's pupil [[Aristotle]] established the rules of deductive reasoning but also used observation and inductive reasoning, applying himself to the systematic study of almost every form of human endeavor. Outstanding in the Hellenistic period were [[Epicurus]], the philosopher of moderation; [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of Stoicism; and [[Diogenes of Sinope]], the famous Cynic. The oath of [[Hippocrates]], the father of medicine, is still recited by newly graduating physicians. [[Euclid]] evolved the system of geometry that bears his name. [[Archimedes]] discovered the principles of mechanics and hydrostatics. [[Eratosthenes]] calculated the earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy, and [[Hipparchus]] Founded scientific astronomy. [[Galen]] was an outstanding physician of ancient times.\n\n[[File:El Greco - Portrait of a Man - WGA10554.jpg|thumb|left|The most famous artist born in Greece was probably Dom\u00e9nikos Theotok\u00f3poulos, better known as [[El Greco]] (''The Greek'') in Spain. He did most of his painting there during the late 1500s and early 1600s.]]\n\nThe sculptor [[Phidias]] created the statue of Athena and the figure of Zeus in the temple at Olympia and supervised the construction and decoration of the Parthenon. Another renowned sculptor was [[Praxiteles]].\n\nThe legal reforms of Solon served as the basis of Athenian democracy. The Athenian general [[Miltiades the Younger]] led the victory over the Persians at Marathon in 490 BC, and [[Themistocles]] was chiefly responsible for the victory at Salamis 10 years later. [[Pericles]], the virtual ruler of Athens for more than 25 years, added to the political power of that city, inaugurated the construction of the Parthenon and other noteworthy buildings, and encouraged the arts of sculpture and painting. With the decline of Athens, first Sparta and then Thebes, under the great military tactician [[Epaminondas]], gained the ascendancy; but soon thereafter, two military geniuses, [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his son [[Alexander the Great]], gained control over all of Greece and formed a vast empire stretching as far east as India. It was against Philip that [[Demosthenes]], the greatest Greek orator, directed his diatribes, the ''Philippics''.\n\n[[File:Constantine Cavafy, ca 1900.jpg|thumb|160px|Poet [[Constantine P. Cavafy]]]]\n\nThe most renowned Greek painter during the Renaissance was [[El Greco]], born in [[Crete]], whose major works, painted in Spain, have influenced many 20th-century artists. An outstanding modern literary figure is [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], a novelist and poet who composed a vast sequel to Homer's ''Odyssey''. Leading modern poets are [[Kostis Palamas]], and [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], as well as [[George Seferis]], and [[Odysseus Elytis]], winners of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1963 and 1979, respectively. The work of social theorist [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] is known for its multidisciplinary breadth. Musicians of stature are the composers [[Nikos Skalkottas]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], and [[Mikis Theodorakis]]; the conductor [[Dmitri Mitropoulos]]; and the soprano [[Maria Callas]]. Filmmakers who have won international acclaim are Greek-Americans [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Elia Kazan]], and Greeks [[Michael Cacoyannis]] and [[Costa-Gavras]]. Actresses of note are [[Katina Paxinou]]; [[Melina Mercouri]], who was appointed minister of culture and science in the Socialist cabinet in 1981; and [[Irene Papas]].\n\nOutstanding Greek public figures in the 20th century include Cretan-born [[Eleutherios Venizelos]], prominent statesman of the interwar period; [[Ioannis Metaxas]], dictator from 1936 until his death; [[Constantine Karamanlis]], prime minister (1955\u201363, 1974\u201380) and president (1980\u201385) of Greece; [[George Papandreou]], head of the Center Union Party and prime minister (1963\u201365); and his son [[Andreas Papandreou]], the PASOK leader who became prime minister in 1981. [[Costas Simitis]] was leader of PASOK and prime minister from 1996\u20132004. He was succeeded by [[Kostas Karamanlis]].\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Greek language}}\n[[File:AGMA Ostrakon Cimon.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek [[Ostracon]] bearing the name of [[Cimon]]. [[Stoa of Attalos|Museum of the Ancient Agora]], [[Athens]].]]\n\nThe Greek language is the official language of the [[Hellenic Republic]] and [[Republic of Cyprus]] and has a total of 15 million speakers worldwide; it is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language. It is particularly remarkable in the depth of its continuity, beginning with the pre-historic [[Mycenaean Greek]] and the [[Linear B]] script, and maybe the [[Linear A]] script associated with [[Minoan civilization]], though Linear A is still undeciphered. Greek language is clearly detected in the Mycenaean language and the [[Cypriot syllabary]], and eventually the dialects of [[Ancient Greek]], of which [[Attic Greek]] bears the most resemblance to [[Modern Greek]]. The history of the language spans over 3400 years of written records.\n\nGreek has had enormous impact on other languages both directly on the [[Romance languages]], and indirectly through its influence on the emerging [[Latin]] language during the early days of [[Rome]]. Signs of this influence, and its many developments, can be seen throughout the family of Western European languages.\n\n=== Internet and \"Greeklish\" ===\n\nMore recently, the rise of internet-based communication services as well as cell phones have caused a distinctive form of Greek written partially, and sometimes fully in Latin characters to emerge; this is known as [[Greeklish]], a form that has spread across the Greek diaspora and even to the two countries with majority Greek population, [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]].\n\n=== Katharevousa ===\n{{Main|Katharevousa}}\n\nKathar\u00e9vousa (\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1) is a form of the Greek Language midway between modern and ancient forms set in train during the early nineteenth century by Greek intellectual and revolutionary leader [[Adamantios Korais]], intended to return the Greek language closer to its ancient form. Its influence, in recent years, evolved toward a more formal role, and it came to be used primarily for official purposes such as diplomacy, politics, and other forms of official documentation. It has nevertheless had significant effects on the Greek language as it is still written and spoken today, and both vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical forms have re-entered [[Modern Greek]] via Katharevousa.\n\n=== Dialects ===\nThere are a variety of dialects of the Greek language; the most notable include [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]], [[Cretan dialect|Cretan Greek]] (which is closely related to most [[Aegean Islands]]' dialects), [[Cypriot Greek]], [[Pontic Greek]], the [[Griko language]] spoken in Southern Italy, and [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]], still spoken in the modern prefecture of [[Arcadia]] and widely noted as a surviving regional dialect of [[Doric Greek]].\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Greek literature}}\n[[File:Homer British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Idealized portrait of [[Homer]], [[British Museum]]]]\n\nGreece has a remarkably rich and resilient literary tradition, extending over 2800 years and through several eras. The Classical era is that most commonly associated with [[Greek Literature]], beginning in 800 BCE and maintaining its influence through to the beginnings of [[Byzantine]] period, whereafter the influence of Christianity began to spawn a new development of the Greek written word. The many elements of a millennia-old tradition are reflected in Modern Greek literature, including the works of the Nobel laureates [[Odysseus Elytis]] and [[George Seferis]].\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\n\nThe first recorded works in the western literary tradition are the [[epic poetry|epic]] poems of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. Early Greek [[lyric poetry]], as represented by poets such as [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]], was responsible for defining the lyric [[genre]] as it is understood today in western literature. [[Aesop]] wrote his ''[[Fables]]'' in the 6th century BC. These innovations were to have a profound influence not only on Roman poets, most notably [[Virgil]] in his epic poem on the founding of Rome, ''[[The Aeneid]]'', but one that flourished throughout Europe.\n\nClassical Greece is also judged the birthplace of [[theatre]]. [[Aeschylus]] introduced the ideas of [[dialogue]] and interacting characters to playwriting and in doing so, he effectively invented \"drama\": his ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy of plays is judged his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. [[Aristophanes]], a comic playwright, defined and shaped the idea of [[comedy]] as a theatrical form.\n\n[[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are often attributed with developing the modern study of [[history]] into a field worthy of philosophical, literary, and scientific pursuit. [[Polybius]] first introduced into study the concept of [[Military|military history]].\n\n[[Philosophy]] entered literature in the dialogues of [[Plato]], while his pupil [[Aristotle]], in his work the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', formulated the first set criteria for [[literary criticism]]. Both these literary figures, in the context of the broader contributions of Greek philosophy in the Classical and Hellenistic eras, were to give rise to idea of [[political Science]], the study of political evolution and the critique of governmental systems.\n\n=== Byzantine Greece ===\n{{Main|Byzantine literature}}\n[[File:Suda.jpg|thumb|160px|A page from a 16th-century edition of the 10th century Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]] of the ancient Mediterranean world, the [[Suda]].]]\n\nThe growth of Christianity throughout the [[Greco-Roman]] world in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, together with the Hellenization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the period, would lead to the formation of a unique literary form, combining Christian, Greek, Roman and Oriental  influences. In its turn, this would promote developments such as Cretan poetry, the growth of poetic satire in the [[Greek East]] and the several pre-eminent historians of the period.\n\n=== Modern Greece ===\n{{Main|Modern Greek literature}}\n[[File:Adamantios Korais.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Adamantios Korais]], major figure of the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment]]]]\n\nModern Greek literature refers to literature written in the [[Greek language]] from the 11th century, with texts written in a language that is more familiar to the ears of [[Greeks]] today than is the language of the early Byzantine times.\n\n[[File:Nikos Kazantzakis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Nikos Kazantzakis]], one of the most prominent modern Greek writers]]\n\nThe [[Cretan Renaissance]] poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this early period of modern Greek literature, and represents one of its supreme achievements. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553\u20131613). The other major representative of the [[Cretan literature]] was [[Georgios Chortatzis]] and his most notable work was ''[[Erofili]]''. Other plays include ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros|Kornaros]], ''Panoria'' and ''Katsourbos'' by [[Georgios Chortatzis|Chortatzis]], ''[[King Rodolinos]]'' by [[Andreas Troilos]], ''Stathis (comedy)'' and ''Voskopoula'' by unknown artists.\n\nMuch later, [[Diafotismos]] was an ideological, philological, linguistic and philosophical movement among 18th century Greeks that translate the ideas and values of [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] into the Greek world. [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] are two of the most notable figures. In 1819, ''[[Korakistika]]'', written by [[Iakovakis Rizos Neroulos]], was a [[parody|lampoon]] against the Greek intellectual [[Adamantios Korais]] and his linguistic views, who favoured the use of a more conservative form of the Greek language, closer to the ancient.\n\nThe years before the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the [[Ionian islands]] became the center of the [[Heptanese School (literature)]]. Its main characteristics was the Italian influence, romanticism, nationalism and use of [[Demotic Greek]]. Notable representatives were [[Andreas Laskaratos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Aristotelis Valaoritis]] and [[Dionysios Solomos]].\n\nAfter the independence the intellectual center was transferred in [[Athens]]. A major figure of this new era was [[Kostis Palamas]], considered \"national poet\" of Greece. He was the central figure of the Greek literary generation of the 1880s and one of the cofounders of the so-called [[New Athenian School]] (or Palamian School). Its main characteristic was the use of [[Demotic Greek]]. He was also the writer of the [[Olympic Hymn]].\n\nMoving into the twentieth century, the modern Greek literary tradition spans the work of [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], considered a key figure of twentieth-century poetry, [[Giorgos Seferis]] (whose works and poems aimed to fuse the literature of Ancient and Modern Greece) and [[Odysseas Elytis]], both of whom won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] is also considered a dominant figure, with works such as ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' and ''[[The Greek Passion]]'' receiving international recognition.\n\n== Philosophy, science and mathematics ==\nThe [[Greek world]] is widely regarded as having given birth to scientific thought by means of observation, thought, and development of a theory without the intervention of a supernatural force. [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]] and [[Democritus]] were amongst those contributing significantly to the establishment of this tradition. It is also, and perhaps more commonly in the western imagination, identified with the dawn of [[Western philosophy]], as well as a mapping out of the [[natural science]]s. Greek developments of mathematics continued well up until the decline of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the modern era Greeks continue to contribute to the fields of [[science]], [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]].\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\n{{see also|Greek mathematics|Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek medicine}}\n[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric system]], in the 3rd century BC]]\n\nThe tradition of [[philosophy]] in ancient Greece accompanied its literary development. Greek learning had a profound influence on [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Middle East]]ern civilizations. The works of [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek philosophers profoundly influenced [[Classical civilization|Classical]] thought, the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and the [[Renaissance]].\n\nIn [[medicine]], doctors still refer to the [[Hippocratic oath]], instituted by [[Hippocrates]], regarded as foremost in laying the foundations of medicine as a science. [[Galen]] built on Hippocrates' theory of the [[Humorism|four humours]], and his writings became the foundation of medicine in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] for centuries. The physicians [[Herophilos]] and [[Paulus Aegineta]] were pioneers in the study of [[anatomy]], while [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] wrote an extensive treatise on the practice of [[pharmacology]].\n\nThe period of [[Classical Greece]] (from 800BC until the rise of [[Macedon]], a Greek state in the north) is that most often associated with Greek advances in science. [[Thales of Miletus]] is regarded by many as the father of [[science]]; he was the first of the ancient philosophers to seek to explain the physical world in terms of natural rather than [[supernatural]] causes. [[Pythagoras]] was a [[mathematician]] often described as the \"father of numbers\"; it is believed that he had the pioneering insight into the numerical ratios that determine the [[musical scale]], and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is commonly attributed to him. [[Diophantus|Diophantus of Alexandria]], in turn, was the \"father of [[algebra]]\". Many parts of modern [[geometry]] are based on the work of [[Euclid]], while [[Eratosthenes]] was one of the first scientific [[geographer]]s, calculating the [[circumference]] of the [[earth]] and conceiving the first [[maps]] based on scientific principles.\n\nThe Hellenistic period, following Alexander's conquests, continued and built upon this knowledge. [[Hipparchus]] is considered the pre-eminent astronomical observer of the ancient world, and was probably the first to develop an accurate method for the prediction of [[solar eclipse]], while [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known [[astronomer]] to propose a [[heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]], though the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]] was more commonly accepted until the seventeenth century. Ptolemy also contributed substantially to [[cartography]] and to the science of [[optics]]. For his part [[Archimedes]] was the first to calculate the value of [[pi|''\u03c0'']] and a [[geometric series]], and also the earliest known mathematical [[physicist]] discovering the law of [[buoyancy]], as well as conceiving the [[irrigation]] device known as [[Archimedes' screw]].\n\n=== Byzantine Greece ===\n{{See also|Byzantine science|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\n[[File:Manuel Chrysoloras - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Manuel Chrysoloras]], [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholar in the Renaissance]]]]\n[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli, Pletone, Cappella dei Magi.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Gemistus Pletho]]]]\n\nThe Byzantine period remained largely a period of preservation in terms of classical Greco-Roman texts; there were, however, significant advances made in the fields of [[Byzantine Medicine|medicine]] and [[History|historical scholarship]]. Theological [[philosophy]] also remained an area of study, and there was, while not matching the achievements of preceding ages, a certain increase in the professionalism of study of these subjects, epitomized by the founding of the University of Constantinople.\n\nIsidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles, the architects of the famous [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], also contributed towards mathematical theories concerning architectural form, and the perceived mathematical harmony needed to create a multi-domed structure. These ideas were to prove a heavy influence on the Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] in his creation of the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]], also in Constantinople. Tralles in particular produced several treatises on the [[Natural Sciences]], as well as his other forays into mathematics such as [[Conic Sections]].\n\nThe gradual migration of Greeks from Byzantium to the [[Italian city-states|Italian]] city states following the decline of the Byzantine Empire, and the texts they brought with them combined with the academic positions they held, was a major factor in lighting the first sparks of the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n\n=== Modern Greece ===\n[[File:Caratheodory constantin.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]], who introduced several [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (disambiguation)|mathematical theorems]].]]\n\nGreeks continue to contribute to science and technology in the modern world. [[John Argyris]], a mathematician and engineer, was among the creators of the [[finite element method]] and the [[direct stiffness method]]. [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] made significant contributions to the [[Real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], [[calculus of variations]] and [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], credited with the introduction of several [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (disambiguation)|mathematical theorems]]. In physics, [[John Iliopoulos]] is known for the prediction of the [[charm quark]] and the proposition of the [[GIM mechanism]], as well as the [[Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos D-term]] formula, while [[Dimitri Nanopoulos]] is one of the principal developers of the [[Flipped SU(5)]] model.\n\nBiologist [[Fotis Kafatos]] pioneers in the field of molecular [[cloning]] and [[genomics]], and he was the founding president of the [[European Research Council]]. In medicine, [[Georgios Papanikolaou]] contributed heavily to the development of [[cervical screening]] inventing the [[Pap test]], which is among the most common methods of cervical screening worldwide.\n\nCar designer [[Alec Issigonis]] designed the groundbreaking and iconic [[Mini]] automobile, while [[Michael Dertouzos]] was amongst the pioneers of the [[Internet]], instrumental in defining the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] and director for 27 years of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], which innovated in a variety of areas during his term. [[Nicholas Negroponte]], is the founder of the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the [[One Laptop per Child]] project aiming to extend Internet access in the [[Developing country|developing world]]. [[Joseph Sifakis]], a computer scientist, has won a [[Turing Award]] for his pioneering work on [[model checking]].\n\n== Politics ==\n{{Main|Politics of Greece}}\n[[Image:Athens Parliament 4-2004.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The building of the [[Hellenic Parliament]], the [[Old Royal Palace]] of [[Otto of Greece]].]]\n\nGreece is a [[Parliament]]ary [[Republic]] with a president assuming a more ceremonial role than in some other republics, and the Prime Minister chosen from the leader of the majority party in the parliament. Greece has a codified [[constitution]] and a written Bill of Rights embedded within it. The current Prime Minister is [[Alexis Tsipras]].\n\nThe politics of the third [[Hellenic Republic]] have been dominated by two main political parties, the self-proclaimed socialists of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] and the conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]. Until recently{{when|date=January 2011}} PASOK had dominated the political scene, presiding over favourable growth rates economically but in the eyes of critics failing to deliver where unemployment and structural issues such as market liberalization were concerned.\n\nNew Democracy's election to government in 2004 has led to various initiatives to modernize the country, such as the education university scheme above as well as labour market liberalization. Politically there has been massive opposition to some of these moves owing to a large, well organized workers' movement in Greece, which distrusts the right wing administration and neo-liberal ideas. The population in general appears to accept many of the initiatives, reflected in governmental support; on the economic front many are so far warming to the reforms made by the administration, which have been largely rewarded with above average Eurozone growth rates. New Democracy were re-elected in September 2007.\n\nA number of other smaller political parties exist. They include the third largest party (''the Communist Party''), which still commands large support from many rural working areas as well as some of the immigrant population in Greece, as well as the far-right ''Popular Orthodox Rally'', with the latter, while commanding a mere three and a half per cent of votes, seeking to capitalise on opposition in some quarters regarding Turkey's EU accession and any tension in the Aegean. There is also a relatively small, but well organized anarchist movement, though its status in Greece has been somewhat exaggerated by media overseas.\n\nThe political process is energetically and openly participated in by the people of Greece, while public demonstrations are a continual feature of Athenian life; however, there have been criticisms of a governmental failure to sufficiently involve minorities in political debate and hence a sidelining of their opinions. In general, politics is regarded as an acceptable subject to broach on almost every social occasion, and Greeks are often very vocal about their support (or lack of it) for certain policy proposals, or political parties themselves&nbsp;\u2013 this is perhaps reflected in what many consider the rather sensationalist [[Mass media|media]] on both sides of the political spectrum; although this is a feature of most European tabloids.\n\n== Public holidays and festivals ==\n{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}\n\nAccording to Greek Law every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. In addition, there are four obligatory, official public holidays: March 25 (''Greek Independence Day''), [[Easter Monday]], August 15 (''Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin'') and December 25 (''[[Christmas]]''). Two more days, May 1 (''[[Labour Day]]'') and October 28 (''[[Ohi Day]]''), are regulated by law as optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed National Holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven National Holidays each year.\n\nIn addition to the National Holidays, there Public Holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a \"Patron Saint\", also called \"Name Day\", or a \"Liberation Day\", and at this day is customary for schools to have a day off.\n\nNotable festivals include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]],<ref>[http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586 Thessaloniki International Film Festival&nbsp;\u2013 Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090357/http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586 |date=2015-09-05 }} (in Greek)</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Religion in Greece|Eastern Orthodox Church}}\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\n[[File:Temple of Hephaestus.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Athens]] is the best-preserved of all ancient Greek temples.]]\n\nClassical Athens may be suggested to have heralded some of the same religious ideas that would later be promoted by [[Christianity]], such as [[Aristotle]]'s invocation of a perfect God, and [[Heraclitus]]' [[Logos]]. [[Plato]] considered there were rewards for the virtuous in the heavens and punishment for the wicked under the earth; the soul was valued more highly than the material body, and the material world was understood to be imperfect and not fully real (illustrated in [[Socrates]]'s [[allegory of the cave]]).\n\n=== Hellenistic Greece ===\n\n[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests spread classical concepts about the divine, the [[afterlife]], and much else across the eastern Mediterranean area. [[Jews]] and [[early Christians]] alike adopted the name \"[[hades]]\" when writing about \"[[sheol]]\" in Greek. [[Greco-Buddhism]] was the cultural [[syncretism]] between [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] and [[Buddhism]], which developed in the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]s. By the advent of [[Christianity]], the four original [[Pentarchy|patriarchates]] beyond Rome used Greek as their church language.\n\n=== Byzantine and Modern Greece ===\n[[File:Panagia Tinos.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Our Lady of Tinos]]'', the major Marian shrine in Greece]]\n[[File:Broken vases on Holy Saturday in Corfu.jpg|thumb|180px|Shards of pottery vases on the street, after being thrown from the windows of nearby houses. A [[Holy Saturday]] tradition in [[Corfu]].]]\n\nThe [[Greek Orthodox Church]], largely because of the importance of Byzantium in Greek history, as well as its role in the revolution, is a major institution in modern Greece. Its roles in society and larger role in overarching Greek culture are very important; a number of Greeks attend Church at least once a month or more and the Orthodox [[Easter]] holiday holds special significance.\n\nThe [[Church of Greece]] also retains limited political influence through the fact the Greek constitution does not have an explicit separation of Church and State; a debate suggested by more conservative elements of the church in the early 2000s about identification cards and whether religious affiliation might be added to them highlights the friction between state and church on some issues; the proposal unsurprisingly was not accepted. A widely publicised set of corruption scandals in 2004 implicating a small group of senior churchmen also increased national debate on introducing a greater transparency to the church-state relationship.\n\nGreek Orthodox Churches dot both the villages and towns of Greece and come in a variety of architectural forms, from older Byzantine churches, to more modern white brick churches, to newer cathedral-like structures with evident Byzantine influence. Greece (as well as Cyprus), also polled as, ostensibly, one of the most religious countries in [[Europe]], according to [[Eurostat]]; however, while the church has wide respect as a moral and cultural institution, a contrast in religious belief with Protestant northern Europe is more obvious than one with Catholic Mediterranean Europe.\n\nGreece also has a significant minority of [[Islam|Muslims]] in [[Eastern Thrace]] (numbering around 100\u2013150,000), with their places of worship guaranteed since the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. The Greek state has fully approved the construction a main mosque for the more recent Muslim community of [[Athens]] under the [[freedom of religion]] provisions of the Greek constitution.\n\nOther religious communities living in Greece include [[Roman Catholicism in Greece|Roman Catholics]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses in Greece|Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Protestantism in Greece|Protestants]], [[Armenians in Greece|Armenians]], followers of the ancient Greek religion (see [[Hellenism (religion)]]), [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jews]] and others.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Athens archery.jpg|thumb|200px|Archery matches in [[Panathenaic Stadium]] during the 2004 Olympics.]]\n\n[[Greece]] has risen to prominence in a number of [[sports|sporting areas]] in recent decades. [[Association football|Football]] in particular has seen a rapid transformation, with the [[Greece national football team|Greek national football team]] winning the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship]]. Many Greek athletes have also achieved significant success and have won world and olympic titles in numerous sports during the years, such as [[basketball]], [[wrestling]], [[water polo]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], with many of them becoming international stars inside their sports. The successful organisation of the [[Athens 2004|Athens 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games]] led also to the further development of many sports and has led to the creation of many World class sport venues all over Greece and especially in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. Greek athletes have won a total 146 medals for Greece in 15 different [[Olympic sports]] at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], including the [[Intercalated Games]], an achievement which makes Greece one of the top nations globally, in the world's rankings of medals per capita.\n\n== Symbols ==\n[[File:Greek Independence 1821.svg|thumb|200px|Traditional flag used from 1769 to the War of Independence]]\n\nThe [[national colours of Greece]] are blue and white. The [[coat of arms of Greece]] consists of a white cross on a blue [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] which is surrounded by two [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branches.{{sfn|\u0395\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2|1975|p=Article 2}} The [[Flag of Greece]] is also blue and white, as defined by Law 851/1978 ''Regarding the National Flag''.{{sfn|Law 851/1978|p=Article 1, Clause 1}} It specifies the colour of \"cyan\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc, ''kyano''), meaning \"blue\", so the shade of blue is ambiguous.\n\nThe [[Order of the Redeemer]] and military decoration [[Cross of Valour (Greece)|Cross of Valour]] both have ribbons in the national colours.{{sfn|Presidency of the Hellenic Republic: The Order of the Redeemer}}\n\nSince it was first established, the national emblem has undergone many changes in shape and in design. The original Greek national emblem depicted the goddess [[Athena]] and an [[owl]]. At the time of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the symbol of rebirth, was added.\n\nOther recognizable symbols include the (throughout the [[Byzantine empire]]) [[double-headed eagle]] and the [[Vergina Sun]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Art in modern Greece]]\n* [[Hellenistic period]]\n* [[Hellenic Foundation for Culture]]\n* [[Center for the Greek Language]]\n* [[Cinema of Cyprus]]\n* [[List of Greek films]]\n* [[Education in Greece]]\n* [[List of universities in Greece]]\n* [[Greek Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Syncretism#Ancient Greece|Syncretism in Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Paideia]]\n* [[Gaida]]\n* [[Hellenization]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Bruce Thornton]], ''Greek Ways: How the Greeks Created Western Civilization'', Encounter Books, 2002\n*{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Laurie Kain|title=Culture, Civilization, and Demarcation at the Northwest Borders of Greece|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=26|issue=1|year=1999|pages=196\u2013220|issn=0094-0496|doi=10.1525/ae.1999.26.1.196}}\n* [[Simon Goldhill]], ''Who Needs Greek?: Contests in the Cultural History of Hellenism'', Cambridge University Press, 2002\n* [[Victor Davis Hanson]], John Heath, ''Who Killed Homer: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom'', Encounter Books, 2001\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.hellenism.net Hellenism Network - Greek Culture]\n* [http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/history-of-ancient-greece-22-literature.asp ''Sketch of the History of Greek Literature from the Earliest Times to the Reign of Alexander the Great'' by William Smith]\n* [http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?pageID=106&la=eng ''Anagnosis Books Modern Greek Culture Pages'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050629084248/http://www.adath-shalom.ca/greek_influence.htm The Impact of Greek Culture on Normative Judaism from the Hellenistic Period through the Middle Ages c. 330 BCE- 1250 CE]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060713074229/http://www.seve.gr/sevedetrop/defaulten.htm The Greek diet and its relationship to health]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203235624/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/greece/index.html Greece a cultural profile]\n\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Culture of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culture Of Greece}}\n[[Category:Greek culture| ]]\n[[Category:Indo-European culture|Greek]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Culture of an area}}\n[[File:The Parthenon in Athens.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Parthenon]] is an enduring symbol of [[ancient Greece]] and the [[Athenian democracy]].

Regarding the churches, Greece also experienced the [[Neo-Byzantine]] revival.\n\nIn 1933 the [[Athens Charter]], a manifesto of the modernist movement, was signed, and was published later by [[Le Corbusier]]. Architects of this movement were among others: the Bauhaus-architect Ioannis Despotopoulos, [[Dimitris Pikionis]], [[Patroklos Karantinos]] and Takis Zenetos. After [[World War II]] and the [[Greek civil war]], the massive construction of [[condominium]]s in the major Greek city centres, was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first [[skyscraper]]s were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the [[OTE Tower]] and the [[Athens Tower 1|Athens Tower Complex]].\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, ''[[Xenia (Hotel)|Xenia]]'' was a nationwide hotel construction program initiated by the Hellenic Tourism Organisation (\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u039f\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd, EOT) to improve the country's tourism infrastructure. It constitutes one of the largest infrastructure projects in modern Greek history. The first manager of the project was the architect Charalambos Sfaellos (from 1950 to 1958) and from 1957 the buildings were designed by a team under [[Aris Konstantinidis]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Greek cinema}}\n[[File:Olympion Cinema Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|Olympion Theatre in [[Thessaloniki]], seat of the [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]].]]\n\nCinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907.  In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films begun. ''Golfo'' (\u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c6\u03c9), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931, [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''\u0394\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a7\u03bb\u03cc\u03b7''), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad.  In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.\n\nThe 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Golden age of Greek cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]], [[Irene Papas]], etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having [[film noir]] elements.  Notable films were ''[[The Counterfeit Coin]]'' (''\u0397 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bb\u03af\u03c1\u03b1'', 1955, directed by [[Giorgos Tzavellas]]), ''Bitter Bread'' (''\u03a0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc \u03a8\u03c9\u03bc\u03af'', 1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), ''[[The Ogre of Athens]]'' (''O Drakos'', 1956, directed by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955, directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed ''[[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba the Greek]]'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations.

During the 1970s and 1980s [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThere were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora such as the [[Greek Americans|Greek-American]] [[Elia Kazan]].\n\n=== Music and dances ===\n{{Main|Music of Greece|Greek dances|Greek musical instruments}}\n\nGreece has a diverse and highly influential musical tradition, with ancient music influencing the [[Roman Empire]], and Byzantine liturgical chants and secular music influencing [[middle eastern music]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Modern Greek music combines these elements, to carry Greeks' interpretation of a wide range of musical forms.\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\n{{Main|Music of ancient Greece}}\n[[File:Olpe Pan maenad BM F381.jpg|thumb|left|160px|God [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and a [[Maenad]] dancing. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] red-figured [[Wine|olpe]] from [[Apulia]], ca. 320\u2013310 BCE. Pan's right hand fingers are in a snapping position.]]\n\nThe history of music in Greece begins with the music of ancient Greece, largely structured on the [[Lyre]] and other supporting [[string instruments]] of the era. Beyond the well-known structural legacies of the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean scale]], and the related mathematical developments it upheld to define western classical music, relatively little is understood about the precise character of music during this period; we do know, however, that it left, as so often, a strong mark on the culture of [[Rome]]. What has been gleaned about the social role and character of ancient Greek music comes largely from pottery and other forms of [[Greek art]].\n\nAncient Greeks believed that dancing was invented by the [[Ancient Greek Religion|gods]] and therefore associated it with religious ceremony.  They believed that the gods offered this gift to select mortals only, who in turn taught dancing to their fellow-men.\n\nPeriodic evidence in ancient texts indicates that dance was held in high regard, in particular for its educational qualities. Dance, along with writing, music, and physical exercise, was fundamental to the commenced in a circle and ended with the dancers facing one another. When not dancing in a circle the dancers held their hands high or waved them to left and right.  They held cymbals (very like the zilia of today) or a kerchief in their hands, and their movements were emphasized by their long sleeves. As they danced, they sang, either set songs or extemporized ones, sometimes in unison, sometimes in refrain, repeating the verse sung by the lead dancer. The onlookers joined in, clapping the rhythm or singing. Professional singers, often the [[Byzantine music|musicians]] themselves, composed lyrics to suit the occasion.\n\n==== Byzantine Greece ====\n{{main|Byzantine music}}\n[[File:Mosaic of the Female Musicians.jpg|thumb|240px|Late 4th century AD \"Mosaic of the Musicians\" with [[hydraulis]], [[aulos]], and [[lyre]] from a Byzantine villa in [[Maryamin, Hama|Maryamin]], [[Syria]]]]\n\nThe [[Byzantine music]] is also of major significance to the history and development of European music, as [[Liturgy|liturgical chants]] became the foundation and stepping stone for music of the Renaissance (see: [[Renaissance Music]]). It is also certain that Byzantine music included an extensive tradition of instrumental court music and dance; any other picture would be both incongruous with the historically and archaeologically documented opulence of the Eastern Roman Empire. There survive a few but explicit accounts of secular music. A characteristic example is the accounts of pneumatic organs, whose construction was further advanced in the eastern empire prior to their development in the west following the Renaissance.\n\nByzantine instruments included the guitar, single, double or multiple flute, sistrum, timpani (drum), psaltirio, Sirigs, lyre, cymbals, keras and kanonaki.\n\nPopular dances of this period included the ''Syrtos'', ''Geranos'', ''Mantilia'', ''Saximos'', ''Pyrichios'', and ''Kordakas'' . Some of these dances have their origins in the ancient period and are still enacted in some form today.\n\n==== Modern Greece ====\n[[File:Filippoulis with Hatzidakis.tif|thumb|160px|left|[[Manos Hatzidakis]] at the left]]\nA range of domestically and internationally known composers and performers across the musical spectrum have found success in modern Greece, while traditional [[Greek music]] is noted as a mixture of influences from indigenous culture with those of west and east. A few [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] as well as medieval Italian elements can be heard in the traditional songs, ''dhimotik\u00e1'', as well as in the modern [[blues]]y [[rembetika|remb\u00e9tika]] music. A well-known Greek musical instrument is the [[bouzouki]]. \"Bouzouki\" is a descriptive Turkish name, but the instrument itself is probably of Greek origin (from the ancient Greek lute known as [[pandoura]], a kind of guitar, clearly visible in ancient statues, especially female figurines of the \"Tanagraies\" playing cord instruments).\n\n[[File:Mikis Theodorakis Fabrik 070004.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Mikis Theodorakis]], popular composer and songwriter, introduced the [[bouzouki]] into the mainstream culture.]]\n\nFamous Greek musicians and composers of modern era include the central figure of 20th-century European modernism [[Iannis Xenakis]], a composer, architect and theorist. [[Maria Callas]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Dimitris Mitropoulos]], [[Manos Hadjidakis]] and [[Vangelis]] also lead twentieth-century Greek contributions, alongside [[Demis Roussos]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Yanni]], [[Georges Moustaki]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]] and others.\n\nThe birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek:''\u0395\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae'') came through the [[Ionian Islands]] (notable composers include [[Spyridon Samaras]], [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]), while [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the ''Greek National School''.\n\nGreece is one of the few places in Europe where the day-to-day role of folk dance is sustained. Rather than functioning as a museum piece preserved only for performances and special events, it is a vivid expression of everyday life. Occasions for dance are usually weddings, family celebrations, and paneyeria (Patron Saints' name days). Dance has its place in ceremonial customs that are still preserved in Greek villages, such as dancing the bride during a wedding and dancing the [[wikt:trousseau|trousseau]] of the bride during the wedding preparations. The [[carnival]] and Easter offer more opportunities for family gatherings and dancing. Greek [[Taverna|taverns]] providing live entertainment often include folk dances in their program.\n\nRegional characteristics have developed over the years because of variances in [[Climate|climatic conditions]], [[Geography of Greece|land morphology]] and people's social lives. ''Kalamatianos'' and ''Syrtos'' are considered Pan-Hellenic dances and are danced all over the world in diaspora communities. Others have also crossed boundaries and are known beyond the regions where they originated; these include the ''Pentozali'' from [[Crete]], ''Hasapiko'' from Constantinople, ''Zonaradikos'' from [[Thrace]], ''Serra'' from [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]] and ''Balos'' from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean islands]].\n\nThe avant-garde choreographer, director and dancer [[Dimitris Papaioannou]] was responsible for the critically successful [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]], with a conception that reflected the classical influences on modern and experimental Greek dance forms.\n\n=== Painting ===\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\nThere were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece. Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] or [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as [[panel painting]]s. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Bronze Age]], with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like [[Knossos]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]].\n\nMuch of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as [[polychrome]] (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1'', ''\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd'' = many and ''\u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1'' = colour). Due to intensive weathering, polychromy on sculpture and architecture has substantially or totally faded in most cases.\n\n==== Byzantine Greece ====\n{{main|Byzantine Art|Macedonian art (Byzantine)}}\n[[File:Daphni.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic from [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100)]]\n\nByzantine art is the term created for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from about the 5th century AD until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its \"abstract,\" or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]].\n\n==== Post-Byzantine and Modern Greece ====\n{{main|Cretan School|Heptanese School (painting)|Modern Greek art}}\n[[File:Dormition El Greco.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Dormition of the Virgin (El Greco)|Dormition of the Virgin]]'' by [[El Greco]], an example of the [[Cretan School]]]]\n[[File:Lytras Nikiforos Carols.jpeg|thumb|220px|''Carols'' by [[Nikiforos Lytras]]]]\n\nThe term [[Cretan School]] describes an important school of icon painting, also known as Post-Byzantine art, which flourished while [[Crete]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule during the late [[Middle Ages]], reaching its climax after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements. The most famous product of the school, [[El Greco]], was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe.\n\nThe [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School of painting]] succeeded the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing [[Western European]] artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the [[Ionian islands]], which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.\n\nModern Greek painting, after the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]] and the creation of the modern Greek state, began to be developed around the time of [[Romanticism]] and the Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art. Notable painters of the era include [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], [[Georgios Jakobides]], [[Nikiphoros Lytras]], [[Konstantinos Volanakis]] and [[Theodoros Vryzakis]].\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\n{{see also|Ancient Greek sculpture}}\n[[File:ACMA 679 Kore 2.JPG|thumb|160px|''[[Peplos Kore]]'' at the [[Acropolis Museum]]. Relics of the [[polychromy]] are visible.]]\n\nAncient Greek [[monumental sculpture]] was composed almost entirely of [[marble]] or [[bronze]]; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are fortunately easy to form and very durable. [[Chryselephantine]] sculptures, used for temple [[cult image]]s and luxury works, used [[gold]], most often in [[gold leaf|leaf form]] and [[ivory]] for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived.\nBy the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann in the late 20th and early 21st century that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact. Using high-intensity lamps, [[ultraviolet light]], specially designed cameras, plaster casts, and certain powdered minerals, Brinkmann proved that the entire [[Parthenon]], including the actual structure as well as the statues, had been painted.\n\n==== Byzantine Greece ====\nThe Byzantines inherited the [[Early Christian art|early Christian]] distrust of [[monumental sculpture]] in religious art, and produced only [[relief]]s, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from [[Carolingian art]] onwards.  Small ivories were also mostly in relief.\n\nThe so-called \"minor arts\" were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation [[Consular diptych]]s or caskets such as the [[Veroli casket]], [[hardstone carving]]s, enamels, jewelry, metalwork, and [[Byzantine silk|figured silks]] were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology.  Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off silver.\n\n==== Modern Greece ====\n[[File:\u0394\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|160px|\"Discobolus\" statue by [[Konstantinos Dimitriadis]], outside the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]] and the western influence of [[Neoclassicism]], sculpture was re-discovered by the Greek artists. Main themes included the ancient Greek antiquity, the [[Greek War of Independence|War of Independence]] and important figures of the Greek history.\n\nNotable sculptors of the new state were [[Leonidas Drosis]] (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], [[Lazaros Sochos]], [[Georgios Vitalis]], [[Dimitrios Filippotis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Yannoulis Chalepas]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Lazaros Fytalis]].\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\n==== Ancient Greece ====\n{{main|Theatre of ancient Greece}}\n[[File:View from the top 777.jpg|thumb|200px|The ancient theatre of [[Epidaurus]] continues to be used for staging ancient Greek plays.]]\n\nTheatre was born in [[Greece]]. The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens]], which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its centre, where it was [[institution]]alised as part of a [[festival]] called the [[Dionysia]], which honoured the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Greek tragedy|Tragedy]] (late 6th century BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (486 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there.

The school life of the students, however, can start from the age of 2.5 years (pre-school education) in institutions (private and public) called \"Vrefonipiakoi Paidikoi Stathmi\" (creches). In some Vrefonipiakoi Stathmoi there are also Nipiaka Tmimata (nursery classes) which operate along with the Nipiagogeia (kindergartens).\n\nPost-compulsory [[Secondary Education]], according to the reforms of 1997 and 2006, consists of two main school types: Genika Lykeia (General Upper Secondary Schools) and the Epaggelmatika Lykeia (Vocational Upper Secondary Schools), as well as the Epaggelmatikes Sxoles (Vocational Schools). Musical, Ecclesiastical and Physical Education Gymnasia and Lykeia are also in operation.\n\nPost-compulsory Secondary Education also includes the [[Vocational Education|Vocational Training]] Institutes (IEK), which provide formal but unclassified level of education. These Institutes are not classified as an educational level, because they accept both Gymnasio (lower secondary school) and Lykeio (upper secondary school) graduates according to the relevant specializations they provide. Public higher education is divided into Universities and Technological Education Institutes (TEI). Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place at the third grade of Lykeio. Additionally, students are admitted to the Hellenic Open University upon the completion of the 22 year of age by drawing lots.\n\nNea Dimokratia ([[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]), the Greek conservative right political party, has claimed that it will change the law so that private universities gain recognition. Without official recognition, students who have an EES degree are unable to work in the public sector.

[[Hesiod]], the first didactic poet, put into epic verse his descriptions of pastoral life, including practical advice on farming, and allegorical myths. The poets [[Alcaeus of Mytilene]], [[Sappho]], [[Anacreon]], and [[Bacchylides]] wrote of love, war, and death in lyrics of great feeling and beauty. [[Pindar]] celebrated the Panhellenic athletic festivals in vivid odes. The fables of the slave [[Aesop]] have been famous for more than 2,500 years. Three of the world's greatest dramatists were [[Aeschylus]], author of the ''Oresteia'' trilogy; [[Sophocles]], author of the [[Sophocles#The Theban plays|Theban plays]]; and [[Euripides]], author of ''Medea'', ''The Trojan Women'', and ''The Bacchae''. [[Aristophanes]], the greatest author of comedies, satirized the mores of his day in a series of brilliant plays. Three great historians were [[Herodotus]], regarded as the father of history, known for ''The Persian Wars''; [[Thucydides]], who generally avoided myth and legend and applied greater standards of historical accuracy in his History of the Peloponnesian War; and [[Xenophon]], best known for his account of the Greek retreat from Persia, the ''Anabasis''. Outstanding literary figures of the Hellenistic period were [[Menander]], the chief representative of a newer type of comedy; the poets [[Callimachus]], [[Theocritus]], and [[Apollonius Rhodius]], author of the ''Argonautica''; and [[Polybius]], who wrote a detailed history of the Mediterranean world. Noteworthy in the Roman period were [[Strabo]], a writer on geography; [[Plutarch]], the father of biography, whose ''Parallel Lives'' of famous Greeks and Romans is a chief source of information about great figures of antiquity; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a travel writer; and [[Lucian]], a satirist.\n\nThe leading philosophers of the period preceding Greece's golden age were [[Thales]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Protagoras]], and [[Democritus]]. [[Socrates]] investigated ethics and politics. His greatest pupil, [[Plato]], used Socrates' question-and-answer method of investigating philosophical problems in his famous dialogues. Plato's pupil [[Aristotle]] established the rules of deductive reasoning but also used observation and inductive reasoning, applying himself to the systematic study of almost every form of human endeavor. Outstanding in the Hellenistic period were [[Epicurus]], the philosopher of moderation; [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of Stoicism; and [[Diogenes of Sinope]], the famous Cynic. The oath of [[Hippocrates]], the father of medicine, is still recited by newly graduating physicians. [[Euclid]] evolved the system of geometry that bears his name. [[Archimedes]] discovered the principles of mechanics and hydrostatics. [[Eratosthenes]] calculated the earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy, and [[Hipparchus]] Founded scientific astronomy. [[Galen]] was an outstanding physician of ancient times.\n\n[[File:El Greco - Portrait of a Man - WGA10554.jpg|thumb|left|The most famous artist born in Greece was probably Dom\u00e9nikos Theotok\u00f3poulos, better known as [[El Greco]] (''The Greek'') in Spain. He did most of his painting there during the late 1500s and early 1600s.]]\n\nThe sculptor [[Phidias]] created the statue of Athena and the figure of Zeus in the temple at Olympia and supervised the construction and decoration of the Parthenon. Another renowned sculptor was [[Praxiteles]].\n\nThe legal reforms of Solon served as the basis of Athenian democracy. The Athenian general [[Miltiades the Younger]] led the victory over the Persians at Marathon in 490 BC, and [[Themistocles]] was chiefly responsible for the victory at Salamis 10 years later. [[Pericles]], the virtual ruler of Athens for more than 25 years, added to the political power of that city, inaugurated the construction of the Parthenon and other noteworthy buildings, and encouraged the arts of sculpture and painting. With the decline of Athens, first Sparta and then Thebes, under the great military tactician [[Epaminondas]], gained the ascendancy; but soon thereafter, two military geniuses, [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his son [[Alexander the Great]], gained control over all of Greece and formed a vast empire stretching as far east as India. It was against Philip that [[Demosthenes]], the greatest Greek orator, directed his diatribes, the ''Philippics''.\n\n[[File:Constantine Cavafy, ca 1900.jpg|thumb|160px|Poet [[Constantine P. Cavafy]]]]\n\nThe most renowned Greek painter during the Renaissance was [[El Greco]], born in [[Crete]], whose major works, painted in Spain, have influenced many 20th-century artists. An outstanding modern literary figure is [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], a novelist and poet who composed a vast sequel to Homer's ''Odyssey''. Leading modern poets are [[Kostis Palamas]], and [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], as well as [[George Seferis]], and [[Odysseus Elytis]], winners of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1963 and 1979, respectively. The work of social theorist [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] is known for its multidisciplinary breadth. Musicians of stature are the composers [[Nikos Skalkottas]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], and [[Mikis Theodorakis]]; the conductor [[Dmitri Mitropoulos]]; and the soprano [[Maria Callas]]. Filmmakers who have won international acclaim are Greek-Americans [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Elia Kazan]], and Greeks [[Michael Cacoyannis]] and [[Costa-Gavras]]. Actresses of note are [[Katina Paxinou]]; [[Melina Mercouri]], who was appointed minister of culture and science in the Socialist cabinet in 1981; and [[Irene Papas]].\n\nOutstanding Greek public figures in the 20th century include Cretan-born [[Eleutherios Venizelos]], prominent statesman of the interwar period; [[Ioannis Metaxas]], dictator from 1936 until his death; [[Constantine Karamanlis]], prime minister (1955\u201363, 1974\u201380) and president (1980\u201385) of Greece; [[George Papandreou]], head of the Center Union Party and prime minister (1963\u201365); and his son [[Andreas Papandreou]], the PASOK leader who became prime minister in 1981. [[Costas Simitis]] was leader of PASOK and prime minister from 1996\u20132004. He was succeeded by [[Kostas Karamanlis]].\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Greek language}}\n[[File:AGMA Ostrakon Cimon.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek [[Ostracon]] bearing the name of [[Cimon]]. [[Stoa of Attalos|Museum of the Ancient Agora]], [[Athens]].]]\n\nThe Greek language is the official language of the [[Hellenic Republic]] and [[Republic of Cyprus]] and has a total of 15 million speakers worldwide; it is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language. It is particularly remarkable in the depth of its continuity, beginning with the pre-historic [[Mycenaean Greek]] and the [[Linear B]] script, and maybe the [[Linear A]] script associated with [[Minoan civilization]], though Linear A is still undeciphered. Greek language is clearly detected in the Mycenaean language and the [[Cypriot syllabary]], and eventually the dialects of [[Ancient Greek]], of which [[Attic Greek]] bears the most resemblance to [[Modern Greek]]. The history of the language spans over 3400 years of written records.\n\nGreek has had enormous impact on other languages both directly on the [[Romance languages]], and indirectly through its influence on the emerging [[Latin]] language during the early days of [[Rome]]. Signs of this influence, and its many developments, can be seen throughout the family of Western European languages.\n\n=== Internet and \"Greeklish\" ===\n\nMore recently, the rise of internet-based communication services as well as cell phones have caused a distinctive form of Greek written partially, and sometimes fully in Latin characters to emerge; this is known as [[Greeklish]], a form that has spread across the Greek diaspora and even to the two countries with majority Greek population, [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]].\n\n=== Katharevousa ===\n{{Main|Katharevousa}}\n\nKathar\u00e9vousa (\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1) is a form of the Greek Language midway between modern and ancient forms set in train during the early nineteenth century by Greek intellectual and revolutionary leader [[Adamantios Korais]], intended to return the Greek language closer to its ancient form. Its influence, in recent years, evolved toward a more formal role, and it came to be used primarily for official purposes such as diplomacy, politics, and other forms of official documentation. It has nevertheless had significant effects on the Greek language as it is still written and spoken today, and both vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical forms have re-entered [[Modern Greek]] via Katharevousa.\n\n=== Dialects ===\nThere are a variety of dialects of the Greek language; the most notable include [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]], [[Cretan dialect|Cretan Greek]] (which is closely related to most [[Aegean Islands]]' dialects), [[Cypriot Greek]], [[Pontic Greek]], the [[Griko language]] spoken in Southern Italy, and [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]], still spoken in the modern prefecture of [[Arcadia]] and widely noted as a surviving regional dialect of [[Doric Greek]].\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Greek literature}}\n[[File:Homer British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Idealized portrait of [[Homer]], [[British Museum]]]]\n\nGreece has a remarkably rich and resilient literary tradition, extending over 2800 years and through several eras. The Classical era is that most commonly associated with [[Greek Literature]], beginning in 800 BCE and maintaining its influence through to the beginnings of [[Byzantine]] period, whereafter the influence of Christianity began to spawn a new development of the Greek written word. The many elements of a millennia-old tradition are reflected in Modern Greek literature, including the works of the Nobel laureates [[Odysseus Elytis]] and [[George Seferis]].\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\n\nThe first recorded works in the western literary tradition are the [[epic poetry|epic]] poems of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. Early Greek [[lyric poetry]], as represented by poets such as [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]], was responsible for defining the lyric [[genre]] as it is understood today in western literature. [[Aesop]] wrote his ''[[Fables]]'' in the 6th century BC. These innovations were to have a profound influence not only on Roman poets, most notably [[Virgil]] in his epic poem on the founding of Rome, ''[[The Aeneid]]'', but one that flourished throughout Europe.\n\nClassical Greece is also judged the birthplace of [[theatre]]. [[Aeschylus]] introduced the ideas of [[dialogue]] and interacting characters to playwriting and in doing so, he effectively invented \"drama\": his ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy of plays is judged his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. [[Aristophanes]], a comic playwright, defined and shaped the idea of [[comedy]] as a theatrical form.\n\n[[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are often attributed with developing the modern study of [[history]] into a field worthy of philosophical, literary, and scientific pursuit. [[Polybius]] first introduced into study the concept of [[Military|military history]].\n\n[[Philosophy]] entered literature in the dialogues of [[Plato]], while his pupil [[Aristotle]], in his work the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', formulated the first set criteria for [[literary criticism]]. Both these literary figures, in the context of the broader contributions of Greek philosophy in the Classical and Hellenistic eras, were to give rise to idea of [[political Science]], the study of political evolution and the critique of governmental systems.\n\n=== Byzantine Greece ===\n{{Main|Byzantine literature}}\n[[File:Suda.jpg|thumb|160px|A page from a 16th-century edition of the 10th century Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]] of the ancient Mediterranean world, the [[Suda]].]]\n\nThe growth of Christianity throughout the [[Greco-Roman]] world in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, together with the Hellenization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the period, would lead to the formation of a unique literary form, combining Christian, Greek, Roman and Oriental  influences. In its turn, this would promote developments such as Cretan poetry, the growth of poetic satire in the [[Greek East]] and the several pre-eminent historians of the period.\n\n=== Modern Greece ===\n{{Main|Modern Greek literature}}\n[[File:Adamantios Korais.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Adamantios Korais]], major figure of the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment]]]]\n\nModern Greek literature refers to literature written in the [[Greek language]] from the 11th century, with texts written in a language that is more familiar to the ears of [[Greeks]] today than is the language of the early Byzantine times.\n\n[[File:Nikos Kazantzakis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Nikos Kazantzakis]], one of the most prominent modern Greek writers]]\n\nThe [[Cretan Renaissance]] poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this early period of modern Greek literature, and represents one of its supreme achievements. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553\u20131613). The other major representative of the [[Cretan literature]] was [[Georgios Chortatzis]] and his most notable work was ''[[Erofili]]''. Other plays include ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros|Kornaros]], ''Panoria'' and ''Katsourbos'' by [[Georgios Chortatzis|Chortatzis]], ''[[King Rodolinos]]'' by [[Andreas Troilos]], ''Stathis (comedy)'' and ''Voskopoula'' by unknown artists.\n\nMuch later, [[Diafotismos]] was an ideological, philological, linguistic and philosophical movement among 18th century Greeks that translate the ideas and values of [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] into the Greek world. [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] are two of the most notable figures. In 1819, ''[[Korakistika]]'', written by [[Iakovakis Rizos Neroulos]], was a [[parody|lampoon]] against the Greek intellectual [[Adamantios Korais]] and his linguistic views, who favoured the use of a more conservative form of the Greek language, closer to the ancient.\n\nThe years before the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the [[Ionian islands]] became the center of the [[Heptanese School (literature)]]. Its main characteristics was the Italian influence, romanticism, nationalism and use of [[Demotic Greek]]. Notable representatives were [[Andreas Laskaratos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Aristotelis Valaoritis]] and [[Dionysios Solomos]].\n\nAfter the independence the intellectual center was transferred in [[Athens]]. A major figure of this new era was [[Kostis Palamas]], considered \"national poet\" of Greece. He was the central figure of the Greek literary generation of the 1880s and one of the cofounders of the so-called [[New Athenian School]] (or Palamian School). Its main characteristic was the use of [[Demotic Greek]]. He was also the writer of the [[Olympic Hymn]].\n\nMoving into the twentieth century, the modern Greek literary tradition spans the work of [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], considered a key figure of twentieth-century poetry, [[Giorgos Seferis]] (whose works and poems aimed to fuse the literature of Ancient and Modern Greece) and [[Odysseas Elytis]], both of whom won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] is also considered a dominant figure, with works such as ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' and ''[[The Greek Passion]]'' receiving international recognition.\n\n== Philosophy, science and mathematics ==\nThe [[Greek world]] is widely regarded as having given birth to scientific thought by means of observation, thought, and development of a theory without the intervention of a supernatural force. [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]] and [[Democritus]] were amongst those contributing significantly to the establishment of this tradition. It is also, and perhaps more commonly in the western imagination, identified with the dawn of [[Western philosophy]], as well as a mapping out of the [[natural science]]s. Greek developments of mathematics continued well up until the decline of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the modern era Greeks continue to contribute to the fields of [[science]], [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]].\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\n{{see also|Greek mathematics|Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek medicine}}\n[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric system]], in the 3rd century BC]]\n\nThe tradition of [[philosophy]] in ancient Greece accompanied its literary development. Greek learning had a profound influence on [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Middle East]]ern civilizations. The works of [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek philosophers profoundly influenced [[Classical civilization|Classical]] thought, the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and the [[Renaissance]].\n\nIn [[medicine]], doctors still refer to the [[Hippocratic oath]], instituted by [[Hippocrates]], regarded as foremost in laying the foundations of medicine as a science. [[Galen]] built on Hippocrates' theory of the [[Humorism|four humours]], and his writings became the foundation of medicine in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] for centuries. The physicians [[Herophilos]] and [[Paulus Aegineta]] were pioneers in the study of [[anatomy]], while [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] wrote an extensive treatise on the practice of [[pharmacology]].\n\nThe period of [[Classical Greece]] (from 800BC until the rise of [[Macedon]], a Greek state in the north) is that most often associated with Greek advances in science. [[Thales of Miletus]] is regarded by many as the father of [[science]]; he was the first of the ancient philosophers to seek to explain the physical world in terms of natural rather than [[supernatural]] causes. [[Pythagoras]] was a [[mathematician]] often described as the \"father of numbers\"; it is believed that he had the pioneering insight into the numerical ratios that determine the [[musical scale]], and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is commonly attributed to him. [[Diophantus|Diophantus of Alexandria]], in turn, was the \"father of [[algebra]]\". Many parts of modern [[geometry]] are based on the work of [[Euclid]], while [[Eratosthenes]] was one of the first scientific [[geographer]]s, calculating the [[circumference]] of the [[earth]] and conceiving the first [[maps]] based on scientific principles.\n\nThe Hellenistic period, following Alexander's conquests, continued and built upon this knowledge. [[Hipparchus]] is considered the pre-eminent astronomical observer of the ancient world, and was probably the first to develop an accurate method for the prediction of [[solar eclipse]], while [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known [[astronomer]] to propose a [[heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]], though the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]] was more commonly accepted until the seventeenth century. Ptolemy also contributed substantially to [[cartography]] and to the science of [[optics]]. For his part [[Archimedes]] was the first to calculate the value of [[pi|''\u03c0'']] and a [[geometric series]], and also the earliest known mathematical [[physicist]] discovering the law of [[buoyancy]], as well as conceiving the [[irrigation]] device known as [[Archimedes' screw]].\n\n=== Byzantine Greece ===\n{{See also|Byzantine science|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\n[[File:Manuel Chrysoloras - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Manuel Chrysoloras]], [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholar in the Renaissance]]]]\n[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli, Pletone, Cappella dei Magi.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Gemistus Pletho]]]]\n\nThe Byzantine period remained largely a period of preservation in terms of classical Greco-Roman texts; there were, however, significant advances made in the fields of [[Byzantine Medicine|medicine]] and [[History|historical scholarship]]. Theological [[philosophy]] also remained an area of study, and there was, while not matching the achievements of preceding ages, a certain increase in the professionalism of study of these subjects, epitomized by the founding of the University of Constantinople.\n\nIsidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles, the architects of the famous [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], also contributed towards mathematical theories concerning architectural form, and the perceived mathematical harmony needed to create a multi-domed structure. These ideas were to prove a heavy influence on the Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] in his creation of the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]], also in Constantinople. Tralles in particular produced several treatises on the [[Natural Sciences]], as well as his other forays into mathematics such as [[Conic Sections]].\n\nThe gradual migration of Greeks from Byzantium to the [[Italian city-states|Italian]] city states following the decline of the Byzantine Empire, and the texts they brought with them combined with the academic positions they held, was a major factor in lighting the first sparks of the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n\n=== Modern Greece ===\n[[File:Caratheodory constantin.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]], who introduced several [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (disambiguation)|mathematical theorems]].]]\n\nGreeks continue to contribute to science and technology in the modern world. [[John Argyris]], a mathematician and engineer, was among the creators of the [[finite element method]] and the [[direct stiffness method]]. [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] made significant contributions to the [[Real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], [[calculus of variations]] and [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], credited with the introduction of several [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (disambiguation)|mathematical theorems]]. In physics, [[John Iliopoulos]] is known for the prediction of the [[charm quark]] and the proposition of the [[GIM mechanism]], as well as the [[Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos D-term]] formula, while [[Dimitri Nanopoulos]] is one of the principal developers of the [[Flipped SU(5)]] model.\n\nBiologist [[Fotis Kafatos]] pioneers in the field of molecular [[cloning]] and [[genomics]], and he was the founding president of the [[European Research Council]]. In medicine, [[Georgios Papanikolaou]] contributed heavily to the development of [[cervical screening]] inventing the [[Pap test]], which is among the most common methods of cervical screening worldwide.\n\nCar designer [[Alec Issigonis]] designed the groundbreaking and iconic [[Mini]] automobile, while [[Michael Dertouzos]] was amongst the pioneers of the [[Internet]], instrumental in defining the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] and director for 27 years of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], which innovated in a variety of areas during his term. [[Nicholas Negroponte]], is the founder of the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the [[One Laptop per Child]] project aiming to extend Internet access in the [[Developing country|developing world]]. [[Joseph Sifakis]], a computer scientist, has won a [[Turing Award]] for his pioneering work on [[model checking]].\n\n== Politics ==\n{{Main|Politics of Greece}}\n[[Image:Athens Parliament 4-2004.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The building of the [[Hellenic Parliament]], the [[Old Royal Palace]] of [[Otto of Greece]].]]\n\nGreece is a [[Parliament]]ary [[Republic]] with a president assuming a more ceremonial role than in some other republics, and the Prime Minister chosen from the leader of the majority party in the parliament. Greece has a codified [[constitution]] and a written Bill of Rights embedded within it. The current Prime Minister is [[Alexis Tsipras]].\n\nThe politics of the third [[Hellenic Republic]] have been dominated by two main political parties, the self-proclaimed socialists of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] and the conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]. Until recently{{when|date=January 2011}} PASOK had dominated the political scene, presiding over favourable growth rates economically but in the eyes of critics failing to deliver where unemployment and structural issues such as market liberalization were concerned.\n\nNew Democracy's election to government in 2004 has led to various initiatives to modernize the country, such as the education university scheme above as well as labour market liberalization. Politically there has been massive opposition to some of these moves owing to a large, well organized workers' movement in Greece, which distrusts the right wing administration and neo-liberal ideas. The population in general appears to accept many of the initiatives, reflected in governmental support; on the economic front many are so far warming to the reforms made by the administration, which have been largely rewarded with above average Eurozone growth rates. New Democracy were re-elected in September 2007.\n\nA number of other smaller political parties exist. They include the third largest party (''the Communist Party''), which still commands large support from many rural working areas as well as some of the immigrant population in Greece, as well as the far-right ''Popular Orthodox Rally'', with the latter, while commanding a mere three and a half per cent of votes, seeking to capitalise on opposition in some quarters regarding Turkey's EU accession and any tension in the Aegean. There is also a relatively small, but well organized anarchist movement, though its status in Greece has been somewhat exaggerated by media overseas.\n\nThe political process is energetically and openly participated in by the people of Greece, while public demonstrations are a continual feature of Athenian life; however, there have been criticisms of a governmental failure to sufficiently involve minorities in political debate and hence a sidelining of their opinions. In general, politics is regarded as an acceptable subject to broach on almost every social occasion, and Greeks are often very vocal about their support (or lack of it) for certain policy proposals, or political parties themselves&nbsp;\u2013 this is perhaps reflected in what many consider the rather sensationalist [[Mass media|media]] on both sides of the political spectrum; although this is a feature of most European tabloids.\n\n== Public holidays and festivals ==\n{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}\n\nAccording to Greek Law every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. In addition, there are four obligatory, official public holidays: March 25 (''Greek Independence Day''), [[Easter Monday]], August 15 (''Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin'') and December 25 (''[[Christmas]]''). Two more days, May 1 (''[[Labour Day]]'') and October 28 (''[[Ohi Day]]''), are regulated by law as optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed National Holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven National Holidays each year.\n\nIn addition to the National Holidays, there Public Holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a \"Patron Saint\", also called \"Name Day\", or a \"Liberation Day\", and at this day is customary for schools to have a day off.\n\nNotable festivals include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]],<ref>[http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586 Thessaloniki International Film Festival&nbsp;\u2013 Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090357/http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586 |date=2015-09-05 }} (in Greek)</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Religion in Greece|Eastern Orthodox Church}}\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\n[[File:Temple of Hephaestus.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Athens]] is the best-preserved of all ancient Greek temples.]]\n\nClassical Athens may be suggested to have heralded some of the same religious ideas that would later be promoted by [[Christianity]], such as [[Aristotle]]'s invocation of a perfect God, and [[Heraclitus]]' [[Logos]]. [[Plato]] considered there were rewards for the virtuous in the heavens and punishment for the wicked under the earth; the soul was valued more highly than the material body, and the material world was understood to be imperfect and not fully real (illustrated in [[Socrates]]'s [[allegory of the cave]]).\n\n=== Hellenistic Greece ===\n\n[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests spread classical concepts about the divine, the [[afterlife]], and much else across the eastern Mediterranean area. [[Jews]] and [[early Christians]] alike adopted the name \"[[hades]]\" when writing about \"[[sheol]]\" in Greek. [[Greco-Buddhism]] was the cultural [[syncretism]] between [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] and [[Buddhism]], which developed in the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]s. By the advent of [[Christianity]], the four original [[Pentarchy|patriarchates]] beyond Rome used Greek as their church language.\n\n=== Byzantine and Modern Greece ===\n[[File:Panagia Tinos.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Our Lady of Tinos]]'', the major Marian shrine in Greece]]\n[[File:Broken vases on Holy Saturday in Corfu.jpg|thumb|180px|Shards of pottery vases on the street, after being thrown from the windows of nearby houses. A [[Holy Saturday]] tradition in [[Corfu]].]]\n\nThe [[Greek Orthodox Church]], largely because of the importance of Byzantium in Greek history, as well as its role in the revolution, is a major institution in modern Greece. Its roles in society and larger role in overarching Greek culture are very important; a number of Greeks attend Church at least once a month or more and the Orthodox [[Easter]] holiday holds special significance.\n\nThe [[Church of Greece]] also retains limited political influence through the fact the Greek constitution does not have an explicit separation of Church and State; a debate suggested by more conservative elements of the church in the early 2000s about identification cards and whether religious affiliation might be added to them highlights the friction between state and church on some issues; the proposal unsurprisingly was not accepted. A widely publicised set of corruption scandals in 2004 implicating a small group of senior churchmen also increased national debate on introducing a greater transparency to the church-state relationship.\n\nGreek Orthodox Churches dot both the villages and towns of Greece and come in a variety of architectural forms, from older Byzantine churches, to more modern white brick churches, to newer cathedral-like structures with evident Byzantine influence. Greece (as well as Cyprus), also polled as, ostensibly, one of the most religious countries in [[Europe]], according to [[Eurostat]]; however, while the church has wide respect as a moral and cultural institution, a contrast in religious belief with Protestant northern Europe is more obvious than one with Catholic Mediterranean Europe.\n\nGreece also has a significant minority of [[Islam|Muslims]] in [[Eastern Thrace]] (numbering around 100\u2013150,000), with their places of worship guaranteed since the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. The Greek state has fully approved the construction a main mosque for the more recent Muslim community of [[Athens]] under the [[freedom of religion]] provisions of the Greek constitution.\n\nOther religious communities living in Greece include [[Roman Catholicism in Greece|Roman Catholics]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses in Greece|Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Protestantism in Greece|Protestants]], [[Armenians in Greece|Armenians]], followers of the ancient Greek religion (see [[Hellenism (religion)]]), [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jews]] and others.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Athens archery.jpg|thumb|200px|Archery matches in [[Panathenaic Stadium]] during the 2004 Olympics.]]\n\n[[Greece]] has risen to prominence in a number of [[sports|sporting areas]] in recent decades. [[Association football|Football]] in particular has seen a rapid transformation, with the [[Greece national football team|Greek national football team]] winning the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship]]. Many Greek athletes have also achieved significant success and have won world and olympic titles in numerous sports during the years, such as [[basketball]], [[wrestling]], [[water polo]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], with many of them becoming international stars inside their sports. The successful organisation of the [[Athens 2004|Athens 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games]] led also to the further development of many sports and has led to the creation of many World class sport venues all over Greece and especially in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. Greek athletes have won a total 146 medals for Greece in 15 different [[Olympic sports]] at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], including the [[Intercalated Games]], an achievement which makes Greece one of the top nations globally, in the world's rankings of medals per capita.\n\n== Symbols ==\n[[File:Greek Independence 1821.svg|thumb|200px|Traditional flag used from 1769 to the War of Independence]]\n\nThe [[national colours of Greece]] are blue and white. The [[coat of arms of Greece]] consists of a white cross on a blue [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] which is surrounded by two [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branches.{{sfn|\u0395\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2|1975|p=Article 2}} The [[Flag of Greece]] is also blue and white, as defined by Law 851/1978 ''Regarding the National Flag''.{{sfn|Law 851/1978|p=Article 1, Clause 1}} It specifies the colour of \"cyan\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc, ''kyano''), meaning \"blue\", so the shade of blue is ambiguous.\n\nThe [[Order of the Redeemer]] and military decoration [[Cross of Valour (Greece)|Cross of Valour]] both have ribbons in the national colours.{{sfn|Presidency of the Hellenic Republic: The Order of the Redeemer}}\n\nSince it was first established, the national emblem has undergone many changes in shape and in design. The original Greek national emblem depicted the goddess [[Athena]] and an [[owl]]. At the time of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the symbol of rebirth, was added.\n\nOther recognizable symbols include the (throughout the [[Byzantine empire]]) [[double-headed eagle]] and the [[Vergina Sun]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Art in modern Greece]]\n* [[Hellenistic period]]\n* [[Hellenic Foundation for Culture]]\n* [[Center for the Greek Language]]\n* [[Cinema of Cyprus]]\n* [[List of Greek films]]\n* [[Education in Greece]]\n* [[List of universities in Greece]]\n* [[Greek Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Syncretism#Ancient Greece|Syncretism in Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Paideia]]\n* [[Gaida]]\n* [[Hellenization]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Bruce Thornton]], ''Greek Ways: How the Greeks Created Western Civilization'', Encounter Books, 2002\n*{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Laurie Kain|title=Culture, Civilization, and Demarcation at the Northwest Borders of Greece|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=26|issue=1|year=1999|pages=196\u2013220|issn=0094-0496|doi=10.1525/ae.1999.26.1.196}}\n* [[Simon Goldhill]], ''Who Needs Greek?: Contests in the Cultural History of Hellenism'', Cambridge University Press, 2002\n* [[Victor Davis Hanson]], John Heath, ''Who Killed Homer: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom'', Encounter Books, 2001\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.hellenism.net Hellenism Network - Greek Culture]\n* [http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/history-of-ancient-greece-22-literature.asp ''Sketch of the History of Greek Literature from the Earliest Times to the Reign of Alexander the Great'' by William Smith]\n* [http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?pageID=106&la=eng ''Anagnosis Books Modern Greek Culture Pages'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050629084248/http://www.adath-shalom.ca/greek_influence.htm The Impact of Greek Culture on Normative Judaism from the Hellenistic Period through the Middle Ages c. 330 BCE- 1250 CE]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060713074229/http://www.seve.gr/sevedetrop/defaulten.htm The Greek diet and its relationship to health]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203235624/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/greece/index.html Greece a cultural profile]\n\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Culture of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culture Of Greece}}\n[[Category:Greek culture| ]]\n[[Category:Indo-European culture|Greek]]\n", "name_user": "Greco22", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eModern Greece", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Greece"}
