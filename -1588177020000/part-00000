The festival was first held at [[Montreux Casino]]. The driving force is the tourism office under the direction of [https://neu.nationalmuseum.ch/sharedObjects/01_Zuerich/02_Ausstellungen/2018/Montreux/Schulen/Ausstellungstexte_D.pdf Raymond Jaussi.] It lasted for three days and featured almost exclusively jazz artists. The highlights of this era were [[Charles Lloyd (jazz musician)|Charles Lloyd]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Soft Machine]], [[Weather Report]], [[The Fourth Way (band)|The Fourth Way]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Jan Garbarek]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]].\n\nOriginally a pure [[jazz]] festival, it opened up in the 1970s and today presents artists of nearly every imaginable music style. Jazz remains an important part of the festival. Part of the festival's expansion was due to coproduction by [[Quincy Jones]] who brought many international artists in the early 1990s. Today's festival lasts about two weeks and attracts an audience of more than 200,000 people.\n\nIn the 1970s, the festival began broadening its scope, including [[blues]], [[Soul music|soul]], and rock artists, for instance [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Canned Heat]] and many others. Towards the end of the decade, the festival expanded even more, including music from all continents (with an emphasis on [[Brazilian music]]) and lasting a full three weeks. [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] came to Montreux for the first time in 1970; [[Van Morrison]] played in 1974 and 1980. Other artists included [[B.B. King]], [[Gary Moore]], [[Weather Report]], [[Don Ellis]], [[Crossfire (band)|Crossfire]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]], [[Soft Machine]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Luther Allison]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Airto Moreira]], [[Joe Henderson]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Ney Matogrosso]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Etta James]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Son House]], [[Count Basie]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Ray Charles]], [[James Booker]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]], [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Elis Regina]], [[Les McCann]], [[Eddie Harris]], [[Pasadena Roof Orchestra]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Zucchero Fornaciari]], [[Andr\u00e9 Geraissati]], [[Korni Grupa]], [[Jan Akkerman]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], and many more.\n\nThe initiator and, until his tragic death in 2013, the head organizer, [[Claude Nobs]], managed to bring an array of artists to Montreux, both established ones and newcomers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs|url=http://www.montreuxjazz.com:80/2011/en/festival/claude_nobs|publisher=Montreux Jazz Festival|accessdate=16 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102155133/http://www.montreuxjazz.com/2011/en/festival/claude_nobs|archivedate=2 November 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following Claude's death, the organisation of the festival was handed over to Mathieu Jaton.\nMain partners of the Festival are [[Parmigiani Fleurier]], Manor, [[Heineken]], Vaudoise Assurances and [[UBS]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Montreux Jazz Festival|url=https://www.montreuxjazzfestival.com|publisher=Montreux Jazz Festival|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Venue==\nThe festival was originally held at the original [[Montreux Casino]], which burned down in December 1971 during [[Frank Zappa]]'s performance (as referenced in \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\" by [[Deep Purple]]).\nThe festival was held then in other auditoriums in Montreux, until it could return to the rebuilt new Casino in 1975. The festival continued to grow, and in 1993, it moved to the larger [[Montreux Convention Centre]]. From 1995 through 2008, it occupied both the convention centre and the casino. Beginning with the 41st MJF in 2007, nightly performances of headliners were again moved mainly to the Montreux Musique & Convention Centre (though the Casino still hosts the odd one-off shows), owing mainly to logistics: the Casino is approximately {{convert|1|km|yd}} from the Convention Centre, making it difficult for crew, artists and technical personnel (as well as fans) to travel easily through crowded streets from one venue to the other. (This is exacerbated by the presence of a large number of streetside vendors and artisans \u2013 as well as strolling crowds of tourists \u2013 on the lakefront walk that connects the venues.) As of 2007, the Convention Centre hosts two main stages, Auditorium Stravinski (capacity 3,500) and Miles Davis Hall (capacity 1,800), as well as the smaller Montreux Jazz Cafe, and several smaller open-air stages around the Centre. Additional themed shows (Bahia, Blues, etc.) are held on boats cruising the lake and train cars traveling the region, and various workshops and competitions are held at the nearby Montreux Palais and Le Petit Palais.\n\n===Venue history===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ '''Venue history'''\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n|16\u201318 June 1967\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[Montreux Casino]]\n|-\n|12\u201316 June 1968\n|-\n|18\u201322 June 1969\n|-\n|17\u201321 June 1970\n|-\n|12\u201320 June 1971\n|-\n|16\u201329 June 1972\n|Pavillon Montreux\n|-\n|29&nbsp;June{{snd}}15&nbsp;July 1973\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Montreux Convention Centre]]\n|-\n|28 June{{snd}}7 July 1974\n|-\n|3\u201320 July 1975\n|rowspan=\"18\"|Montreux Casino\n|-\n|25&nbsp;June{{snd}}6&nbsp;July 1976\n|-\n|1\u201324 July 1977\n|-\n|7\u201323 July 1978\n|-\n|6\u201322 July 1979\n|-\n|4\u201320 July 1980\n|-\n|3\u201320 July 1981\n|-\n|9\u201325 July 1982\n|-\n|8\u201324 July 1983\n|-\n|6\u201322 July 1984\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 1985\n|-\n|3\u201319 July 1986\n|-\n|3\u201317 July 1987\n|-\n|1\u201317 July 1988\n|-\n|7\u201322 July 1989\n|-\n|6\u201321 July 1990\n|-\n|9\u201329 July 1991\n|-\n|10\u201322 July 1992\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 1993\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/The New Q's)</small>\n|-\n|1\u201316 July 1994\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small>\n|-\n|7\u201322 July 1995\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Casino<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 1996\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 1997\n|-\n|3\u201318 July 1998\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 1999\n|-\n|7\u201322 July 2000\n|-\n|6\u201321 July 2001\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Casino<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Sc\u00e8ne Bleu\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 2002\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Casino<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 2003\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Casino Barri\u00e8re de Montreux<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 2004\n|-\n|1\u201316 July 2005\n|-\n|30&nbsp;June{{snd}}15&nbsp;July 2006\n|-\n|6\u201321 July 2007\n|Montreux Musique & Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 2008\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Montreux Musique & Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club<br>MDH Club<br>Studio 41<br>Music in the Park\n|-\n|3\u201318 July 2009\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 2010\n|-\n|1\u201316 July 2011\n|-\n|29&nbsp;June{{snd}}14&nbsp;July 2012\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 2013\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Montreux Musique & Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club<br>MDH Club<br>Studio 41<br>Music in the Park<br>Montreux Jazz Lab\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 2014\n|-\n|3-18 July 2015\n|-\n|1-16 July 2016\n|-\n|30 June-15 July 2017\n|-\n|29 June-14 July 2018\n|}\n\n== Expansion ==\n\nThe festival changed in the 1980s: it grew dramatically and included an even wider variety of music styles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kirellbenzi.com/blog/evolution-of-genres-in-the-montreux-jazz-festival/|title=Evolution of genres in the Montreux Jazz Festival|date=2016-07-29|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref> Jazz remained important, as did Brazilian music, but more rock and pop artists were also invited.\n\n[[Miles Davis]] came to Montreux several times, British hard rock band [[Deep Purple]] were invited as headliners eight times, and [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] have headlined the festival twice. Other notable artists at Montreux were [[Sandra (singer)|Sandra]] [[Max Roach]], [[James Brown]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Art Blakey]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Mike Oldfield]], [[Brian May]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Los Lobos]], [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Tracy Chapman]], and [[Van Morrison]] again.\n\nThe expansion that began in the 1980s has continued since then \u2013 Montreux transformed from a jazz festival into a world music festival. [[Quincy Jones]] co-produced the festival from 1991 to 1993. By 1993, the festival had outgrown the Casino and moved to the larger Convention Centre. The number of visitors rose from 75,000 in 1980 to 120,000 in 1994, and an \"Off-festival\" developed on the lakeshore promenades and in the caf\u00e9s of Montreux.\n\nMany \"regulars\" returned, but many new artists also appeared on stage: [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Cheb Mami]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Ice-T]], [[Guru (rapper)|Jazzmatazz]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Simply Red]], [[Marisa Monte]], [[George Benson]], [[Jazzkantine]], [[Alanis Morissette]], [[David Bowie]], [[Paul Simon]]. In 1999, the festival saw more than 220,000 visitors.\n\nThe festival has also played host to some well-known and talented student groups, including big bands and vocal ensembles. Young, talented musicians are encouraged to take part in several competitions.\n\n==Competitions==\nThree international competitions are organised by the Montreux Jazz Artists Foundation<ref name=mjaf>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjaf.ch/en|title=Montreux Jazz Artists Foundation|accessdate=2016-10-24}}</ref> every year: Solo Piano, Guitar, and Voice. Each competition has its own jury composed of professionals and chaired by a world-renowned musician (in 2008: [[Faz\u0131l Say]] for the Piano Solo, [[Lee Ritenour]] for the Guitar, [[Patti Austin]] for the Voice competition). In addition, until 2016, a local competition, the Tremplin L\u00e9manique, was aimed at jazz bands that are based in one of the regions of the [[L\u00e9man lake]]: the French departments of Ain and Haute Savoie and the Swiss cantons of Geneva, Vaud and Valais.<ref>http://www.patrimoine.vd.ch/traditions-vivantes/arts-du-spectacle/festivals/montreux-jazz-festival/</ref>\n\n==Performances==\n{{Main article|List of performers at the Montreux Jazz Festival}}\n\nOver 1300 artists have performed at the Festival from 1967 to 2016, with the most appearances by [[Herbie Hancock]] (27 times) and [[B.B.

It is the second largest annual jazz festival in the world after Canada's [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mutter|first1=Zoe|title=Meyer Sound LEOPARD takes to the Montreux jazz stages|url=http://www.avinteractive.com/news/audio/meyer-sound-leopard-takes-to-the-montreux-jazz-stages-06-07-2015/|accessdate=16 May 2017|work=AV Magazine|publisher=Metropolis Business Media|date=6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Montreux Jazz Festival opened on June 18, 1967 and was founded by [[Claude Nobs]], [[G\u00e9o Voumard]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Langel]]<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |title=G\u00e9o Voumard, a Founder of the Montreux Jazz Festival, Dies at 87 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/arts/music/05voumard.html|agency=Agence France-Presse   |work=New York Times|date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=11 September 2008}}</ref> with considerable help from [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn|Ahmet]] and [[Nesuhi Erteg\u00fcn]] of [[Atlantic Records]]. The festival was first held at [[Montreux Casino]]. The driving force is the tourism office under the direction of [https://neu.nationalmuseum.ch/sharedObjects/01_Zuerich/02_Ausstellungen/2018/Montreux/Schulen/Ausstellungstexte_D.pdf Raymond Jaussi.] It lasted for three days and featured almost exclusively jazz artists. The highlights of this era were [[Charles Lloyd (jazz musician)|Charles Lloyd]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Soft Machine]], [[Weather Report]], [[The Fourth Way (band)|The Fourth Way]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Jan Garbarek]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]].\n\nOriginally a pure [[jazz]] festival, it opened up in the 1970s and today presents artists of nearly every imaginable music style. Jazz remains an important part of the festival. Part of the festival's expansion was due to coproduction by [[Quincy Jones]] who brought many international artists in the early 1990s. Today's festival lasts about two weeks and attracts an audience of more than 200,000 people.\n\nIn the 1970s, the festival began broadening its scope, including [[blues]], [[Soul music|soul]], and rock artists, for instance [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Canned Heat]] and many others. Towards the end of the decade, the festival expanded even more, including music from all continents (with an emphasis on [[Brazilian music]]) and lasting a full three weeks. [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] came to Montreux for the first time in 1970; [[Van Morrison]] played in 1974 and 1980. Other artists included [[B.B. King]], [[Gary Moore]], [[Weather Report]], [[Don Ellis]], [[Crossfire (band)|Crossfire]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]], [[Soft Machine]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Luther Allison]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Airto Moreira]], [[Joe Henderson]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Ney Matogrosso]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Etta James]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Son House]], [[Count Basie]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Ray Charles]], [[James Booker]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]], [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Elis Regina]], [[Les McCann]], [[Eddie Harris]], [[Pasadena Roof Orchestra]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Zucchero Fornaciari]], [[Andr\u00e9 Geraissati]], [[Korni Grupa]], [[Jan Akkerman]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], and many more.\n\nThe initiator and, until his tragic death in 2013, the head organizer, [[Claude Nobs]], managed to bring an array of artists to Montreux, both established ones and newcomers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs|url=http://www.montreuxjazz.com:80/2011/en/festival/claude_nobs|publisher=Montreux Jazz Festival|accessdate=16 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102155133/http://www.montreuxjazz.com/2011/en/festival/claude_nobs|archivedate=2 November 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following Claude's death, the organisation of the festival was handed over to Mathieu Jaton.\nMain partners of the Festival are [[Parmigiani Fleurier]], Manor, [[Heineken]], Vaudoise Assurances and [[UBS]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Montreux Jazz Festival|url=https://www.montreuxjazzfestival.com|publisher=Montreux Jazz Festival|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Venue==\nThe festival was originally held at the original [[Montreux Casino]], which burned down in December 1971 during [[Frank Zappa]]'s performance (as referenced in \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\" by [[Deep Purple]]).\nThe festival was held then in other auditoriums in Montreux, until it could return to the rebuilt new Casino in 1975. The festival continued to grow, and in 1993, it moved to the larger [[Montreux Convention Centre]]. From 1995 through 2008, it occupied both the convention centre and the casino. Beginning with the 41st MJF in 2007, nightly performances of headliners were again moved mainly to the Montreux Musique & Convention Centre (though the Casino still hosts the odd one-off shows), owing mainly to logistics: the Casino is approximately {{convert|1|km|yd}} from the Convention Centre, making it difficult for crew, artists and technical personnel (as well as fans) to travel easily through crowded streets from one venue to the other. (This is exacerbated by the presence of a large number of streetside vendors and artisans \u2013 as well as strolling crowds of tourists \u2013 on the lakefront walk that connects the venues.) As of 2007, the Convention Centre hosts two main stages, Auditorium Stravinski (capacity 3,500) and Miles Davis Hall (capacity 1,800), as well as the smaller Montreux Jazz Cafe, and several smaller open-air stages around the Centre. Additional themed shows (Bahia, Blues, etc.) are held on boats cruising the lake and train cars traveling the region, and various workshops and competitions are held at the nearby Montreux Palais and Le Petit Palais.\n\n===Venue history===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ '''Venue history'''\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n|-\n|16\u201318 June 1967\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[Montreux Casino]]\n|-\n|12\u201316 June 1968\n|-\n|18\u201322 June 1969\n|-\n|17\u201321 June 1970\n|-\n|12\u201320 June 1971\n|-\n|16\u201329 June 1972\n|Pavillon Montreux\n|-\n|29&nbsp;June{{snd}}15&nbsp;July 1973\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Montreux Convention Centre]]\n|-\n|28 June{{snd}}7 July 1974\n|-\n|3\u201320 July 1975\n|rowspan=\"18\"|Montreux Casino\n|-\n|25&nbsp;June{{snd}}6&nbsp;July 1976\n|-\n|1\u201324 July 1977\n|-\n|7\u201323 July 1978\n|-\n|6\u201322 July 1979\n|-\n|4\u201320 July 1980\n|-\n|3\u201320 July 1981\n|-\n|9\u201325 July 1982\n|-\n|8\u201324 July 1983\n|-\n|6\u201322 July 1984\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 1985\n|-\n|3\u201319 July 1986\n|-\n|3\u201317 July 1987\n|-\n|1\u201317 July 1988\n|-\n|7\u201322 July 1989\n|-\n|6\u201321 July 1990\n|-\n|9\u201329 July 1991\n|-\n|10\u201322 July 1992\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 1993\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/The New Q's)</small>\n|-\n|1\u201316 July 1994\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small>\n|-\n|7\u201322 July 1995\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Casino<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 1996\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 1997\n|-\n|3\u201318 July 1998\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 1999\n|-\n|7\u201322 July 2000\n|-\n|6\u201321 July 2001\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Casino<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Sc\u00e8ne Bleu\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 2002\n|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Casino<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 2003\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Montreux Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Casino Barri\u00e8re de Montreux<br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 2004\n|-\n|1\u201316 July 2005\n|-\n|30&nbsp;June{{snd}}15&nbsp;July 2006\n|-\n|6\u201321 July 2007\n|Montreux Musique & Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 2008\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Montreux Musique & Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club<br>MDH Club<br>Studio 41<br>Music in the Park\n|-\n|3\u201318 July 2009\n|-\n|2\u201317 July 2010\n|-\n|1\u201316 July 2011\n|-\n|29&nbsp;June{{snd}}14&nbsp;July 2012\n|-\n|5\u201320 July 2013\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Montreux Musique & Convention Centre <br><small>(Auditorium Stravinski/Miles Davis Hall)</small><br>Montreux Jazz Caf\u00e9<br>Montreux Jazz Young Planet<br>Montreux Jazz Club<br>MDH Club<br>Studio 41<br>Music in the Park<br>Montreux Jazz Lab\n|-\n|4\u201319 July 2014\n|-\n|3-18 July 2015\n|-\n|1-16 July 2016\n|-\n|30 June-15 July 2017\n|-\n|29 June-14 July 2018\n|}\n\n== Expansion ==\n\nThe festival changed in the 1980s: it grew dramatically and included an even wider variety of music styles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kirellbenzi.com/blog/evolution-of-genres-in-the-montreux-jazz-festival/|title=Evolution of genres in the Montreux Jazz Festival|date=2016-07-29|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref> Jazz remained important, as did Brazilian music, but more rock and pop artists were also invited.\n\n[[Miles Davis]] came to Montreux several times, British hard rock band [[Deep Purple]] were invited as headliners eight times, and [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] have headlined the festival twice. Other notable artists at Montreux were [[Sandra (singer)|Sandra]] [[Max Roach]], [[James Brown]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Art Blakey]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Mike Oldfield]], [[Brian May]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Los Lobos]], [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Tracy Chapman]], and [[Van Morrison]] again.\n\nThe expansion that began in the 1980s has continued since then \u2013 Montreux transformed from a jazz festival into a world music festival. [[Quincy Jones]] co-produced the festival from 1991 to 1993. By 1993, the festival had outgrown the Casino and moved to the larger Convention Centre. The number of visitors rose from 75,000 in 1980 to 120,000 in 1994, and an \"Off-festival\" developed on the lakeshore promenades and in the caf\u00e9s of Montreux.\n\nMany \"regulars\" returned, but many new artists also appeared on stage: [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Al Jarreau]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Cheb Mami]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Ice-T]], [[Guru (rapper)|Jazzmatazz]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Simply Red]], [[Marisa Monte]], [[George Benson]], [[Jazzkantine]], [[Alanis Morissette]], [[David Bowie]], [[Paul Simon]]. In 1999, the festival saw more than 220,000 visitors.\n\nThe festival has also played host to some well-known and talented student groups, including big bands and vocal ensembles. Young, talented musicians are encouraged to take part in several competitions.\n\n==Competitions==\nThree international competitions are organised by the Montreux Jazz Artists Foundation<ref name=mjaf>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjaf.ch/en|title=Montreux Jazz Artists Foundation|accessdate=2016-10-24}}</ref> every year: Solo Piano, Guitar, and Voice. Each competition has its own jury composed of professionals and chaired by a world-renowned musician (in 2008: [[Faz\u0131l Say]] for the Piano Solo, [[Lee Ritenour]] for the Guitar, [[Patti Austin]] for the Voice competition). In addition, until 2016, a local competition, the Tremplin L\u00e9manique, was aimed at jazz bands that are based in one of the regions of the [[L\u00e9man lake]]: the French departments of Ain and Haute Savoie and the Swiss cantons of Geneva, Vaud and Valais.<ref>http://www.patrimoine.vd.ch/traditions-vivantes/arts-du-spectacle/festivals/montreux-jazz-festival/</ref>\n\n==Performances==\n{{Main article|List of performers at the Montreux Jazz Festival}}\n\nOver 1300 artists have performed at the Festival from 1967 to 2016, with the most appearances by [[Herbie Hancock]] (27 times) and [[B.B.
