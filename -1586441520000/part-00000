Researchers from this laboratory were already involved in the characterization of Mimivirus, the first described giant T2 Virus. Megavirus was isolated by co-cultivation with a variety of ''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' laboratory strains (''[[Acanthamoeba polyphaga|A. polyphaga]]'', ''[[Acanthamoeba castellanii|A. castellanii]]'', ''[[Acanthamoeba griffini|A. griffini]]'') following a protocol pioneered by Dr. Timothy Rowbotham for isolating intracellular parasitic bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=978\u201386 |pmc=498455 |doi=10.1136/jcp.36.9.978 |title=Isolation of Legionella pneumophila from clinical specimens via amoebae, and the interaction of those and other isolates with amoebae |year=1983 |last1=Rowbotham |first1=T J |journal=Journal of Clinical Pathology |volume=36 |issue=9 |pmid=6350372}}</ref> Megavirus infects amoebas.\n\n== Classification ==\nMegavirus is not yet classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]], but will be proposed as a member of the Megaviridae, a new family constituted of the large DNA viruses the genome of which is around a million base pairs in length. Members of this new family defined by a number of common specific features (Table 1 and 2) will include various viruses likely to share a common ancestor with Mimivirus and Megavirus, although their present genome size was reduced below 1 Mb. Megavirus also joins a group of large viruses known as [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]] (NCLDV), although this term appears increasingly inappropriate to designate viruses replicating entirely within the cytoplasm of their hosts through the de novo synthesis of large virion factories. Megavirus and Mimivirus share 594 orthologous genes, mostly located within the center segment of their genomes. At the amino-acid sequence level, the corresponding proteins share an average of 50% identical residues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Megavirus particle exhibits a protein [[capsid]] diameter of 440 [[nanometre]]s (as seen by electron microscopy on thin sections of epoxy resin inclusions), enclosed into a solid mesh of bacterial-like capsular material 75&nbsp;nm to 100&nbsp;nm thick. The capsid appears hexagonal, but its icosahedral symmetry is imperfect, due to the presence of the \u201cstargate\u201d, at a single specific vertex of the icosahedron. The stargate is a five-pronged star structure forming the portal through which the internal core of the particle is delivered to the host's cytoplasm. This core is enclosed within two lipid membranes in the particle, also containing a large and diverse complement of viral proteins (e.g. the all transcriptional complex).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Surprisingly, the Megavirus is larger than some bacteria, particularly the ones it preys on.\n\n== Genome ==\nThe Megavirus chilensis genome is a linear, double-stranded molecule of [[DNA]] with 1,259,197 [[base pairs]] in length. This makes it the second largest viral genome deciphered so far (after [[Pandoravirus|Pandoraviridae]]), outstripping the next-largest virus genome of Mamavirus by 67.5 kb. Prior validation of its transcriptome, it is predicted to encode 1,120 protein-coding genes, a number largely above the one exhibited by many bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nHowever, beyond an incremental change in size, the Megavirus genome exhibits 7 [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetases]] (Table 2), the archetypes of enzymes previously thought only to be encoded by cellular organisms. While 4 of these enzymes were known to be present in Mimivirus and Mamavirus (for tyrosine, arginine, cysteine, and methionine), Megavirus exhibits three more (for tryptophan, asparagine, and isoleucine). The unique aminoacyltRNA synthetase encoded by [[Cafeteria roenbergensis virus]] corresponds to the one for isoleucine. Megavirus also encodes a fused version of the mismatch DNA repair enzyme MutS, uniquely similar to the one found in the mitochondrion of octocorals. This puzzling MutS version appears to be a trademark of the family Megaviridae.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1143\u201351 |doi=10.1038/ismej.2010.210 |pmc=3146287 |title=Two new subfamilies of DNA mismatch repair proteins (MutS) specifically abundant in the marine environment |year=2011 |last1=Ogata |first1=Hiroyuki |last2=Ray |first2=Jessica |last3=Toyoda |first3=Kensuke |last4=Sandaa |first4=Ruth-Anne |last5=Nagasaki |first5=Keizo |last6=Bratbak |first6=Gunnar |last7=Claverie |first7=Jean-Michel |journal=The ISME Journal |volume=5 |issue=7 |pmid=21248859}}</ref> Like Mimivirus and CroV, Megavirus contains many genes for sugar, lipid and amino acid processing, as well as some metabolic genes not found in any other virus.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=431\u20137 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.003 |title=Mimivirus: The emerging paradox of quasi-autonomous viruses |year=2010 |last1=Claverie |first1=Jean-Michel |last2=Abergel |first2=Chantal |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=26 |issue=10 |pmid=20696492}}</ref>\n\n== Replication ==\nMegavirus replication stages closely follows the one already described for Mimivirus. Following rapid engulfing by phagocytosis, and the delivery of the particle core to the cytoplasm, begins the eclipse phase. A closer examination indicates the presence of cytoplasmic \u201cseeds\u201d, of sizes comparable to the most internal membrane-enclosed core of the Megavirus particle. These seeds then develop in full bloomed virion factory over the following 14 hours. The full course of infection (until the complete lysis of the amoebal cells) takes 17 hours on average, compared to 12 hours for Mimivirus. The average number of released Megavirus particles (i.e. the \u201cburst size\u201d) is about 500, half the thousand released by Mimivirus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAs expected from a virus encoding its own complete DNA replication, repair, and transcription machinery, the host nucleus does not appear to be involved in any of Megavirus replication stages, as already seen for Mimivirus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Table 1: Largest giant viruses with complete sequenced genomes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Giant virus name!!Genome Length!!Genes!!Capsid diameter!!Hair cover!!Genbank #\n|-\n|Megavirus chilensis<ref name=\"Doipnas\" />||1,259,197||1120 proteins (predicted)||440&nbsp;nm||75&nbsp;nm||JN258408\n|-\n|Mamavirus<ref>{{cite journal |pages=737\u201342 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evr048 |pmc=3163472 |title=Viruses with More Than 1,000 Genes: Mamavirus, a New Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus Strain, and Reannotation of Mimivirus Genes |year=2011 |last1=Colson |first1=P. |last2=Yutin |first2=N. |last3=Shabalina |first3=S.

Researchers from this laboratory were already involved in the characterization of Mimivirus, the first described giant T2 Virus. Megavirus was isolated by co-cultivation with a variety of ''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' laboratory strains (''[[Acanthamoeba polyphaga|A. polyphaga]]'', ''[[Acanthamoeba castellanii|A. castellanii]]'', ''[[Acanthamoeba griffini|A. griffini]]'') following a protocol pioneered by Dr. Timothy Rowbotham for isolating intracellular parasitic bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=978\u201386 |pmc=498455 |doi=10.1136/jcp.36.9.978 |title=Isolation of Legionella pneumophila from clinical specimens via amoebae, and the interaction of those and other isolates with amoebae |year=1983 |last1=Rowbotham |first1=T J |journal=Journal of Clinical Pathology |volume=36 |issue=9 |pmid=6350372}}</ref> Megavirus infects amoebas.\n\n== Classification ==\nMegavirus is not yet classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]], but will be proposed as a member of the Megaviridae, a new family constituted of the large DNA viruses the genome of which is around a million base pairs in length. Members of this new family defined by a number of common specific features (Table 1 and 2) will include various viruses likely to share a common ancestor with Mimivirus and Megavirus, although their present genome size was reduced below 1 Mb. Megavirus also joins a group of large viruses known as [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]] (NCLDV), although this term appears increasingly inappropriate to designate viruses replicating entirely within the cytoplasm of their hosts through the de novo synthesis of large virion factories. Megavirus and Mimivirus share 594 orthologous genes, mostly located within the center segment of their genomes. At the amino-acid sequence level, the corresponding proteins share an average of 50% identical residues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Megavirus particle exhibits a protein [[capsid]] diameter of 440 [[nanometre]]s (as seen by electron microscopy on thin sections of epoxy resin inclusions), enclosed into a solid mesh of bacterial-like capsular material 75&nbsp;nm to 100&nbsp;nm thick. The capsid appears hexagonal, but its icosahedral symmetry is imperfect, due to the presence of the \u201cstargate\u201d, at a single specific vertex of the icosahedron. The stargate is a five-pronged star structure forming the portal through which the internal core of the particle is delivered to the host's cytoplasm. This core is enclosed within two lipid membranes in the particle, also containing a large and diverse complement of viral proteins (e.g. the all transcriptional complex).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Surprisingly, the Megavirus is larger than some bacteria, particularly the ones it preys on.\n\n== Genome ==\nThe Megavirus chilensis genome is a linear, double-stranded molecule of [[DNA]] with 1,259,197 [[base pairs]] in length. This makes it the second largest viral genome deciphered so far (after [[Pandoravirus|Pandoraviridae]]), outstripping the next-largest virus genome of Mamavirus by 67.5 kb. Prior validation of its transcriptome, it is predicted to encode 1,120 protein-coding genes, a number largely above the one exhibited by many bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nHowever, beyond an incremental change in size, the Megavirus genome exhibits 7 [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetases]] (Table 2), the archetypes of enzymes previously thought only to be encoded by cellular organisms. While 4 of these enzymes were known to be present in Mimivirus and Mamavirus (for tyrosine, arginine, cysteine, and methionine), Megavirus exhibits three more (for tryptophan, asparagine, and isoleucine). The unique aminoacyltRNA synthetase encoded by [[Cafeteria roenbergensis virus]] corresponds to the one for isoleucine. Megavirus also encodes a fused version of the mismatch DNA repair enzyme MutS, uniquely similar to the one found in the mitochondrion of octocorals. This puzzling MutS version appears to be a trademark of the family Megaviridae.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1143\u201351 |doi=10.1038/ismej.2010.210 |pmc=3146287 |title=Two new subfamilies of DNA mismatch repair proteins (MutS) specifically abundant in the marine environment |year=2011 |last1=Ogata |first1=Hiroyuki |last2=Ray |first2=Jessica |last3=Toyoda |first3=Kensuke |last4=Sandaa |first4=Ruth-Anne |last5=Nagasaki |first5=Keizo |last6=Bratbak |first6=Gunnar |last7=Claverie |first7=Jean-Michel |journal=The ISME Journal |volume=5 |issue=7 |pmid=21248859}}</ref> Like Mimivirus and CroV, Megavirus contains many genes for sugar, lipid and amino acid processing, as well as some metabolic genes not found in any other virus.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=431\u20137 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.003 |title=Mimivirus: The emerging paradox of quasi-autonomous viruses |year=2010 |last1=Claverie |first1=Jean-Michel |last2=Abergel |first2=Chantal |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=26 |issue=10 |pmid=20696492}}</ref>\n\n== Replication ==\nMegavirus replication stages closely follows the one already described for Mimivirus.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles' directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column, \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name were not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio.\n\nEven in the released version, ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is often regarded as among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], a distinction it shares with Welles' first film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html |title=100 Greatest Films |publisher=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tim|last=Dirks|url=http://www.filmsite.org/magn.html |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) review |website=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref> The film was nominated for four [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and it was added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1991.\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-7.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joseph Cotten, [[Anne Baxter]], and [[Tim Holt]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-2.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dolores Costello, Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter, Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-5.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Richard Bennett, Agnes Moorehead, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n}}\n[[File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.0|[[:File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|''The Magnificent Ambersons'' trailer]]]]\n\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in the midwestern city of [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], at the beginning of the 20th century. Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles' directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column, \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name were not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

His idea was for the theme of Oddworld to be \"heavily woven with the dark side of globalization, the dark side of the multi-national fallout upon the human condition\" and for his games to touch on examples of those themes, in the case of ''Abe's Oddysee'', capitalism, third-world exploitation, the environment and the fast food industry with respect to the plight of the diamond miners in South Africa and the De Beers cartel that dominate diamond trading.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> Lanning disliked \"what [capitalism] did to the little guy,\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> and \"wanted to create a meaningful dark reflection of our dysfunctional world, wrapped up in a fantasy world, where we could talk about the craziness of our capitalism, but with a funny bone approach.\"<ref name=\"Reddit\" /> And this anti-capitalist view infused the deeper meaning of ''Abe's Oddysee'' as the socio-economic element of the story was set amongst the lower class \"slaving away in unsafe conditions, unwillingly bending to the will of corporate suits... to earn a few bucks for a day's worth of grueling, often unrewarding work\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_oddysee_1 |title=Editorial: Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee |publisher=gog.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> The protagonist fighting back against his oppressors, the Glukkons, represented Lanning's desire for people in the real world to fight back against the \"abominable behavior of the world's most greedy multi-national corporations,\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> characterised by \"caricatures of CEOs, all power-suits and cigars.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sosogay.co.uk/2013/retro-gaymer-oddworld-abes-oddysee/ |title=Retro Gaymer\u2026 Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee |publisher=So So Gay |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530234855/http://sosogay.co.uk/2013/retro-gaymer-oddworld-abes-oddysee/ |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Glukkons play a minor role in the gameplay of ''Abe's Oddysee'', and are only seen in the game's cutscenes. This was intentional, as Lanning wanted the primary antagonist to be the RuptureFarms factory itself. \"The corporation is above and beyond any of its executives or employees\u2014or slaves. So by making [players] defeat RuptureFarms as the end boss... we thought it would add a bigger sense of climax.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> This story was important to Lanning because he feels \"it's the artist's role to create new myths that are relevant to the changing times of our world, [and] to bring some shining direction to our more troubling challenges.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" />\n\nThe game introduced what would become staple features of Oddworld games. In an era of gaming when protagonists were typically muscle-bound, imposing and carrying a weapon, Abe was the complete antithesis of that.<ref name=\"Unlikely Game Heroes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-unlikeliest-badasses-gaming/?page=2 |title=The Top 7\u2026 Unlikeliest badasses in gaming |publisher=Games Radar |date=2011-10-03 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Game Revolution Exoddus Review\" />\nLanning said he wanted his protagonists to represent the everyman, the average chump, so they're not the \"steroided out, muscle-bound heroes you want to be, they're the poor schumucks you actually are,\" so as to better symbolize the Average Joe that is exploited unknowingly by corporations.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Oddworld's senior animator Scott Easley said Abe is \"not a brainiac, he's not a jack of all trades, he's not a master anything, he's a goofbag... but he's indicative of a much greater world that's out there.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> Lanning explained the process of designing and characterising Abe involved an American meat institute promo, Pakistani ''chuhas'', and \"classic American misinformation\" given to \"seriously troubled production designers.\"<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Being a character that Sherry McKenna described as one that \"people could really identify with, not the character we'd like to be,\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> Abe couldn't carry a weapon. \"The biggest problem was, if Abe could carry a gun, then general gaming behavior means that he's going to start solving all his problems with a gun, and that was not the Abe we wanted to create.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> Instead, Lanning wanted the hero to be empathetically driven, and he believed \"It was a message that was really ready to be heard by the executive class in the industry\".<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> The only problem was that video games did not have mechanics to suit a character who fought with emotion and speech instead of guns. So they developed those mechanics, in the form of gamespeak and possession.<ref name=\"Lorne Interview Video\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOgUQxiNAnI |title=Interview Lorne Lanning |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref> Possession came from Lanning's desire to make Abe's mudokon creatures [[Shamanism|Shamanic]] by the way of being connected to the spiritual world\u2014an antithesis to the antagonist Glukkons who were industrialists.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> This gave Abe the ability to chant in order to possess the mind and body of Slig guards, using them to sneak past areas undetected, carry out tasks he could not do himself, or kill with their machine guns.\n\nThe second staple of Oddworld games, and what would be Abe's other weapon\u2014gamespeak\u2014was a feature of the game that allowed Abe to communicate with other Mudokons in order to instruct them to safety and rescue. Lanning described gamespeak as \"a way to try to have meaningful verbal action that would also create a closer connection... to our characters... a necessary ingredient designed to make you care more for the Mudokons you were supposed to rescue.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> What Lanning found throughout the history of games was that they mostly followed the same paradigm:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|Aggression over time equals rewards. It doesn't matter if you're shooting anything or bouncing on their heads, it's all the same concept. And so we thought, if we could change the paradigm to be empathy equals rewards over time, but still not sacrifice the things that are fun about action and adventure, then we could start to get a little more heart going, and that might start to do things like pick up on the female demographic, get more women interested in games. But it meant evolving the video game character. What does a classic entertainment character do and what does a video game character do? Classic characters talk, and they listen, and they communicate and have relationships with other characters. \n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= GDC 2000<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" />\n}}\n\nAnd by giving Abe the ability to communicate and feel emotions for the characters he saved or lost, it made him \"the guy that in our hearts, we identify with... why we care so much for him.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> One of the [[Game engine|engines]] created and trademarked by Oddworld Inhabitants for ''Oddysee'' was the Aware Lifeforms in Virtual Entertainment (A.L.I.V.E) engine. Lanning views it as \"a conceptual theme more than a technological evolution\" that aimed to create virtual characters with believable personalities and visible awareness because, \"if characters feel more compelling and self aware\u2014then we increase the possibility of engaging our audience emotionally.\"<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> Abe was also given an infinite number of lives because \"I wanted you to never give up. No matter how fucking sucky you were, if you stuck with it, you'd get there. And that's life, man.\"<ref name=\"Vice Enduring Abe\" />\n\nWhen ''Abe's Oddysee'' was released in Japan, two changes were made to the game's visuals, namely during the [[Full motion video|FMV]] sequences. The first was due to the graphic image of a severed mudokon head atop a stick in the introductory movie depicting the new \"Mudokon Pops\" item about to be marketed by the Glukkons, shocking Abe into his escape and thus beginning the game. In the Japanese release, the image of the Mudokon Pops was changed to resemble a cartoonlike [[Ice pop|Popsicle]] with eyes and a mouth, considered a \"happier\" image by Oddworld Inhabitants.<ref name=\"Mudokon Pops Change\">Ballistic Publishing, ''The Art of Oddworld: The First Ten Years 1994\u20132004'', page 58</ref> It was not until 2011 that Lanning revealed just why the image was changed for Japanese audiences. A week before press was to begin in Japan to market the game, a Japanese middle-school student murdered a peer, severed his head, and hung it on the fence of a school. Lanning saw that this was \"very, very distressful to the country of Japan that this happened... so they said that it would probably be a good idea to change it. We were asked and we weren't stupid, so we complied.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> The altered image remained in the sequel released in all territories. Said Lanning, \"I never liked the first one. But that was just what came out from the artists and I... try to give [them] some room and not change everything to my liking.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\nThe second change made to the final Japanese version concerned the appearance of Abe's four-fingered hand. The developers found that in Japan, a hand with four fingers was common amongst \"a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society.\"<ref name=\"Oddworld FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/about/faq/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> Over time, the displaying of a four-fingered hand gesture towards another came to be seen as an insult implying that they were subclass. To use that in a form of entertainment could \"very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group\" who likened the insult to that of [[Nazism|Nazis]] making [[Jews]] wear the [[Yellow badge|yellow star]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name=\"Oddworld FAQ\" /> Lanning understood how it might have been distasteful to ignore that part of Japanese culture by leaving Abe with his four fingers, especially considering a large part of the game's setting was in a meat-packing plant. But when he discovered that the group would accept a payment of one million dollars to keep the insulting image in the game, \"that becomes extortion, rather than a principle.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> As a result, Oddworld Inhabitants decided to let the pressure groups have their way by changing the image to give Abe three fingers, so that the developers could maintain their morality in not paying off extortionists. The irony of the controversy was that it was an example of life imitating art, as in the game, Abe was the representative of a subclass of species \"discriminated against for being who he was... because they don't like his kind here.\"<ref name=\"Oddworld FAQ\" />\n\n====''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' (1998)====\n\nThe success of ''Oddysee'' required Oddworld Inhabitants to make a sequel, which forced them to break from their original plan of a five game \"Quintology\" with the next game intended to be ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''. In an example of life imitating art, the corporate machine of Oddworld's publishers, GT Interactive, pressured the studio to make a new game for the PlayStation by Christmas 1998.<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |title=Editorial: Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |publisher=gog.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> Lorne Lanning refused to make ''Munch'' for PlayStation because he wanted that game to use 3D environments and he felt the hardware was not good enough to handle that.<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" /> The short turnaround between games meant Lanning had to think fast about what game to produce. In order to complete a game in nine months, he decided on a direct sequel to ''Abe's Oddysee'' using the same engine, added improvements to gamespeak, a [[quicksave]] system,<ref name=\"Exoddus Adventure Classic Gaming\" /> more cinematic sequences and even more intricate backgrounds.<ref name=\"Game Revolution Exoddus Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/oddworld-abes-exoddus |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus Review |publisher=Game Revolution |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> Lanning said his studio \"killed ourselves getting ''Abe's Exoddus'' done in nine months\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" /> and McKenna reiterated, \"it was hell... not fun... we got it done in nine months because that's what you're supposed to do\u2014deliver on time.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> A bonus game outside of the original Quintology,<ref name=\"Exoddus Adventure Classic Gaming\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/274/ |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> ''Abe's Exoddus'' released in 1998 for PlayStation and PC, continuing the story where ''Oddysee'' left off using elements that were left out of its predecessor due to time constraints. Abe is sent on a quest by his deceased ancestors to destroy the mega factories that produce Soulstorm Brew\u2014a product made from the bones of dead mudokons, and rescue 300 of his kind, discovering an even deeper connection to his spiritual past along the way. And like the previous game, \"it speaks about hope, it speaks about changing for the better, it speaks about not being beaten down by the big guy.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_fnhF1XvGI |title=Icons G4 \u2013 Oddworld \u2013 Part 2 of 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Exoddus'' may not have been in the initial plan, Lanning believes the bonus game worked because they wanted the Oddworld universe to be a franchise with infinite stories:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|Our idea for Oddworld was to birth a rich universe of relevant material with endearing characters, one that we could reflect those issues that we felt most deeply about ... [and then] convert them into interactive entertainment. If we did it right, there was no reason why the universe we had created couldn\u2019t tell infinite stories. Much like Star Wars.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= gog.com<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" />\n}}\n\nSo while the Quintology was the core focus of Oddworld Inhabitants, bonus games in the same universe were not unwelcome.\n\nOne of the adjustments made for ''Exoddus'' was the increase in humor compared to ''Oddysee''. While the dark themes of [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], [[Exploitation fiction|exploitation]] and [[capitalism]] were still present, Lanning felt they needed to be offset by more humor. Some of that came in the form of the added ability to possess Abe's own farts and use them as explosives. \"We believe in laughs... they make for good entertainment... and it made sense with our super dark themes to give them a lighter heart with more dysfunctional things to do.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" />\n\n====''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'' (2001)====\n\nThe studio's third game was ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'', a 3D platform game developed with their upgraded A.L.I.V.E 2 engine<ref name=\"Oddworld Fact Sheet\">{{cite web|url=http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_keyfacts.shtml |title=Oddworld Fact Sheet |publisher=Oddworld Library |date=October 2004 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> and published by Infogrames exclusively for the [[Microsoft]] Xbox console. It was the studio's first foray into the 3D gaming landscape. Lanning wanted to raise the bar for the performance of computer graphics in his games and required a larger output from a console, and found the Xbox was the only one capable of his expectations for the game.<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\" />\n\nAbe returns, this time to assist Munch, the last of the gabbit species on all of Oddworld. His species has been fished to extinction by the Vykkers because their eggs are a delicacy marketed as \"gabbiar\" for the dominant species on the planet, and Munch seeks to find the last known can of gabbiar eggs in order to revive his species. Like Abe, Munch was the embodiment of the \"disturbing, sad reality that's happening in our world today [turned] into a character that people like\" in the dysfunctional 21st century.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Where Disney \"won the 20th century, that's not the future, because kids just don't dig that anymore, we're dealing with different kids... it's a dysfunctional world... if we can embody dysfunctional characters that are really endearing, then we think that's what people are really going to connect with.\"<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Munch's conceptualisation came from hundreds of design concepts based on combining imagery of cats in [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] medical labs and facial cream testing divisions with images of rabbits used in pharmaceutical testing and the \"pure evil\" of U.S. radiation experiments on unwitting elderly citizens seeking medical assistance.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> The theme of species [[extinction]] came from Lanning's experiences as a child growing up, fishing on the [[Connecticut]] river and watching species of fish literally die out due to acid rain and factories built nearby.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> He wanted Munch to embody loneliness and loss to hit the heart strings of the audience,<ref name=\"Icons Part 2\" /> and as with Abe, he begins the game at the \"conceptual position of biggest loser, the most downtrodden, hopeless possible position\" because \"the Oddworld series is all about big, corporate bullies picking on the little guy,\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> and Lanning wanted \"every hero we built on Oddworld [to] come out of that soil,\" so his story was again couched in \"the dark side of globalisation\" that would be the basis of all Oddworld stories:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|so, I knew for Abe I wanted the food crisis and the plight of the third world completely exploited labour to be centre stage. But I also knew that in this universe [...] I wanted to be able to say that later on we\u2019re going to take a flight, say this far away, and we\u2019ll land somewhere else and then we\u2019ll focus on the animal testing victim, the ultra-last guy you would like to be, the lab-rat, who has nothing going on you know, so that was ''Munch\u2019s Oddysee''.\" \n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= Katzenjammer Records<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" />\n}}\n\nThe development of ''Munch's Oddysee'' came after the decision by Oddworld Inhabitants to shift from the PC and PlayStation One platforms to Microsoft's new Xbox console. While the fans responded with hate mail,<ref name=\"Icons Part 2\" /> Lanning explained it was both a technological decision, and a survival decision for his company. On the technological front, the studio began developing the game for the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], but had two problems\u2014the \"unfriendly development environment of the hardware\" made it difficult to program for, and the quality of animation was not as good as Lanning wanted it, relative to how much they were spending.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> However, Lanning saw that the Xbox had the superior graphics capabilities he required to produce the game.<ref name=\"The Future's Odd\" /> It could withstand multiple dozen characters moving and interacting on screen at the same time in the quality of animation they wanted, and with an evolving environmental landscape in the background.<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeySzikrGK8 |title=Xbox Interview \u2013 Lorne Lanning (Oddworld Inhabitants) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref> \"Only Xbox gives us the graphical muscle and intense digital sound to unleash our creative juices and allow us to bring the imaginary world and rich characters of Oddworld to life,\" said Lanning.<ref name=\"Microsoft Oddworld Deal\" /> For development purposes, the game was made to run on a PC, and being that the Xbox was billed as the PC in a box, the change made sense.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> And Microsoft's paradigm of being a console for the entire family fit perfectly with their own view of their studio.<ref name=\"Remaking a Legend\" /> Microsoft also personally asked Lanning what he wanted a possible console to include before they even begun development on the Xbox, and when he saw the system that they built had included a lot of what he requested, he could see that the development of ''Munch'' was now possible.<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\" />\n\nBut the decision to move to Microsoft was as much about his company surviving as it was about the Xbox being the only console to withstand the technological advancements of ''Munch's Oddysee''. Rumours that they were paid to jump to Microsoft were false.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> With Oddworld's publishers, GT Interactive, about to be sold, Lanning heard from other developers that its buyer, Infogrames, was cutting the budgets of its titles to three million dollars, and for his new game to be projected as costing ten million dollars with a studio operating between 500 and 700 thousand dollars a month, Lanning realised, \"this is just not going to work... and that's just common practice in capitalism\".<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> The game couldn't be made under that condition, so they needed to find a new publisher, which was when Microsoft expressed interest in publishing their games, but under the condition that they release ''Munch'' exclusively for the Xbox.<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> It was a time where money was as important as ever, because unlike the current generation of gaming, developers were not given the tools to build games for the Xbox and PS2; they had to build their own tools first, at a great expense, and wanting ''Munch'''s story to be better, while maintaining the soul of ''Abe's Oddysee'' and the quality of the Oddworld brand as their mascot had to compete with globally recognised icons like [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] and [[Lara Croft]], Lanning's company was left with no other option but to choose the console that could withstand its new technologies and afford to lend them the money required to keep it alive in the industry, even if it meant the fans on other platforms would not have access to the game.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> On 23 October 2000, Microsoft announced the signing of a deal with Infogrames, securing exclusive rights to publishing and distributing the next four Oddworld Inhabitants titles, beginning with ''Munch's Oddysee'' the following year.<ref name=\"Microsoft Oddworld Deal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-secures-exclusive-worldwide-rights-to-publish-oddworld-games-for-xbox-75154917.html |title=Microsoft Secures Exclusive Worldwide Rights to Publish 'Oddworld' Games For Xbox |publisher=PR Newswire |date=2000-10-23 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> Lanning expressed his regret at leaving the PC platform, but Microsoft refused to agree to a PC version of the game, and \"unless you're going to pay for [games] yourself... you have to work with partners\" who place constraints on products.<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" />\n\nLanning described ''Munch's Oddysee'' as the project that has him the least satisfied. He took responsibility for the game's faults in acknowledging that he was immature, couldn't handle the pressure that went with managing a larger group of 75 developers and was too over-demanding for what became unrealistic goals.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> Lanning later explained in 2006 that video game developers were being held back creatively by the race to develop newer technologies, a fact that affected the production of ''Munch'' because of the change from 2D to 3D that was demanded by the market of the new Xbox.<ref name=\"Consumer Feelings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/videogames-do-not-reflect-the-feelings-of-consumers-says-lanning |title=Videogames do not reflect the feelings of consumers, says Lanning |publisher=Games Industry International |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> The team working on ''Munch's Oddysee'' was the same team that produced ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Exoddus'', and thus they had no experience in 3D game development.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> In the case of the 2D Abe games, the backgrounds were paintings processed into sprites, pre-rendered and photo retouched, allowing them to add much more detail that wasn't possible in the 3D environment of ''Munch's Oddysee''. Three months from release, the team realised that development was not going to be complete in time, so \"four or five\" new programmers were brought in and replaced most of the development team, who re-wrote the entire game in nine months.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> As for the increase in humor and its \"cartoony\" style, Lanning explained that Microsoft thought of the Oddworld franchise as its ''Super Mario Bros.''.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\nGilray revealed the failure of Munch left the team heartbroken.<ref name=\"Remaking a Legend\" /> Lanning felt that they, and in particular he, under-delivered on the promise of this new game, and for the first time since before ''Abe's Oddysee'', he felt a sense of vulnerability in the industry.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> It was a \"turbulent time in the industry\" with publishers going in and out of business, budgets rising and publishers and developers still learning to manage the changes,\" but the biggest factor that worried Lanning was the exposure brought about by Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console.

IGN described the new elements as a welcome change that showed the Oddworld franchise and Lorne Lanning's ability as a designer had the ability to adapt and evolve with the times after what it described as the failure of ''Munch's Oddysee''.<ref name=\"IGN Stranger Review P1\" /> The last of the game's new elements concerned the live ammunition made available to the player. Lanning explained that he wanted to give fans a new reason to enjoy a first-person shooter that went beyond the simple choice of \"do I shoot 'em in the knee or do I shoot 'em in the head,\" so the ammunition within the game came in the form of living creatures possessing their own AI, meaning each would respond differently and cause a unique effect when shot from the player's crossbow.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> The change in setting and style also allowed for a different kind of storytelling, as it begins with a steady pace of Stranger bounty hunting to save \"moolah\" to pay for lifesaving surgery before evolving \"into a touching tale of redemption that complements Abe's own adventures\" in a shift that increases the game's drama and pace in the final hours.<ref name=\"Stranger's Second Chance\" /> During development, there were tests to add multiplayer to the game, which would have been another first for the franchise, but that never eventuated.<ref name=\"Wrath of the Wild\" />\n\nBut some of the traditional Oddworld elements that originally made the brand unique returned. Most notably, the artificial intelligence of Oddworld's species, as governed by their A.L.I.V.E. game engine, evolved from the ''Munch'' iteration to create a more \"believable personality and visible awareness\".<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> For example, how the player treats the local townsfolk, Clakkerz, dictates how they in turn treat the player. \"They will hide if you hurt them and... will also help you out if are nice about it...

He explained that when they developed their first game, the sales expectation was only half of what they were able to deliver, but for the second game, the sales expectation was almost twice as much as what they could deliver, and for the third and fourth games, the sales expectations again increased while the actual sales further decreased.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> But he explained that the reason for their diminishing successes were due to what he refers to as FUBARS\u2014elements beyond the control of the developers, but influence the production, distribution and publishing of the games\u2014that begun very low during the development of their first game but increased by up to five times as much by the time the fourth game was being developed:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|In the financial space, they don't talk about how many games got lost in the distribution company's warehouse when commercials were running.

And then the financial crash caused a lot of financing troubles in the United States.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= GameCityNights<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" />\n}}\n\nWhen the studio decided to make the ''Citizen Siege'' film, they had a $40\u201360 million budget<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> and were given the green light as an R-rated CG animated feature, they went into the early stages of development.<ref name=\"Lost Oddworld Projects\" /> But the [[global financial crisis]] \"changed the terms in Hollywood [and] greatly reduced the chance of success\".<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> Publishers became even more risk-averse and Lanning realised it was going to be an \"up-hill battle\" to get the movie off the ground.<ref name=\"Lost Oddworld Projects\" /> Being a smaller company affected by the financial constraints more than bigger game developers, Lanning decided to put ''Citizen Siege'', \"Wage Wars\" and all other associated projects from this era on hold. However, his partner Sherry McKenna said the abandonment of ''Citizen Siege'' was the result of \" 'clear differences' with a third party\" that has not yet been identified.<ref name=\"Oddysee, Exoddus, And Wrath\" />\n\nThe following year, Lanning found his Oddworld Inhabitants company returning to where it all began\u2014video games. While his work on the Quintology did cease after ''Munch's Oddysee'', Lanning stood by his claim when Oddworld ceased producing video games that he denied ending game production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spong.com/feature/10109288/Interview-Lorne-Lanning-sets-the-record-straight-only-on-SPOnG-com |title= Interviews// Lorne Lanning sets the record straight only on SPOnG.com |publisher=Spong |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> This proved true when their newest collaborators\u2014[[Just Add Water (company)|Just Add Water]]\u2014announced they were working with Oddworld Inhabitants.\n\n====\"Oddworld\" film====\nLorne Lanning says that he and Sherry would love nothing more than to make an Oddworld film. Instead of writing the Abe stories as games, he wrote them as films and with deep character development because games were supposed to be just the launching pad for the property that is Oddworld, which would then feed into movies when the technology became more powerful and the CG cheaper.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> Separate from the Citizen Siege project but utilising the same machinima technology, the studio halted development before shopping the concept around because the 2008 global financial crisis meant no film publisher would take a risk on them for a $30\u201340 million project, and Lanning believes \"Hollywood is a disaster right now\".<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" />\n\n====Xmobb by Oddmob, Inc.====\nWhile Citizen Siege and its associated projects are on hold, Lanning maintains that he wants to tell those stories, but \"that I'm going to have to pay for it myself. And that's part of what the new business is about.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> That new venture, called Xmobb, was created by Lorne Lanning and his longtime business partner, Oddworld co-founder and CEO Sherry McKenna, along with Daniel Goldman (co-founder of the [[Total Entertainment Network]]) in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> Xmobb was described as offering social networking with video and gaming services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=112318370 |title=Company Overview of Xmobb, Inc.|publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe business came about when Lanning saw that the human attention span was being spent on [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] more than on any other platform.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> Originally, he believed the most important thing in the video game industry was to build your own intellectual property, but he learned the newest IP was \"people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_IAP8304 |title=Massive Concepts in the Department of Art |publisher=SXSW |date=2011-03-13 |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828211739/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_IAP8304 |archivedate=28 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His plan was to build a space where \"cultures [are] more connected to more passion points\" like friends, shows, hobbies etc. and where they can all be facilitated without anyone or anything being left out.<ref name=\"PlayStation Blogcast\" /> Rather than telling audiences to invest their time in an IP created by someone else, Lanning looked at the relationships people were enjoying and the media they were sharing:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|On Facebook, every hour, 150 years of linear video is being shared between people. Every hour. Every day, YouTube is serving two billion videos. Now, two billion videos served is more than all the networks and all the cable companies combined have served in their lifetime.

This trust was very important in Lanning's view because it demonstrated the return of something that had been lost over the years:\n\n{{centered pull quote|No matter what side of the fence you live on; right, left, religious, atheist, this party, that party, we can all agree on one thing\u2014we've all been screwed by the shitbags that are running things. As a by-product, trust is a new currency, simply because it's been decimated. We don't trust corporations, we don\u2019t trust governments, we don't trust anything anymore. Say, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] is coming out with a new movie, they'll have a 200-million-dollar campaign about it, but you and me probably couldn't give a shit about it. But if you told me 'I saw this movie and it's awesome. You've just got to see it', then I\u2019m going to go see that movie. You had more weight and more value on my impression than 200 million dollars from Paramount ever could, because there's no trust. Trust is in the relationships and it's the new currency.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= OddBlog<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n}}\n\nLanning's idea was a \"space where people [can] gather en-masse to watch the same content, with people they know who are already watching together\" in \"virtual theatres\" created by anyone under any theme, interest or topic while others gather to watch and contribute content in a constant stream.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> He thought of this gathering as the video game equivalent of the [[Super Bowl]]\u2014millions of people gathering together in support of something they care about or something they want to fight for.<ref name=\"PlayStation Blogcast\" /> By giving anyone with a computer the opportunity to share information with people all over the world in realtime, viewers would be able to see what is really going on in the world and begin to trust each other, as opposed to what they are being told by a \"corporate funded media landscape that has its own agenda that is anything but democratic in nature [and] a massive misinformation machine that serves [[Wall Street]] and the [[White House]].\"<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> It was Lanning's goal to use this new trust to enlighten the world to what is really going on. He revisited the topic during the issue of Microsoft's DRM policy after the launch of the Xbox One, saying \"companies should focus more on building brand trust and allowing the audience to filter who is a good guy and who's bad... that's what social networks and forums deal with [and] the more a company can build trust, the better they seem to do.\"<ref name=\"Forbes Xbox DRM Issue\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2013/06/19/oddworld-inhabitants-founder-lorne-lanning-believes-microsoft-will-right-xbox-one-ship/ |title=Oddworld Inhabitants Founder Lorne Lanning Believes Microsoft Will Right Xbox One Ship |work=Forbes |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}</ref>\n\nLanning stressed that this new business venture was not about trying to make money for money's sake, nor to make a 20\u201330 million dollar Oddworld title that would compete on the market with 60\u2013100 million dollar games.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> First and foremost, the idea was to \"facilitate a way for people to come together and share in realtime, faster and faster, [so] we'll get enlightened faster as well.\" with the added bonus that \"if we do [Xmobb] right, I get to finance the [Citizen Siege] movies myself and then they're not going to be compromised\" by big publishers.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\nIn August 2011, Lanning said the launch was a few months away, with patents filed under the business name Oddmobb, Inc.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/patents/assignee/oddmobb-inc/ |title=Oddmobb, Inc.|publisher=Patentdocs |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> but at the Eurogamer Expo in September 2012, he revealed the failure of Xmobb.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> The associated websites have since been shut down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xmobb.com/ |title=Xmobb |publisher=Xmobb, Inc. |accessdate=2013-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721160910/http://xmobb.com/ |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://oddmobb.com/ |title=Oddmobb |publisher=Oddmobb, Inc. |accessdate=2013-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927032609/http://oddmobb.com/ |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> When Sony announced the PS4 in February 2013, Lanning revisited the launch and failure of Xmobb.

He found that Sony was treating its classic games the way [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[iTunes]] treat classic music, allowing them new life for new and old audiences. Fifteen years after Lanning first created Abe, he was surprised to find that people still email him with the same passion he has for the games.<ref name=\"Stick It To The Man\" /> \"I was happily relieved and surprised that it did stick that much in people's minds,\" said Lanning, \"I didn't start Oddworld as a businessman, I started it as a fan.\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> And by a stroke of luck, the people involved in making the decisions to emulate [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] games on the PS3 are fans of the game and were also involved in Sony during its original launch.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\" /> Now, Lanning has completely changed his view and firmly believes that content created today will have life in the future, as long as the game has quality, and utilizes digital distribution.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" />\n\nDigital distribution is one of the important elements in sustaining the Oddworld/Just Add Water partnership in the video game industry because of the vast savings in cost associated with moving games from developer to consumer digitally instead of physically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgamernation.com/interview-stewart-gilray-ceo-of-just-add-water-ltd/ |title=Interview: Stewart Gilray, CEO of Just Add Water Ltd.|publisher=New Gamer Nation |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> According to Lanning, when ''Abe's Oddysee'' was completed and distributed to the consumer, 20% of royalties went towards his team of developers. They then needed the game to make back approximately four million dollars in earnings using just their 20% in royalties to break even on the funds provided by their publisher, GT Interactive. Once that had been achieved, under the model that assumed the cost of ''Abe's Oddysee'' remained at US$59.99, his team of developers would receive just US$7 for every unit sold.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/26/why-lorne-lanning-went-from-aaa-games-to-indie-and-loudly-loves-it-interview/ |title=Why Lorne Lanning went from triple-A games to indie \u2014 and loudly loves it (interview) |publisher=Gamesbeat |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> The rest would go towards paying all the associated costs that go with publishing, marketing and distributing the game, such as disc manufacturing, licensing fees, fuel for transporting the game to retailers, retail staff and more.<ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> Gilray revealed that in 2013\u20132014, if Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water chose to distribute a game on disc at retail for the [[Xbox 360]], they would have to pay for a minimum of 50,000 discs per territory, at a cost of $600,000, just for manufacturing the discs, before factoring in marketing and development costs, hence the reason for higher costs at the retail shelf.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> And on top of everything else, their physical disc would have to compete with countless other games for selection on the retailer shelf.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\">{{cite web |url=http://epdaily.tv/all/podcast/episode-30/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227041925/http://epdaily.tv/all/podcast/episode-30/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-12-27 |title=Episode 30: It's an Oddworld in the Basement |publisher=ep daily |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2013-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nBut their current digital distribution model eliminates the \"radical chasm between who really got the money and who's been doing a lot of the work.\"<ref name=\"Game Theory: Devs vs. Pubs\" /> A game that would sell for US$9.99 on Steam, [[Xbox Live Arcade|XBLA]] or PSN would still net the studio US$7 for every unit sold.<ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> So with digital distribution, all of the costs associated with distributing a physical game are non-existent as the studio \"is not paying for plastic, advertising, shipping or a percentage to retailers... we're just giving it to gamers at a lower price, because we can.\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> Under this model, the player is funding the games more than ever, with 70% of their money going directly to the developer to make more games,<ref name=\"Lanning Kinda Funny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPnUt0VbTJA |title=Oddworld's Lorne Lanning on Games, E3, Government \u2013 Kinda Funny Stage Show E3 2015 |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-06-21 |accessdate=2015-06-22}}</ref> as opposed to the old model where 12% went to the developer and 88% went to the publisher. So the risk being undertaken by the developers with each project is considerably less, because they only need to sell 50,000 units for them to break even and stay in business, as opposed to the one million required in the first week of sales and a 5\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 return overall when using money provided by a major publisher.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> And because they don't have to concern themselves with reaching unit sales targets, they can spend time and money on extras like [[PlayStation Vita|Vita]] and [[Wii U]] ports, despite operating at a financial loss with ''New 'n' Tasty!'' on those platforms, so as to not lock audiences out because of the platform they choose to play,<ref name=\"Lorne GDC Greggy\" /> whereas the model used by the big publishers would be to cancel those ports or ship them as an inferior copy to the other ports because there wouldn't be enough of a monetary return from their audience to justify the extra time spent on making them.<ref name=\"Lorne GDC Greggy\" /> But now, with their Just Add Water partnership, all elements of the business are working together towards the common goal of producing games to fund more games, working for just a 1.5\u00d7 return in order to stay in business, keep people employed, grow the business, and in turn, the games.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\"/> This lower sales requirement affords them the ability to experiment with their games in a way that wasn't possible when the budgets were in excess of ten million dollars, because a failure does not mean the end of the business as it did during the Stranger's Wrath era when they took a risk aiming for perfection using untried concepts without a history of user feedback to guide them.<ref name=\"PSNation Interview Gilray Lanning\" />\n\nLanning says a 1\u00bd\u00d7 return for their upcoming game would allow the company's two groups to focus on two projects\u2014a new version of ''Abe's Exoddus ''using ''New 'n' Tasty!''<nowiki/>'s engine'', ''and a new game.<ref name=\"PSNation Interview Gilray Lanning\" /> And the ports released by Just Add Water under this model are paving the way for more ambitious plans, as \"each project is a bigger risk and a bigger step.\"<ref name=\"The Future's Odd\" /> The first risk was the ''Oddboxx'' on Steam, followed by porting the ''Oddboxx'' to [[PlayStation 3]], ''Stranger HD'' and then ''Munch HD''. Now, their success has paved the way for their biggest project (and risk) to date\u2014rebuilding ''Abe's Oddysee'' to make ''Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!''<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> And though this game has taken longer and cost more than the previous titles, the risk of going out of business or, \"splitting the baby\", is still considerably lower than had the developers gone through a major publisher. ''Stranger's Wrath HD'' for PS3, PC and Vita cost $250,000\u2013300,000, but made a profit of one million dollars, all of which went into the budget for ''New 'n' Tasty!''.<ref name=\"Moonhawk Gilray\" /> As Lanning says, \"Oddworld is about sustainable content in an unsustainable world\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> Their growth might be small, but being that their products are crowd-financed by the audience buying the games, there is no need to appease investors that have brought no value beyond their own cash, or answer to a board that wants to implement policies the studio doesn't agree with, which \"is what drives most of the pressure and most of the distractions\".<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\"/> [[Sensible Software]] co-founder [[Jon Hare]] says that other independent game developers have seen this new option and are not looking back, because they have been [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] from the retail shelves by the bigger companies like EA Games and [[Ubisoft]].<ref name=\"Game Theory: Devs vs. Pubs\">{{cite web|url=http://gametheoryonline.com/2011/02/15/video-games-developers-vs-publishers/ |title= Developers vs. Publishers: Who Wins? |publisher=Game Theory |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>\n\nUnder the agreement between Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water that eliminates the traditional distribution models, \"most of the money that the gamer is spending will come right back to the developer,\"<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 3\" /> meaning the majority of profits made after sales recoup production costs goes directly into making more games, not enriching the owners.<ref name=\"Stick It To The Man\" /><ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> In addition to the profits made from ''Stranger's Wrath HD'', the entire profits from ''Munch's Oddysee HD'' on PS3 and Vita go towards ''New 'n' Tasty!''<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> This allows the studio to sell their games at a cheaper price point than the big studios making Triple-A titles.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 3\" /> Lanning refers to this relationship as that of [[sharecropping]], as opposed to [[serfdom]].<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> And he's finding that in this new landscape where \"creators can find an audience at a lower price, offer a product cheaper, and directly nurture that community,\" that the big publishers are finding it hard to \"justify their value\" in the industry now, especially to the gamers that purchase their products at a higher cost, with most of their money going to the publishers themselves.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/26/why-lorne-lanning-went-from-aaa-games-to-indie-and-loudly-loves-it-interview/ |title=Why Lorne Lanning went from triple-A games to indie \u2014 and loudly loves it (interview) |publisher=Gamesbeat |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> Gilray said of his time at Lanning's Berkely house in 2010, \"I came away from that with the feeling that, well, that they felt, knew, the game and the brand were in the right hands.\"<ref name=\"Gamefreak Gilray Interview\" /> It is still Lorne Lanning's (and now Stewart Gilray's) ambition to complete the original five-game Quintology that begun with ''Abe's Oddysee'' and continued with ''Munch's Oddysee''.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /><ref name=\"Gamefreak Gilray Interview\" /> And while that ambition was halted by the decision to abandon the publisher/studio relationship, Oddworld Inhabitants, in partnership with Just Add Water, and utilizing digital distribution, are now better equipped to continue the Quintology\u2014this time with Just Add Water as the developer and Oddworld as their micro-publisher.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> As for platforms, they refer to themselves as \"platform-agnostic\"\u2014happy to port their games to any platform.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" />\n\nThe other change to the video game industry that happened at the same time was the release of the [[iPhone]] democratising the industry. Before platforms like the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] allowed anyone to sell their games, the only game developers around were businesses because consoles required a developer to purchase multiple $20,000 [[software development kit]]s in order to build their game on their platform.<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> But when the iPhone came out, the SDK was free to download, and the App Store was free to upload to. This caused an influx of games into the mobile space, because now \"the guys who didn't have the ability to get ten dev stations before can make a business\" and it \"caused a whole migration of talent into a space where they could reach an audience on their own.\"<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> As a result, even the big development companies working on Triple-A titles created their own apps company to open up another access point that they didn't have before. Sony was the first between the two big console developers to follow this trend, which led to Lanning's criticism of Microsoft at E3 in 2013, which was reluctant to allow independent developers onto its console as easily as Sony did with the PlayStation.<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\">{{cite web|url=http://www.godisageek.com/2015/06/lorne-lanning-interview/ |title=It's an Odd, Odd World: An Interview with Lorne Lanning |publisher=God Is A Geek |date=2015-06-20 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref>\n\nLanning's plan to transform Oddworld Inhabitants from a game-developing studio to a self-sustaining micro-publisher independent of \"disconnected investor demands,\" with an ability to communicate with its audience, is where Lanning says the independent developer movement needs to go.<ref name=\"Spare Shelf Space\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-08-02-lanning-hey-buddy-can-you-spare-some-shelf-space |title=Lanning: Hey Buddy, can you spare some shelf space? |publisher=Games Industry |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref> Oddworld and Just Add Water are \"too small to be disruptive, but we can... succeed in the disruptive landscape.\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> And in January 2013, Lanning revealed Oddworld Inhabitants has not sought publishers since its last signing with EA in 2004.<ref name=\"Tell it like it is\" />\n\n====Just Add Water releases====\nJust Add Water's first release in partnership with Oddworld Inhabitants was the porting of 2005's ''Stranger's Wrath'' to the PC's digital network, Steam, in 2010.<ref name=\"Moonhawk Gilray\" /> That was followed by a high-definition remastered edition, ''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD'', released digitally on 21 December 2011 for PlayStation 3.

He hopes that studio heads will see the franchise as \"a successful IP, a decades-old franchise with a loyal fan following that sells millions of units\" that makes it impossible for them to resist investing in a movie or TV series.<ref name=\"Oddworld TV Series\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alphr.com/life-culture/1007233/oddworld-could-get-a-tv-series-if-lorne-lanning-has-his-way |title=KOddworld could get a TV series if Lorne Lanning has his way |publisher=alphr |date=2017-10-03 |accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref> One of the methods for preparing the franchise to cross into new media is to upscale their database of design assets from the upcoming ''Soulstorm'' game beyond that that will be used in the game, to a level required by these media. His preference is to develop a prolonged TV series, because it \"is way more engaging than doing a 90-minute movie that goes out in one and maybe gets a sequel,\" and is more within their budget of $10 million.<ref name=\"Oddworld TV Series\" />\n\n==Purpose==\n\nWhen Lanning was young, he felt lost and overwhelmed by what he saw was wrong with the world, as consumers were fed lies through television and newspapers. He grew up being programmed with information about nuclear submarines, global thermal nuclear war, visions of napalming during the Vietnam war on new colour televisions and the possibility of a new generation of people not dying of old age, at a time when he was just discovering mythologies such as Santa Claus.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> He stored an enormous amount of what he wanted to say concerning what was going on in the world about which the media was not forthcoming.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6BxbX-VHM |title=Eurogamer Expo Develop Session \u2013 Lorne Lanning & Stewart Gilray |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-10-05 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}</ref> And he felt that entertainers like [[Steven Spielberg]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Bob Dylan]] were helping to save the world with entertainment, which was when he discovered that the media most influential on public opinion were mass-produced and electronic.<ref name=\"OI History\" /> He was inspired by the influence of the media on his life: how [[Jim Henson]] and [[Sesame Street]] taught him to read where school had failed; how [[Dr. Seuss]] was able to create stories still being read to new generations that give people a better moral compass and healthier ways to look at the world; how [[George Orwell]] took his personal experiences during World War II to create stories designed to wake people up to the realities of the world around them; how George Lucas's [[Star Wars]] could succeed where religion and philosophy were failing at a time of religious deficit in America, making him \"believe in the possibilities of entertainment for change.\"<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" />\n\nWhen Lanning was working with Sherry McKenna at Rhythm and Hues, his eyes were opened to the possibilities that the CG industry had to offer. While most in the industry were talking CG down, he correctly predicted its potential, watching [[Pixar]] become \"the most successful film studio in world history\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> He saw videos games in the same way, describing them as the \"pop of pop mediums,\" and wanted to get involved because of its potential to become the most successful medium and offer \"nutritious\" content.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> By nutritious, he meant that if video games were a part of the four main food groups, they would be in the \"junk food\" category, because they're not used to get a degree or a job, they're purely for pop entertainment.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> But Lanning believes that video games have the ability to become one of the nutritious food groups by offering useful content with a meaningful message and a psychic, spiritual value to users<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> In categorizing a nutritious game, Lanning explained that they should involve vision, creativity and a richness to lift themselves out of the narrowing of options he was beginning to see.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> And when games start to \"embody more of the heart that we expect from classical forms of entertainment... more of the soul that we get from a great movie,\" such as stories with emotional depth, powerful character dilemmas and emotional engagement from the audience, the video game industry will expand exponentially.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Lanning is first and foremost an artist, and \"as an artist, you're constantly trying to figure out how to integrate those things you care about in life in your medium of expression.\"<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> And he found that video games were the perfect medium for combining the philosophies and realities he's observed in the world with the tools and technologies he loves, allowing him to repackage that content into a viable story for an audience with a meaningful message about what is really going on in the world\u2014the [[Clif Bar]] instead of the potato chips.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> So he wanted to instil a morality in video games so that their message could give hope to the next generation of kids and make them feel less lost in the world. But he also wanted to weaponize the pop medium of video games to be used against the \"frauds\" in charge:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|It is people's responsibility in the world today to stand up, and stop being pushovers, and get off your knees, and stop just taking these lies and bullshit that are screwing up our planet, that are screwing up your retirements funds, that are screwing up the value of your home, of your business...

In the early 1990s, Lanning found that video game publishers were not interested in financing entire franchise properties that had plans for multiple sequels \"because sequels only sell 50% of the originals\".<ref name=\"GameOverGreggy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmesVFdEA38&#t=0m36s |title=Lorne Lanning (Special Guest) \u2013 The GameOverGreggy Show Ep. 72 |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-04-24 |accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref> Lanning saw this as the mistake [[20th Century Fox]] made by relinquishing ''Star Wars'' licensing rights to George Lucas. And Lanning realised that the reason sequels were not as successful as the originals was because video games did not come with emotionally compelling characters the way movies did. At this point, video game characters only existed to kill off other characters. So Lanning wanted to create a property that could be recognised as soon as it was seen, like The Muppets, like Star Wars and like Hanna Barber or the Looney Tunes so that new content within the same property, be they sequels or not, could maintain the brand familiarity of the originals, and hopefully its success. Fast forward to today and the video game industry is a sequel-driven industry.<ref name=\"GameOverGreggy\" /> Lanning likened Oddworld to a band making music, and he wanted to be \"the [[Pink Floyd]] of gaming as opposed to a [[Britney Spears]]\"\u2014the insinuation being that \"I don't want to be told [by the publisher] what to make. I want to make the songs I want to make.\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> And those were stories that convey deeper messages about what was really going on in the world, because the artist's vision was more important than the industry's economic requirements, \"I didn't care about making any entertainment if it's not going to be what I care about in life, and so to separate the two is something I'm not interested in.\"<ref name=\"Lanning Interview Gamereactor\" /> He believed the only way to do so was to \"build a globally-recognized brand [and] wind up with the sort of integrity that might stay intact over the years.\"\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|How do we embrace these things... genetically genesplicing in more intelligent messaging, more things that would wake up people, in ways that might affect their life in more positive ways?

This strategy involves packaging meaningful messages deep and personal to his beliefs beneath the veil of an entertaining video game, in the way the Trojans hid deep within the bowels of the wooden horse from [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]].<ref name=\"Trojan Horse Pop\" /> Hence his games touch on elements of \"slavery, globalization, food crisis and animal testing\" in an entertaining but thought-provoking game that doesn't preach to the gamers, yet still contains the messages for those willing to consume them.<ref name=\"Trojan Horse Pop\" /> The challenge now was to do that in a free market society capitalistically driven on growth only, where games with artistic vision are considered too risky to the point of being suicidal industry decisions.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" />\n\nLanning's original plan was for Oddworld Inhabitants to be a \"colossal transmedia endeavour, born of a visionary sense that interactive and non-interactive entertainment would at some point converge, assisted by evolving digital communications.\"<ref name=\"The Future's Odd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/64469/features/the-futures-odd-how-just-add-water-revived-oddworld-and-where-itll-go-next/ |title=The future's Odd: how Just Add Water revived Oddworld, and where it'll go next |publisher=Xbox Magazine |date=2013-10-19 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref> While it was to eventually encompass film and the online world, it would begin with video games because they \"could be a potentially powerful medium for telling great stories\" and because so much American mind share was devoted to video games at the time.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> But his intention was to own his properties and his creations forever, rather than follow the business expectation of licensing characters to the highest bidder. He saw iconic creations like Star Wars, Disney and Pixar, that became \"pied pipers of the most popular characters with noble causes, as a general practice... just becoming the brands on the worst quality health products for new generations... that are being pushed by the largest companies\" and marketed with misinformation about its unhealthiness<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> Instead, Lanning wanted to create characters of high moral integrity and use them to enforce a new licensing model which involved only licensing to companies that use better practices for its employees and for the environment, because \"for creators, some things are more important than money\".<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" />\n\nHe also believes that video games have the power to have a profoundly positive effect on the planet. Right now, the purpose of games to make money and entertain is just the tip of the iceberg. But if video game developers were asked to make games that could:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|teach kids physics by first grade, teach kids to read by this time, to help engineers better understand how the world works, and biologists and scientists understand by creating virtual worlds that don't necessarily have to turn a profit, but have to show improvement in cognitive skills and statistic benefits to society, if that happened tomorrow, what would gaming be like in ten years from now? And that's not even on the table. It's never up for discussion. It's not going to happen under the current way things work here. But we really are still looking at a medium that's just capable of completely kicking ass over all other mediums.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= EP Daily<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" />\n}}\n\nLanning still believes that video games are suffering what has plagued all entertainment industries\u2014an \"unbalanced ratio of Britney Spears-class\" content versus deeper \"Pink Floyd-like\" complexity.\"<ref name=\"Hit List Q&A\" /> But he hopes the 21st century will continue the trend that storytellers like Shakespeare, Pink Floyd and his inspirations Aldous Huxley, George Orwell and HG Wells have used to \"create deeper more meaningful and relevant content that reflects the challenging issues happening in the world around them today\".<ref name=\"More Britney\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/21/4849132/video-game-storytellers-can-learn-from-shakespeare-and-pink-floyd |title=Why video games are more Britney Spears and less Pink Floyd |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-10-21 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> The obstacles preventing them from getting these more meaningful stories out to their audiences, according to Lanning, are \"money, means and the fear of soap box activism\".<ref name=\"More Britney\" /> Sales and marketing departments are more concerned with profit and less with meaningful stories. As a result, the big budget triple-A titles are least likely to risk their profits by releasing content with deeper meaning instead of with tried and true methods of success, because they work in an environment of \"investment versus returns\" dictated by the publishers providing the money they need to make the game. However, if developers can create games that are cheaper and with little or no investment from a publisher, they retain more creative influence on the end product and can then make a game with more meaningful content, instead of what will sell more units.<ref name=\"More Britney\" /> But the danger of making games with these messages is the risk of \"alienating an often jaded userbase through activist ideals\" and making them feel like they are being dictated to by someone on a soap box, instead of entertained way video games have always done.<ref name=\"Trojan Horse Pop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/30/4769188/oddworld-philosophy-of-trojan-horse-pop-lorne-lanning |title=How Oddworld's philosophy of 'trojan horse pop' will hide meaning in games |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> But Lanning believes that the documentary filmmaking industry shows an evolving appetite for reflecting relevant truths that leave audiences with more lasting impressions and value to their lives, hence his method of Trojan Horse pop.<ref name=\"More Britney\" /> And video games can do this the way music and film has, but only if it is led by the independent sector, because they don't have to guarantee high profit margins for investments coming from publishers.\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|When content is deeper and more meaningful, then you can still create highly digestible and widely consumable entertainment products.

When Lanning first entered the industry with ''Abe's Oddysee'' in the mid 90s, developers could only rely on focus groups and market research for feedback; they would only see review scores after release; and stores would not give them information on who was buying their games.<ref name=\"Customer Feedback\">{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/29/oddworld-creator-on-how-customer-feedback-changed-gaming/?sr_source=Twitter |title='Oddworld' creator on how customer feedback changed gaming |publisher=Engadget |date=2016-06-29 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}</ref> But by then, it was too late to allow the audience to contribute to its development.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" /> Today, however, social networking has allowed them to be in constant contact with their audience through the planning and development stages to allow them to make decisions on development, and on which games to create.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" /> When they released a trailer for ''New 'n' Tasty!'' during its development, by the same night, they had received 10,000 responses through Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, by the next day, 20,000 responses, numbers no marketing department could ever generate at the time of ''Abe's Oddysee'' in 1997 with market research or focus groups.<ref name=\"Customer Feedback\" /> \"Content co-creation\" is all about facilitating a conversation between creator and player, which Lanning believes was not possible in the time of distributing at retail outlets,<ref name=\"PlayStation Blogcast\" /> and according to him, is the future of game development because it extends the game beyond the written story.<ref name=\"Clay Sculptures\" /> And it allows players to feel a sense of ownership that they have helped model the very game they have played. \"It's one thing to say, 'Look at this picture of this beautiful baby.' It's another thing to say, 'Look at this picture of ''my'' beautiful baby.' There's a whole different depth of connection and ownership,\" Lanning said. They also discovered that it didn't matter to audiences about the brand going big, but that they targeted more platforms and networks for audiences to play on.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" />\n\nSo the studio polled their audience to find out what kind of game they wanted to play, and found that fans wanted ''Abe's Oddysee'' redone like ''Stranger's Wrath''.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 3\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/26/why-lorne-lanning-went-from-aaa-games-to-indie-and-loudly-loves-it-interview/3/ |title=Why Lorne Lanning went from triple-A games to indie \u2014 and loudly loves it (interview) |publisher=Gamesbeat |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> While the relationship between Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water was symbiotic, with JAW constantly running things by Oddworld Inhabitants via email conversations,<ref name=\"In Odd We Trust\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesabyss.com/in-odd-we-trust-an-interview-with-oddworld-inhabitants/ |title=In Odd We Trust: An Interview with Oddworld Inhabitants |publisher=Games Abyss |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref> Lanning told JAW to ask the audience for input in answering their questions about the game, because they are the ones that will be playing it. The more you engage them in the process, \"that feedback is going to be really, really valuable\" and when they see that you are genuinely listening, they feel like they are being heard and it creates \"deeper more passionate fan bases\".<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> Audiences also had an influence on choosing the next project after ''New 'n' Tasty!'' saying they wanted Exoddus redone in the same way, resulting in what will become ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' in 2017, and the response from the press release showed them that interest in the brand was still very much alive.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" />\n\nAlong with getting the games into the consumers' hands, publishing companies advertise a developer's game to the consumers. And for the first time in Oddworld's time as an independent developer, they have had to address the issue of advertising without the five million dollar marketing campaign that publishers provided them in the past,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vET9uBmQqdU |title= Abe's Oddysee HD New 'n' Tasty!

|publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=2013-07-17 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nWhen YouTube introduced a new Content ID system in December 2013 allowing holders of copyright material to flag content they had not approved to be published on the service, such as Let's Plays, commercial trailers, and screen shots, Oddworld Inhabitants issued a statement on their own website informing fans that they give \"explicit permission to anyone on the service to broadcast using Oddworld games\" without fear of being issued a copyright claim, because \"nothing makes us happier than to see you guys enjoying our games, and it's something we encourage wholeheartedly.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/2013/12/oddworlds-position-on-youtubes-new-content-id-system/ |title=Oddworld's Position On YouTube's New Content ID System |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref> YouTube and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] are platforms that Oddworld Inhabitants take seriously because today, they're more important for game exposure than television, and it's where fans are the most objective, which Lanning believes is important for developers when seeking feedback.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" /> And on Twitch, customer feedback can be watched in real time.<ref name=\"Customer Feedback\" />\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Oddworld Inhabitants launched a competition inviting fans to submit names for five [[Trophies (PS3)|trophies]] to be included on the PlayStation port of the game, with winners announced 14 February to receive a signed game poster, code for the PlayStation platform of their choice, and inclusion in the game's credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/2014/01/contest-name-a-trophy-in-new-n-tasty-win-prizes/ |title=CONTEST: Name Trophies in New 'n' Tasty, Win Ridiculous Prizes |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> None of these things would have happened outside of the digital world. When Lanning is asked how he would encourage new fans to his game, he directs them to the oldest fans of his franchise, because \"they have a certain passion, they've stayed with us... they speak to it better than we do [and] we're not paying them\".<ref name=\"E3 2013 Live Oddworld\" />\n\nBy involving fans so early on in the production of the game, beginning with letting them choose what game the developers would make, and then its title and the design of its cover art, the relationship has encouraged people to offer content for free because they want to see the developers survive, whereas in the past, developers would have to pay for people to contribute voices.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> And by producing a product with enough quality that it creates the kind of brand awareness that mobilises an audience into supporting developers, that product can be financially incentivising enough for big companies like Sony, Apple or Microsoft to support and invest in\u2014the best example being that of Minecraft.<ref name=\"Lanning Kinda Funny\" /> And if developers can get the kind of exposure that comes with that support, but remain independent, then the blockbuster titles of the next generation will come out of the indie space.<ref name=\"Lanning Kinda Funny\" />\n\nThe other important factor that has ensured their revival is the integrity that the Oddworld brand sustained when they first made their video games.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> The Oddworld games were built on millions in funding compared to the current games on portable platforms that are made with so much less.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> The 2D nature of the ''Abe'' games has also helped, according to Lanning, as mobile platforms lend itself well to 2D games, hence there is no judgment towards ''Oddysee'' and ''Exoddus'' for being 2D.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" />\n\nThe games have found success a second time on the digital landscape, due in small part to the [[guerrilla marketing]] possible with today's media, but more importantly because of the brand recognition that came from nurturing their original audience in the late 90s, which Lanning believes has them fortunately ahead of the indie developers pack.<ref name=\"PSNation Interview Gilray Lanning\" /> Said Lanning, \"As long as we don't try to exploit the dollars out of that fanbase in cheap ways... then we should be able to keep growing that fanbase and reigniting it,\" with the goal to be raising enough money to make triple-A titles that are self-funded.\n\nLanning found that the fans that grew up on ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Abe's Exoddus'' in the late 90s are now parents that have children,<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> and when those games became available digitally through Steam and PSN, they saw that their first fans were now turning the games onto their children. In the last quarter of 2012, the 13-year-old Abe games sold 300,000 units (10% of what it sold in its entire run on PC and PS1) via digital distribution through word of mouth alone before any form of marketing.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\n''Stranger's Wrath HD'' sold almost 250,000 units between December 2011 and October 2012 on the PlayStation 3, not including future sales on Steam, whereas the original Xbox version sold 600,000 units in its lifetime.<ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> By March 2014, the entire Oddworld portfolio sold two million units on the digital landscape.<ref name=\"Venture Beat Bet\" /> However, Gilray was acutely aware of how the huge gap in game production can affect Oddworld's ability to keep up with technology unavailable when they were making games. So when remastering ''Stranger'' and ''Munch'', they included features like [[PlayStation Move]], 3D support and online leaderboards.<ref name=\"In Odd We Trust\" />\n\nThe other new lesson to come from the current gaming landscape has been using analytics to understand the behavioral patterns of gamers. Lanning describes analytics as the new religion of the online space and believes the company that has the best learning engine for analytics is [[Zynga]].<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> While he may not like their games, \"when you look at the science of how they are analysing what their audience is doing, there's a reason why they have 170 million users today\u2014larger than the install-base of the entire console market\".<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" />\n\n==Released titles==\nThe developers originally stated that the ''Oddworld'' series would consist of five inter-connected games referred to as the Quintology. Only two of those five games have been produced, while two additional games from the same universe were developed as expansion titles outside of the Quintology. Production on the Quintology's final three games was halted when the company decided to redirect its efforts toward film production. Those plans, too, were shelved. In 2009, a partnership was created with developers [[Just Add Water (company)|Just Add Water]] to continue developing the abandoned video games with Oddworld Inhabitants Inc. becoming the publisher of the titles. In order to raise the money to fund the rest of the Quintology, Just Add Water began by porting the studio's first two titles to new consoles and producing high definition remasters of ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'' and ''Stranger's Wrath''. A high definition rebuild of ''Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee'' subtitled ''New 'n' Tasty!'' was next. Stewart Gilray has confirmed that all five Quintology games are titled Oddworld: X's Oddysee where X is the name of the protagonist.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\">{{cite podcast|url=http://joypadandme.com/2014/01/26/podcast-episode-45-an-odd-world-with-special-guest-stewart-gilray/ |title=PODCAST EPISODE 45: AN ODD WORLD WITH SPECIAL GUEST STEWART GILRAY |website=joypadandme.com |publisher=Joypad And Me|host=Jedi Junkie |date=2014-01-26 |accessdate=2014-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Published by [[GT Interactive]] for [[PlayStation]], [[DOS]] and [[Windows]] platforms, it is the first in their planned five-game Quintology of games set on the fictional planet of Oddworld. The game tells the story of Abe, a happy, ignorant factory worker and the destined savior of his mudokon race.<ref name=Schott>Carr, Diane, David Buckingham, Andrew Burn, Gareth Schott, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSp7uW75TrYC Computer Games: Text, Narrative and Play], Polity</ref> Abe is a lowly floor waxer at RuptureFarms, a meat processing plant run by the evil glukkons on Oddworld's largest continent of Mudos. The plant makes sweet and savory treats by farming and slaughtering the wildlife that roam the rural areas surrounding the plant, and exploits 100 mudokons for slave labor to run their factory. When Abe discovers the glukkons' plan to increase their dwindling profits by using the mudokons in their new tasty treat, he vows to escape the plant and save his 99 friends. Along the way, he meets a spiritual guide that opens his mind to the mudokons' bond with nature and Abe's personal destiny to awaken the powerful mudokon gods and become the prophesied savior who would return his race to their sacred holy lands. The game is a side-scrolling 2D [[platformer]] with lifelike animation on top of photo-realistic backgrounds. Its revolutionary features included the ability to \"chant\" in order to possess and remotely control the bodies of Slig guards to solve puzzles or allow Abe to advance safely; and a feature called gamespeak, the ability for the player to engage in conversation with other mudokons to navigate them to safety. The game was later ported to Gameboy by Saffire under the title ''Oddworld Adventures''.\n\n===''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''===\n{{Main|Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus}}\n\nFollowing the success of ''Abe's Oddysee'', Oddworld temporarily shelved plans for the next game in their Quintology to produce an instant follow up that could capitalize on the popularity of the first game. The resultant spinoff game, ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' was released the following year in 1998, again published by GT Interactive for PlayStation and Windows platforms. A direct sequel to ''Oddysee'', ''Exoddus'' begins immediately after Abe returns from RuptureFarms with his fellow mudokons, receiving a vision from the spirits of his ancestors. They plead for his help in stopping the glukkons from digging up mudokon bones to make the addictive Soulstorm Brew.<ref name=bio>[http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/universe/native/characters/mudokons/ow_abe_bio.html Abe biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720104338/http://oddworld.com/firsttenyears/universe/native/characters/mudokons/ow_abe_bio.html |date=20 July 2006 }}, Official Oddworld Website.</ref> Along the way, Abe rescues more of his mudokon race and learns more about their sacred history, living in harmony with nature and the wildlife.<ref name=\"Robinson, John\">[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9902/04/oddworld/index.html Something strange is brewing in 'Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'], CNN.</ref> Coming so quickly after the previous game, ''Exoddus'' used ''Oddysee'''s game engine, remaining a 2D side-scrolling platformer, albeit adding more, longer levels and extra features. Abe's abilities were expanded upon to include more communication options and wider chant abilities allowing the possession of other species.<ref name=Thomas>Thomas, Maureen, Fran\u00e7ois Penz, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UozK9smjVcC Architectures of Illusion: From Motion Pictures to Navigable Interactive Environments], Intellect Books</ref> Mudokons were also further developed, now having moods that affect Abe's ability to communicate with them and enlist their co-operation.\n\n===''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''===\n{{Main|Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee}}\n\nOddworld Inhabitants' third game, ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'' was the second of their planned five-game Quintology series. Released in 2001 as a direct sequel to their two previous entries, the game was published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] exclusively for the Xbox. Abe returns, but the game introduces a new protagonist in Munch, the last living remnant of the near-extinct, amphibious gabbit creatures. The story again involves Abe embarking on a quest to free the weak from the tyranny of the powerful capitalist creatures that exploit them for their own gain. Players assume the dual roles of Abe and Munch as they team up to escape the vicious Vykkers who harvested the gabbits in order to profit from their eggs\u2014a delicacy on Oddworld\u2014and ultimately destroy the Vykker's Labs. The game marks the series' introduction into 3D environments, though retaining its roots as a platformer. It is also the first game to introduce a second protagonist, allowing the player to switch between Abe and Munch to take advantage of abilities exclusive to each character. Also pivotal was the expansion of elements that were only touched on in their two previous games, such as the ability to \"create characters and use them as allies to attack, defend and solve work problems in the world.\"<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\" /> Other changes include new chanting features, the ability for Abe to pick up objects or people, and power ups that affect gameplay.\n\n===''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath''===\n{{Main|Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath}}\n\nVeering away from the Quintology a second time, Oddworld Inhabitants' fourth game was ''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath'', published for the Xbox in 2005 by [[Electronic Arts]]. The first Oddworld game to be entirely independent of the Abe series, ''Stranger's Wrath'' is set in the Wild West of Oddworld and follows a bounty hunter known only as the Stranger, one of the last remaining \"steef\" on Oddworld, as he collects bounties for capturing outlaws in order to save enough \"moolah\" for a life-saving operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/60957/features/oddworld-strangers-wrath-why-oddworlds-only-fps-deserves-a-second-chance/ |title=Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath \u2013 why Oddworld's only FPS deserves a second chance |publisher=Xbox Magazine |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref> The game continues the 3D gameplay introduced by ''Munch's Oddysee'' and switches between first person perspective for shooting, and third person perspective for long range running, platform jumping and melee combat.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/technology/circuits/17game.html?_r=1&ex=1109307600&en=c4214af930777332&ei=5070&oref=slogin Underneath It All, Substance Sells,] ''New York Times''.</ref> It also moves away from Oddworld's reliance on puzzles in favor of an action-adventure style with elements of role playing. Its prominent new features included \"live ammunition\", where the player can use various in-game creatures and projectiles for differing effects; and the ability to use the game's money system to purchase various items and weapon upgrades.\n\n===''Oddboxx''===\nIn 2009, Lorne Lanning announced plans to make an Oddworld [[Online distribution|digital download]] package exclusively for PC to contain ''Abe's Oddysee'', ''Abe's Exoddus'', and for the first time on the platform, ''Munch's Oddysee'' and ''Stranger's Wrath''. When Oddworld Inhabitants unveiled their re-designed website on 4 November 2010, they declared the then in-development package would be titled ''Oddboxx''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/?p=249 |title=The Oddboxx &#124; Oddworld Inhabitants |publisher=Oddworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref> The European and U.S. prices of the ''Oddboxx'' were revealed on 14 December<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/?p=271 |title=Oddboxx \u2013 Euro and U.S. Prices.

The game remained a side-scrolling platformer, but has done away with the original's flip screen presentation in favour of smooth continuous scrolling and a dynamic camera for zooming in and out based on the movements of the player and the scenery. The story is completely identical to ''Oddysee'' and new FMV sequences have been added to recreations of the originals to further illustrate the plot. The soundtrack too has been recreated from scratch, with additional pieces added. ''New 'n' Tasty!'' debuted on PS4 in July 2014, as part of an exclusive release with Sony in exchange for giving Oddworld Inhabitants their own booth at E3 in 2013, and centre stage at Sony's 2013 E3 presentation.<ref name=\"Venture Beat Bet\" /> Versions for Linux, Microsoft Windows and OS X were released on 25 February 2015 while the Xbox One version was released on 27 March 2015.

He said that the game is on target to be released in 2017 and it's going to be a platform-based game like ''New 'n' Tasty'' is. He also said that some Youtubers and their composer, Michael Bross will be doing some voice-over work for the game.\n\nIn September 2016 at the [[EGX (expo)|EGX Expo]], Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty's designer Matt Glanville said that Oddworld: Soulstorm is going to be a bigger version of Abe's Exoddus. There will be some areas and game mechanics that were from Exoddus and some new areas from Oddworld.

The story is set in a rural land resembling [[Afghanistan]]<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> far from the continent of Mudos where the first four Oddworld games were based, inspired by the \"United States propaganda approach\" of pretending to free the region, but really wanting to \"rob it and slaughter it and leave it as rubble\".<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> The invaders are a foreign species resembling an Eastern European<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> or \"Russian mafia\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> whose genetics include traces of feline DNA. Fangus' history reveals canine DNA, allowing for Lanning's desire to \"play off of that dog versus cat theme\" that he's always wanted to visit\u2014\"one of those dynamic, eternal battles... myths that lie deep in our history of civilization... like good versus evil.\"<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> The invaders have turned this \"beautiful landscape into meth labs,\"<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> \"whilst the dogs find themselves fighting for scraps in a war-torn region.\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> Fangus is a shepherd who is directly affected by the invasion, \"finding out he's only got so long, and the circumstances that have [led] him to this position means he's going to have to fight,<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> following a similar journey to that of the [[Maximus Decimus Meridius|Roman general]] in [[Gladiator (2000 film)|''Gladiator'']].<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" />\n\nOddworld Inhabitants delayed reacting to a rumor about the game which caused many to consider the development the playing of an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools' Day prank]]. In a June 2009 issue of Game Informer, Lorne Lanning officially spoke about the game, revealing concept art and story details, and plans to distribute the game digitally. A Mature rating by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] was expected due to dark tones and themes throughout the game. [[Majesco Entertainment]] was expected to publish the game for the Xbox before it was canceled when they failed to come to agreements with Sherry McKenna and Lorne Lanning. In a 9 May 2011 FAQ, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative confirmed ''Fangus Klot'' will be in future plans following ''The Hand Of Odd'' and ''Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!''<ref name=\"Oddworld Inhabitants\"/> and Lanning further expressed his desire to make the game, though financing it is the obstacle.<ref name=\"Tell it like it is\" /><ref>Lanning, L.

Production began in January 1995 with the original title \"SoulStorm\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> before GT Interactive changed the name in September 1996 and released it on 19 September 1997.<ref name=\"Abe's Oddysee Name Change\">Ballistic Publishing, ''The Art of Oddworld: The First Ten Years 1994\u20132004'', page 99</ref> The culmination of Lorne Lanning's unique artistic design and socioeconomic themes, the game proved to be a commercial and critical hit,<ref name=\"Oddysee Review Gamespot\">{{cite web |url=http://au.gamespot.com/oddworld-abes-oddysee/reviews/oddworld-abes-oddysee-review-2543511/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411001302/http://au.gamespot.com/oddworld-abes-oddysee/reviews/oddworld-abes-oddysee-review-2543511/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-04-11 |title=Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee Review |publisher=Gamespot |date=1997-12-08 |accessdate=2013-03-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/108/ |title=Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee |publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming |date=1999-08-03 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/198224-oddworld-abes-oddysee/index.html |title=Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee |publisher=Gamerankings.com  |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref><ref name=\"Stick It To The Man\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/10/02/oddworld-abes-oddysee-interview-stick-it-to-the-man/ |title=Oddworld Abe's Oddysee interview: stick it to the man|publisher=VG24/7 |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref> sold 3.5 million units,<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\">{{cite web|url=http://oddworldlibrary.net/blog/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning-again/ |title=Nathan interviews Lorne Lanning again |publisher=Oddblog |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref> made $180 million<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> and won almost 30 prestigious industry and print media awards.<ref name=\"Abe's Oddysee Awards\">Ballistic Publishing, ''The Art of Oddworld: The First Ten Years 1994\u20132004'', page 98</ref><ref name=\"Oddworld Awards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/awards/ |title=Awards |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> The game tells the story of Abe, one of 100 mudokon creatures enslaved by industrialist glukkon creatures in a meat-processing plant called RuptureFarms on the planet Oddworld.<ref name=\"IGN Oddysee Review\">{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/1997/09/23/oddworld-abes-oddysee |title= Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee |publisher=IGN |date=1997-09-22 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref> When the glukkons find that the wildlife used to create their meat products are becoming extinct, they decide to use the mudokons in their next product, forcing Abe to escape the plant and rescue his friends.<ref name=\"Oddysee Review Gamespot\" />\n\nDescribed as \"mysticism versus consumerism with a mega dose of twisted humor,\"<ref name=\"Abe's Oddysee Description\">Ballistic Publishing, ''The Art of Oddworld: The First Ten Years 1994\u20132004'', page 53</ref> the story represented beliefs deep and personal to creator Lorne Lanning\u2014that \"great art reflects back on us not necessarily what we want to see, but what we need to face.\"<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> For Lanning, those beliefs infused his characterisation of the planet Oddworld, with ''Abe's Oddysee'' touching on just a small aspect of the larger picture that was the entire planet. His idea was for the theme of Oddworld to be \"heavily woven with the dark side of globalization, the dark side of the multi-national fallout upon the human condition\" and for his games to touch on examples of those themes, in the case of ''Abe's Oddysee'', capitalism, third-world exploitation, the environment and the fast food industry with respect to the plight of the diamond miners in South Africa and the De Beers cartel that dominate diamond trading.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> Lanning disliked \"what [capitalism] did to the little guy,\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> and \"wanted to create a meaningful dark reflection of our dysfunctional world, wrapped up in a fantasy world, where we could talk about the craziness of our capitalism, but with a funny bone approach.\"<ref name=\"Reddit\" /> And this anti-capitalist view infused the deeper meaning of ''Abe's Oddysee'' as the socio-economic element of the story was set amongst the lower class \"slaving away in unsafe conditions, unwillingly bending to the will of corporate suits... to earn a few bucks for a day's worth of grueling, often unrewarding work\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_oddysee_1 |title=Editorial: Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee |publisher=gog.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> The protagonist fighting back against his oppressors, the Glukkons, represented Lanning's desire for people in the real world to fight back against the \"abominable behavior of the world's most greedy multi-national corporations,\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> characterised by \"caricatures of CEOs, all power-suits and cigars.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sosogay.co.uk/2013/retro-gaymer-oddworld-abes-oddysee/ |title=Retro Gaymer\u2026 Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee |publisher=So So Gay |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530234855/http://sosogay.co.uk/2013/retro-gaymer-oddworld-abes-oddysee/ |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Glukkons play a minor role in the gameplay of ''Abe's Oddysee'', and are only seen in the game's cutscenes. This was intentional, as Lanning wanted the primary antagonist to be the RuptureFarms factory itself. \"The corporation is above and beyond any of its executives or employees\u2014or slaves. So by making [players] defeat RuptureFarms as the end boss... we thought it would add a bigger sense of climax.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> This story was important to Lanning because he feels \"it's the artist's role to create new myths that are relevant to the changing times of our world, [and] to bring some shining direction to our more troubling challenges.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" />\n\nThe game introduced what would become staple features of Oddworld games. In an era of gaming when protagonists were typically muscle-bound, imposing and carrying a weapon, Abe was the complete antithesis of that.<ref name=\"Unlikely Game Heroes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-7-unlikeliest-badasses-gaming/?page=2 |title=The Top 7\u2026 Unlikeliest badasses in gaming |publisher=Games Radar |date=2011-10-03 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Game Revolution Exoddus Review\" />\nLanning said he wanted his protagonists to represent the everyman, the average chump, so they're not the \"steroided out, muscle-bound heroes you want to be, they're the poor schumucks you actually are,\" so as to better symbolize the Average Joe that is exploited unknowingly by corporations.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Oddworld's senior animator Scott Easley said Abe is \"not a brainiac, he's not a jack of all trades, he's not a master anything, he's a goofbag... but he's indicative of a much greater world that's out there.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> Lanning explained the process of designing and characterising Abe involved an American meat institute promo, Pakistani ''chuhas'', and \"classic American misinformation\" given to \"seriously troubled production designers.\"<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Being a character that Sherry McKenna described as one that \"people could really identify with, not the character we'd like to be,\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> Abe couldn't carry a weapon. \"The biggest problem was, if Abe could carry a gun, then general gaming behavior means that he's going to start solving all his problems with a gun, and that was not the Abe we wanted to create.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> Instead, Lanning wanted the hero to be empathetically driven, and he believed \"It was a message that was really ready to be heard by the executive class in the industry\".<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> The only problem was that video games did not have mechanics to suit a character who fought with emotion and speech instead of guns. So they developed those mechanics, in the form of gamespeak and possession.<ref name=\"Lorne Interview Video\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOgUQxiNAnI |title=Interview Lorne Lanning |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref> Possession came from Lanning's desire to make Abe's mudokon creatures [[Shamanism|Shamanic]] by the way of being connected to the spiritual world\u2014an antithesis to the antagonist Glukkons who were industrialists.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> This gave Abe the ability to chant in order to possess the mind and body of Slig guards, using them to sneak past areas undetected, carry out tasks he could not do himself, or kill with their machine guns.\n\nThe second staple of Oddworld games, and what would be Abe's other weapon\u2014gamespeak\u2014was a feature of the game that allowed Abe to communicate with other Mudokons in order to instruct them to safety and rescue. Lanning described gamespeak as \"a way to try to have meaningful verbal action that would also create a closer connection... to our characters... a necessary ingredient designed to make you care more for the Mudokons you were supposed to rescue.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Oddysee\" /> What Lanning found throughout the history of games was that they mostly followed the same paradigm:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|Aggression over time equals rewards. It doesn't matter if you're shooting anything or bouncing on their heads, it's all the same concept. And so we thought, if we could change the paradigm to be empathy equals rewards over time, but still not sacrifice the things that are fun about action and adventure, then we could start to get a little more heart going, and that might start to do things like pick up on the female demographic, get more women interested in games. But it meant evolving the video game character. What does a classic entertainment character do and what does a video game character do? Classic characters talk, and they listen, and they communicate and have relationships with other characters. \n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= GDC 2000<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" />\n}}\n\nAnd by giving Abe the ability to communicate and feel emotions for the characters he saved or lost, it made him \"the guy that in our hearts, we identify with... why we care so much for him.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> One of the [[Game engine|engines]] created and trademarked by Oddworld Inhabitants for ''Oddysee'' was the Aware Lifeforms in Virtual Entertainment (A.L.I.V.E) engine. Lanning views it as \"a conceptual theme more than a technological evolution\" that aimed to create virtual characters with believable personalities and visible awareness because, \"if characters feel more compelling and self aware\u2014then we increase the possibility of engaging our audience emotionally.\"<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> Abe was also given an infinite number of lives because \"I wanted you to never give up. No matter how fucking sucky you were, if you stuck with it, you'd get there. And that's life, man.\"<ref name=\"Vice Enduring Abe\" />\n\nWhen ''Abe's Oddysee'' was released in Japan, two changes were made to the game's visuals, namely during the [[Full motion video|FMV]] sequences. The first was due to the graphic image of a severed mudokon head atop a stick in the introductory movie depicting the new \"Mudokon Pops\" item about to be marketed by the Glukkons, shocking Abe into his escape and thus beginning the game. In the Japanese release, the image of the Mudokon Pops was changed to resemble a cartoonlike [[Ice pop|Popsicle]] with eyes and a mouth, considered a \"happier\" image by Oddworld Inhabitants.<ref name=\"Mudokon Pops Change\">Ballistic Publishing, ''The Art of Oddworld: The First Ten Years 1994\u20132004'', page 58</ref> It was not until 2011 that Lanning revealed just why the image was changed for Japanese audiences. A week before press was to begin in Japan to market the game, a Japanese middle-school student murdered a peer, severed his head, and hung it on the fence of a school. Lanning saw that this was \"very, very distressful to the country of Japan that this happened... so they said that it would probably be a good idea to change it. We were asked and we weren't stupid, so we complied.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> The altered image remained in the sequel released in all territories. Said Lanning, \"I never liked the first one. But that was just what came out from the artists and I... try to give [them] some room and not change everything to my liking.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\nThe second change made to the final Japanese version concerned the appearance of Abe's four-fingered hand. The developers found that in Japan, a hand with four fingers was common amongst \"a subclass of meat packing workers that were typically looked down upon in their society.\"<ref name=\"Oddworld FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/about/faq/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> Over time, the displaying of a four-fingered hand gesture towards another came to be seen as an insult implying that they were subclass. To use that in a form of entertainment could \"very likely end up in legal battles with a vociferous pressure group\" who likened the insult to that of [[Nazism|Nazis]] making [[Jews]] wear the [[Yellow badge|yellow star]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name=\"Oddworld FAQ\" /> Lanning understood how it might have been distasteful to ignore that part of Japanese culture by leaving Abe with his four fingers, especially considering a large part of the game's setting was in a meat-packing plant. But when he discovered that the group would accept a payment of one million dollars to keep the insulting image in the game, \"that becomes extortion, rather than a principle.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> As a result, Oddworld Inhabitants decided to let the pressure groups have their way by changing the image to give Abe three fingers, so that the developers could maintain their morality in not paying off extortionists. The irony of the controversy was that it was an example of life imitating art, as in the game, Abe was the representative of a subclass of species \"discriminated against for being who he was... because they don't like his kind here.\"<ref name=\"Oddworld FAQ\" />\n\n====''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' (1998)====\n\nThe success of ''Oddysee'' required Oddworld Inhabitants to make a sequel, which forced them to break from their original plan of a five game \"Quintology\" with the next game intended to be ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''. In an example of life imitating art, the corporate machine of Oddworld's publishers, GT Interactive, pressured the studio to make a new game for the PlayStation by Christmas 1998.<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/editorial_oddworld_abes_exoddus |title=Editorial: Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |publisher=gog.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> Lorne Lanning refused to make ''Munch'' for PlayStation because he wanted that game to use 3D environments and he felt the hardware was not good enough to handle that.<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" /> The short turnaround between games meant Lanning had to think fast about what game to produce. In order to complete a game in nine months, he decided on a direct sequel to ''Abe's Oddysee'' using the same engine, added improvements to gamespeak, a [[quicksave]] system,<ref name=\"Exoddus Adventure Classic Gaming\" /> more cinematic sequences and even more intricate backgrounds.<ref name=\"Game Revolution Exoddus Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/oddworld-abes-exoddus |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus Review |publisher=Game Revolution |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> Lanning said his studio \"killed ourselves getting ''Abe's Exoddus'' done in nine months\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" /> and McKenna reiterated, \"it was hell... not fun... we got it done in nine months because that's what you're supposed to do\u2014deliver on time.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 1\" /> A bonus game outside of the original Quintology,<ref name=\"Exoddus Adventure Classic Gaming\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/274/ |title=Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus |publisher=Adventure Classic Gaming |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> ''Abe's Exoddus'' released in 1998 for PlayStation and PC, continuing the story where ''Oddysee'' left off using elements that were left out of its predecessor due to time constraints. Abe is sent on a quest by his deceased ancestors to destroy the mega factories that produce Soulstorm Brew\u2014a product made from the bones of dead mudokons, and rescue 300 of his kind, discovering an even deeper connection to his spiritual past along the way. And like the previous game, \"it speaks about hope, it speaks about changing for the better, it speaks about not being beaten down by the big guy.\"<ref name=\"Icons Part 2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_fnhF1XvGI |title=Icons G4 \u2013 Oddworld \u2013 Part 2 of 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Exoddus'' may not have been in the initial plan, Lanning believes the bonus game worked because they wanted the Oddworld universe to be a franchise with infinite stories:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|Our idea for Oddworld was to birth a rich universe of relevant material with endearing characters, one that we could reflect those issues that we felt most deeply about ... [and then] convert them into interactive entertainment. If we did it right, there was no reason why the universe we had created couldn\u2019t tell infinite stories. Much like Star Wars.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= gog.com<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" />\n}}\n\nSo while the Quintology was the core focus of Oddworld Inhabitants, bonus games in the same universe were not unwelcome.\n\nOne of the adjustments made for ''Exoddus'' was the increase in humor compared to ''Oddysee''. While the dark themes of [[Industrialisation|industrialization]], [[Exploitation fiction|exploitation]] and [[capitalism]] were still present, Lanning felt they needed to be offset by more humor. Some of that came in the form of the added ability to possess Abe's own farts and use them as explosives. \"We believe in laughs... they make for good entertainment... and it made sense with our super dark themes to give them a lighter heart with more dysfunctional things to do.\"<ref name=\"Editorial Abe's Exoddus\" />\n\n====''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'' (2001)====\n\nThe studio's third game was ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'', a 3D platform game developed with their upgraded A.L.I.V.E 2 engine<ref name=\"Oddworld Fact Sheet\">{{cite web|url=http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/oddworld.com/firsttenyears/oddworld/company/ow_keyfacts.shtml |title=Oddworld Fact Sheet |publisher=Oddworld Library |date=October 2004 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> and published by Infogrames exclusively for the [[Microsoft]] Xbox console. It was the studio's first foray into the 3D gaming landscape. Lanning wanted to raise the bar for the performance of computer graphics in his games and required a larger output from a console, and found the Xbox was the only one capable of his expectations for the game.<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\" />\n\nAbe returns, this time to assist Munch, the last of the gabbit species on all of Oddworld. His species has been fished to extinction by the Vykkers because their eggs are a delicacy marketed as \"gabbiar\" for the dominant species on the planet, and Munch seeks to find the last known can of gabbiar eggs in order to revive his species. Like Abe, Munch was the embodiment of the \"disturbing, sad reality that's happening in our world today [turned] into a character that people like\" in the dysfunctional 21st century.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Where Disney \"won the 20th century, that's not the future, because kids just don't dig that anymore, we're dealing with different kids... it's a dysfunctional world... if we can embody dysfunctional characters that are really endearing, then we think that's what people are really going to connect with.\"<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Munch's conceptualisation came from hundreds of design concepts based on combining imagery of cats in [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] medical labs and facial cream testing divisions with images of rabbits used in pharmaceutical testing and the \"pure evil\" of U.S. radiation experiments on unwitting elderly citizens seeking medical assistance.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> The theme of species [[extinction]] came from Lanning's experiences as a child growing up, fishing on the [[Connecticut]] river and watching species of fish literally die out due to acid rain and factories built nearby.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> He wanted Munch to embody loneliness and loss to hit the heart strings of the audience,<ref name=\"Icons Part 2\" /> and as with Abe, he begins the game at the \"conceptual position of biggest loser, the most downtrodden, hopeless possible position\" because \"the Oddworld series is all about big, corporate bullies picking on the little guy,\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> and Lanning wanted \"every hero we built on Oddworld [to] come out of that soil,\" so his story was again couched in \"the dark side of globalisation\" that would be the basis of all Oddworld stories:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|so, I knew for Abe I wanted the food crisis and the plight of the third world completely exploited labour to be centre stage. But I also knew that in this universe [...] I wanted to be able to say that later on we\u2019re going to take a flight, say this far away, and we\u2019ll land somewhere else and then we\u2019ll focus on the animal testing victim, the ultra-last guy you would like to be, the lab-rat, who has nothing going on you know, so that was ''Munch\u2019s Oddysee''.\" \n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= Katzenjammer Records<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" />\n}}\n\nThe development of ''Munch's Oddysee'' came after the decision by Oddworld Inhabitants to shift from the PC and PlayStation One platforms to Microsoft's new Xbox console. While the fans responded with hate mail,<ref name=\"Icons Part 2\" /> Lanning explained it was both a technological decision, and a survival decision for his company. On the technological front, the studio began developing the game for the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], but had two problems\u2014the \"unfriendly development environment of the hardware\" made it difficult to program for, and the quality of animation was not as good as Lanning wanted it, relative to how much they were spending.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> However, Lanning saw that the Xbox had the superior graphics capabilities he required to produce the game.<ref name=\"The Future's Odd\" /> It could withstand multiple dozen characters moving and interacting on screen at the same time in the quality of animation they wanted, and with an evolving environmental landscape in the background.<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeySzikrGK8 |title=Xbox Interview \u2013 Lorne Lanning (Oddworld Inhabitants) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}</ref> \"Only Xbox gives us the graphical muscle and intense digital sound to unleash our creative juices and allow us to bring the imaginary world and rich characters of Oddworld to life,\" said Lanning.<ref name=\"Microsoft Oddworld Deal\" /> For development purposes, the game was made to run on a PC, and being that the Xbox was billed as the PC in a box, the change made sense.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> And Microsoft's paradigm of being a console for the entire family fit perfectly with their own view of their studio.<ref name=\"Remaking a Legend\" /> Microsoft also personally asked Lanning what he wanted a possible console to include before they even begun development on the Xbox, and when he saw the system that they built had included a lot of what he requested, he could see that the development of ''Munch'' was now possible.<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\" />\n\nBut the decision to move to Microsoft was as much about his company surviving as it was about the Xbox being the only console to withstand the technological advancements of ''Munch's Oddysee''. Rumours that they were paid to jump to Microsoft were false.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> With Oddworld's publishers, GT Interactive, about to be sold, Lanning heard from other developers that its buyer, Infogrames, was cutting the budgets of its titles to three million dollars, and for his new game to be projected as costing ten million dollars with a studio operating between 500 and 700 thousand dollars a month, Lanning realised, \"this is just not going to work... and that's just common practice in capitalism\".<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> The game couldn't be made under that condition, so they needed to find a new publisher, which was when Microsoft expressed interest in publishing their games, but under the condition that they release ''Munch'' exclusively for the Xbox.<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> It was a time where money was as important as ever, because unlike the current generation of gaming, developers were not given the tools to build games for the Xbox and PS2; they had to build their own tools first, at a great expense, and wanting ''Munch'''s story to be better, while maintaining the soul of ''Abe's Oddysee'' and the quality of the Oddworld brand as their mascot had to compete with globally recognised icons like [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] and [[Lara Croft]], Lanning's company was left with no other option but to choose the console that could withstand its new technologies and afford to lend them the money required to keep it alive in the industry, even if it meant the fans on other platforms would not have access to the game.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> On 23 October 2000, Microsoft announced the signing of a deal with Infogrames, securing exclusive rights to publishing and distributing the next four Oddworld Inhabitants titles, beginning with ''Munch's Oddysee'' the following year.<ref name=\"Microsoft Oddworld Deal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-secures-exclusive-worldwide-rights-to-publish-oddworld-games-for-xbox-75154917.html |title=Microsoft Secures Exclusive Worldwide Rights to Publish 'Oddworld' Games For Xbox |publisher=PR Newswire |date=2000-10-23 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> Lanning expressed his regret at leaving the PC platform, but Microsoft refused to agree to a PC version of the game, and \"unless you're going to pay for [games] yourself... you have to work with partners\" who place constraints on products.<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" />\n\nLanning described ''Munch's Oddysee'' as the project that has him the least satisfied. He took responsibility for the game's faults in acknowledging that he was immature, couldn't handle the pressure that went with managing a larger group of 75 developers and was too over-demanding for what became unrealistic goals.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> Lanning later explained in 2006 that video game developers were being held back creatively by the race to develop newer technologies, a fact that affected the production of ''Munch'' because of the change from 2D to 3D that was demanded by the market of the new Xbox.<ref name=\"Consumer Feelings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/videogames-do-not-reflect-the-feelings-of-consumers-says-lanning |title=Videogames do not reflect the feelings of consumers, says Lanning |publisher=Games Industry International |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> The team working on ''Munch's Oddysee'' was the same team that produced ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Exoddus'', and thus they had no experience in 3D game development.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> In the case of the 2D Abe games, the backgrounds were paintings processed into sprites, pre-rendered and photo retouched, allowing them to add much more detail that wasn't possible in the 3D environment of ''Munch's Oddysee''. Three months from release, the team realised that development was not going to be complete in time, so \"four or five\" new programmers were brought in and replaced most of the development team, who re-wrote the entire game in nine months.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> As for the increase in humor and its \"cartoony\" style, Lanning explained that Microsoft thought of the Oddworld franchise as its ''Super Mario Bros.''.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\nGilray revealed the failure of Munch left the team heartbroken.<ref name=\"Remaking a Legend\" /> Lanning felt that they, and in particular he, under-delivered on the promise of this new game, and for the first time since before ''Abe's Oddysee'', he felt a sense of vulnerability in the industry.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> It was a \"turbulent time in the industry\" with publishers going in and out of business, budgets rising and publishers and developers still learning to manage the changes,\" but the biggest factor that worried Lanning was the exposure brought about by Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console.

IGN described the new elements as a welcome change that showed the Oddworld franchise and Lorne Lanning's ability as a designer had the ability to adapt and evolve with the times after what it described as the failure of ''Munch's Oddysee''.<ref name=\"IGN Stranger Review P1\" /> The last of the game's new elements concerned the live ammunition made available to the player. Lanning explained that he wanted to give fans a new reason to enjoy a first-person shooter that went beyond the simple choice of \"do I shoot 'em in the knee or do I shoot 'em in the head,\" so the ammunition within the game came in the form of living creatures possessing their own AI, meaning each would respond differently and cause a unique effect when shot from the player's crossbow.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> The change in setting and style also allowed for a different kind of storytelling, as it begins with a steady pace of Stranger bounty hunting to save \"moolah\" to pay for lifesaving surgery before evolving \"into a touching tale of redemption that complements Abe's own adventures\" in a shift that increases the game's drama and pace in the final hours.<ref name=\"Stranger's Second Chance\" /> During development, there were tests to add multiplayer to the game, which would have been another first for the franchise, but that never eventuated.<ref name=\"Wrath of the Wild\" />\n\nBut some of the traditional Oddworld elements that originally made the brand unique returned. Most notably, the artificial intelligence of Oddworld's species, as governed by their A.L.I.V.E. game engine, evolved from the ''Munch'' iteration to create a more \"believable personality and visible awareness\".<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> For example, how the player treats the local townsfolk, Clakkerz, dictates how they in turn treat the player. \"They will hide if you hurt them and... will also help you out if are nice about it...

He explained that when they developed their first game, the sales expectation was only half of what they were able to deliver, but for the second game, the sales expectation was almost twice as much as what they could deliver, and for the third and fourth games, the sales expectations again increased while the actual sales further decreased.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> But he explained that the reason for their diminishing successes were due to what he refers to as FUBARS\u2014elements beyond the control of the developers, but influence the production, distribution and publishing of the games\u2014that begun very low during the development of their first game but increased by up to five times as much by the time the fourth game was being developed:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|In the financial space, they don't talk about how many games got lost in the distribution company's warehouse when commercials were running.

And then the financial crash caused a lot of financing troubles in the United States.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= GameCityNights<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" />\n}}\n\nWhen the studio decided to make the ''Citizen Siege'' film, they had a $40\u201360 million budget<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> and were given the green light as an R-rated CG animated feature, they went into the early stages of development.<ref name=\"Lost Oddworld Projects\" /> But the [[global financial crisis]] \"changed the terms in Hollywood [and] greatly reduced the chance of success\".<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> Publishers became even more risk-averse and Lanning realised it was going to be an \"up-hill battle\" to get the movie off the ground.<ref name=\"Lost Oddworld Projects\" /> Being a smaller company affected by the financial constraints more than bigger game developers, Lanning decided to put ''Citizen Siege'', \"Wage Wars\" and all other associated projects from this era on hold. However, his partner Sherry McKenna said the abandonment of ''Citizen Siege'' was the result of \" 'clear differences' with a third party\" that has not yet been identified.<ref name=\"Oddysee, Exoddus, And Wrath\" />\n\nThe following year, Lanning found his Oddworld Inhabitants company returning to where it all began\u2014video games. While his work on the Quintology did cease after ''Munch's Oddysee'', Lanning stood by his claim when Oddworld ceased producing video games that he denied ending game production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spong.com/feature/10109288/Interview-Lorne-Lanning-sets-the-record-straight-only-on-SPOnG-com |title= Interviews// Lorne Lanning sets the record straight only on SPOnG.com |publisher=Spong |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> This proved true when their newest collaborators\u2014[[Just Add Water (company)|Just Add Water]]\u2014announced they were working with Oddworld Inhabitants.\n\n====\"Oddworld\" film====\nLorne Lanning says that he and Sherry would love nothing more than to make an Oddworld film. Instead of writing the Abe stories as games, he wrote them as films and with deep character development because games were supposed to be just the launching pad for the property that is Oddworld, which would then feed into movies when the technology became more powerful and the CG cheaper.<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" /> Separate from the Citizen Siege project but utilising the same machinima technology, the studio halted development before shopping the concept around because the 2008 global financial crisis meant no film publisher would take a risk on them for a $30\u201340 million project, and Lanning believes \"Hollywood is a disaster right now\".<ref name=\"Katzenjammer Interview\" />\n\n====Xmobb by Oddmob, Inc.====\nWhile Citizen Siege and its associated projects are on hold, Lanning maintains that he wants to tell those stories, but \"that I'm going to have to pay for it myself. And that's part of what the new business is about.\"<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> That new venture, called Xmobb, was created by Lorne Lanning and his longtime business partner, Oddworld co-founder and CEO Sherry McKenna, along with Daniel Goldman (co-founder of the [[Total Entertainment Network]]) in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> Xmobb was described as offering social networking with video and gaming services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=112318370 |title=Company Overview of Xmobb, Inc.|publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe business came about when Lanning saw that the human attention span was being spent on [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] more than on any other platform.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> Originally, he believed the most important thing in the video game industry was to build your own intellectual property, but he learned the newest IP was \"people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_IAP8304 |title=Massive Concepts in the Department of Art |publisher=SXSW |date=2011-03-13 |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828211739/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_IAP8304 |archivedate=28 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His plan was to build a space where \"cultures [are] more connected to more passion points\" like friends, shows, hobbies etc. and where they can all be facilitated without anyone or anything being left out.<ref name=\"PlayStation Blogcast\" /> Rather than telling audiences to invest their time in an IP created by someone else, Lanning looked at the relationships people were enjoying and the media they were sharing:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|On Facebook, every hour, 150 years of linear video is being shared between people. Every hour. Every day, YouTube is serving two billion videos. Now, two billion videos served is more than all the networks and all the cable companies combined have served in their lifetime.

This trust was very important in Lanning's view because it demonstrated the return of something that had been lost over the years:\n\n{{centered pull quote|No matter what side of the fence you live on; right, left, religious, atheist, this party, that party, we can all agree on one thing\u2014we've all been screwed by the shitbags that are running things. As a by-product, trust is a new currency, simply because it's been decimated. We don't trust corporations, we don\u2019t trust governments, we don't trust anything anymore. Say, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] is coming out with a new movie, they'll have a 200-million-dollar campaign about it, but you and me probably couldn't give a shit about it. But if you told me 'I saw this movie and it's awesome. You've just got to see it', then I\u2019m going to go see that movie. You had more weight and more value on my impression than 200 million dollars from Paramount ever could, because there's no trust. Trust is in the relationships and it's the new currency.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= OddBlog<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n}}\n\nLanning's idea was a \"space where people [can] gather en-masse to watch the same content, with people they know who are already watching together\" in \"virtual theatres\" created by anyone under any theme, interest or topic while others gather to watch and contribute content in a constant stream.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" /> He thought of this gathering as the video game equivalent of the [[Super Bowl]]\u2014millions of people gathering together in support of something they care about or something they want to fight for.<ref name=\"PlayStation Blogcast\" /> By giving anyone with a computer the opportunity to share information with people all over the world in realtime, viewers would be able to see what is really going on in the world and begin to trust each other, as opposed to what they are being told by a \"corporate funded media landscape that has its own agenda that is anything but democratic in nature [and] a massive misinformation machine that serves [[Wall Street]] and the [[White House]].\"<ref name=\"Lanning Bio\" /> It was Lanning's goal to use this new trust to enlighten the world to what is really going on. He revisited the topic during the issue of Microsoft's DRM policy after the launch of the Xbox One, saying \"companies should focus more on building brand trust and allowing the audience to filter who is a good guy and who's bad... that's what social networks and forums deal with [and] the more a company can build trust, the better they seem to do.\"<ref name=\"Forbes Xbox DRM Issue\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2013/06/19/oddworld-inhabitants-founder-lorne-lanning-believes-microsoft-will-right-xbox-one-ship/ |title=Oddworld Inhabitants Founder Lorne Lanning Believes Microsoft Will Right Xbox One Ship |work=Forbes |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}</ref>\n\nLanning stressed that this new business venture was not about trying to make money for money's sake, nor to make a 20\u201330 million dollar Oddworld title that would compete on the market with 60\u2013100 million dollar games.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> First and foremost, the idea was to \"facilitate a way for people to come together and share in realtime, faster and faster, [so] we'll get enlightened faster as well.\" with the added bonus that \"if we do [Xmobb] right, I get to finance the [Citizen Siege] movies myself and then they're not going to be compromised\" by big publishers.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\nIn August 2011, Lanning said the launch was a few months away, with patents filed under the business name Oddmobb, Inc.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/patents/assignee/oddmobb-inc/ |title=Oddmobb, Inc.|publisher=Patentdocs |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> but at the Eurogamer Expo in September 2012, he revealed the failure of Xmobb.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> The associated websites have since been shut down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xmobb.com/ |title=Xmobb |publisher=Xmobb, Inc. |accessdate=2013-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721160910/http://xmobb.com/ |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://oddmobb.com/ |title=Oddmobb |publisher=Oddmobb, Inc. |accessdate=2013-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927032609/http://oddmobb.com/ |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> When Sony announced the PS4 in February 2013, Lanning revisited the launch and failure of Xmobb.

He found that Sony was treating its classic games the way [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[iTunes]] treat classic music, allowing them new life for new and old audiences. Fifteen years after Lanning first created Abe, he was surprised to find that people still email him with the same passion he has for the games.<ref name=\"Stick It To The Man\" /> \"I was happily relieved and surprised that it did stick that much in people's minds,\" said Lanning, \"I didn't start Oddworld as a businessman, I started it as a fan.\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> And by a stroke of luck, the people involved in making the decisions to emulate [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] games on the PS3 are fans of the game and were also involved in Sony during its original launch.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\" /> Now, Lanning has completely changed his view and firmly believes that content created today will have life in the future, as long as the game has quality, and utilizes digital distribution.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" />\n\nDigital distribution is one of the important elements in sustaining the Oddworld/Just Add Water partnership in the video game industry because of the vast savings in cost associated with moving games from developer to consumer digitally instead of physically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgamernation.com/interview-stewart-gilray-ceo-of-just-add-water-ltd/ |title=Interview: Stewart Gilray, CEO of Just Add Water Ltd.|publisher=New Gamer Nation |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> According to Lanning, when ''Abe's Oddysee'' was completed and distributed to the consumer, 20% of royalties went towards his team of developers. They then needed the game to make back approximately four million dollars in earnings using just their 20% in royalties to break even on the funds provided by their publisher, GT Interactive. Once that had been achieved, under the model that assumed the cost of ''Abe's Oddysee'' remained at US$59.99, his team of developers would receive just US$7 for every unit sold.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/26/why-lorne-lanning-went-from-aaa-games-to-indie-and-loudly-loves-it-interview/ |title=Why Lorne Lanning went from triple-A games to indie \u2014 and loudly loves it (interview) |publisher=Gamesbeat |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> The rest would go towards paying all the associated costs that go with publishing, marketing and distributing the game, such as disc manufacturing, licensing fees, fuel for transporting the game to retailers, retail staff and more.<ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> Gilray revealed that in 2013\u20132014, if Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water chose to distribute a game on disc at retail for the [[Xbox 360]], they would have to pay for a minimum of 50,000 discs per territory, at a cost of $600,000, just for manufacturing the discs, before factoring in marketing and development costs, hence the reason for higher costs at the retail shelf.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> And on top of everything else, their physical disc would have to compete with countless other games for selection on the retailer shelf.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\">{{cite web |url=http://epdaily.tv/all/podcast/episode-30/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227041925/http://epdaily.tv/all/podcast/episode-30/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-12-27 |title=Episode 30: It's an Oddworld in the Basement |publisher=ep daily |date=2013-02-01 |accessdate=2013-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nBut their current digital distribution model eliminates the \"radical chasm between who really got the money and who's been doing a lot of the work.\"<ref name=\"Game Theory: Devs vs. Pubs\" /> A game that would sell for US$9.99 on Steam, [[Xbox Live Arcade|XBLA]] or PSN would still net the studio US$7 for every unit sold.<ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> So with digital distribution, all of the costs associated with distributing a physical game are non-existent as the studio \"is not paying for plastic, advertising, shipping or a percentage to retailers... we're just giving it to gamers at a lower price, because we can.\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> Under this model, the player is funding the games more than ever, with 70% of their money going directly to the developer to make more games,<ref name=\"Lanning Kinda Funny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPnUt0VbTJA |title=Oddworld's Lorne Lanning on Games, E3, Government \u2013 Kinda Funny Stage Show E3 2015 |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-06-21 |accessdate=2015-06-22}}</ref> as opposed to the old model where 12% went to the developer and 88% went to the publisher. So the risk being undertaken by the developers with each project is considerably less, because they only need to sell 50,000 units for them to break even and stay in business, as opposed to the one million required in the first week of sales and a 5\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 return overall when using money provided by a major publisher.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> And because they don't have to concern themselves with reaching unit sales targets, they can spend time and money on extras like [[PlayStation Vita|Vita]] and [[Wii U]] ports, despite operating at a financial loss with ''New 'n' Tasty!'' on those platforms, so as to not lock audiences out because of the platform they choose to play,<ref name=\"Lorne GDC Greggy\" /> whereas the model used by the big publishers would be to cancel those ports or ship them as an inferior copy to the other ports because there wouldn't be enough of a monetary return from their audience to justify the extra time spent on making them.<ref name=\"Lorne GDC Greggy\" /> But now, with their Just Add Water partnership, all elements of the business are working together towards the common goal of producing games to fund more games, working for just a 1.5\u00d7 return in order to stay in business, keep people employed, grow the business, and in turn, the games.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\"/> This lower sales requirement affords them the ability to experiment with their games in a way that wasn't possible when the budgets were in excess of ten million dollars, because a failure does not mean the end of the business as it did during the Stranger's Wrath era when they took a risk aiming for perfection using untried concepts without a history of user feedback to guide them.<ref name=\"PSNation Interview Gilray Lanning\" />\n\nLanning says a 1\u00bd\u00d7 return for their upcoming game would allow the company's two groups to focus on two projects\u2014a new version of ''Abe's Exoddus ''using ''New 'n' Tasty!''<nowiki/>'s engine'', ''and a new game.<ref name=\"PSNation Interview Gilray Lanning\" /> And the ports released by Just Add Water under this model are paving the way for more ambitious plans, as \"each project is a bigger risk and a bigger step.\"<ref name=\"The Future's Odd\" /> The first risk was the ''Oddboxx'' on Steam, followed by porting the ''Oddboxx'' to [[PlayStation 3]], ''Stranger HD'' and then ''Munch HD''. Now, their success has paved the way for their biggest project (and risk) to date\u2014rebuilding ''Abe's Oddysee'' to make ''Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!''<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> And though this game has taken longer and cost more than the previous titles, the risk of going out of business or, \"splitting the baby\", is still considerably lower than had the developers gone through a major publisher. ''Stranger's Wrath HD'' for PS3, PC and Vita cost $250,000\u2013300,000, but made a profit of one million dollars, all of which went into the budget for ''New 'n' Tasty!''.<ref name=\"Moonhawk Gilray\" /> As Lanning says, \"Oddworld is about sustainable content in an unsustainable world\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> Their growth might be small, but being that their products are crowd-financed by the audience buying the games, there is no need to appease investors that have brought no value beyond their own cash, or answer to a board that wants to implement policies the studio doesn't agree with, which \"is what drives most of the pressure and most of the distractions\".<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\"/> [[Sensible Software]] co-founder [[Jon Hare]] says that other independent game developers have seen this new option and are not looking back, because they have been [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] from the retail shelves by the bigger companies like EA Games and [[Ubisoft]].<ref name=\"Game Theory: Devs vs. Pubs\">{{cite web|url=http://gametheoryonline.com/2011/02/15/video-games-developers-vs-publishers/ |title= Developers vs. Publishers: Who Wins? |publisher=Game Theory |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>\n\nUnder the agreement between Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water that eliminates the traditional distribution models, \"most of the money that the gamer is spending will come right back to the developer,\"<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 3\" /> meaning the majority of profits made after sales recoup production costs goes directly into making more games, not enriching the owners.<ref name=\"Stick It To The Man\" /><ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> In addition to the profits made from ''Stranger's Wrath HD'', the entire profits from ''Munch's Oddysee HD'' on PS3 and Vita go towards ''New 'n' Tasty!''<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\" /> This allows the studio to sell their games at a cheaper price point than the big studios making Triple-A titles.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 3\" /> Lanning refers to this relationship as that of [[sharecropping]], as opposed to [[serfdom]].<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> And he's finding that in this new landscape where \"creators can find an audience at a lower price, offer a product cheaper, and directly nurture that community,\" that the big publishers are finding it hard to \"justify their value\" in the industry now, especially to the gamers that purchase their products at a higher cost, with most of their money going to the publishers themselves.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 2\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/26/why-lorne-lanning-went-from-aaa-games-to-indie-and-loudly-loves-it-interview/ |title=Why Lorne Lanning went from triple-A games to indie \u2014 and loudly loves it (interview) |publisher=Gamesbeat |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> Gilray said of his time at Lanning's Berkely house in 2010, \"I came away from that with the feeling that, well, that they felt, knew, the game and the brand were in the right hands.\"<ref name=\"Gamefreak Gilray Interview\" /> It is still Lorne Lanning's (and now Stewart Gilray's) ambition to complete the original five-game Quintology that begun with ''Abe's Oddysee'' and continued with ''Munch's Oddysee''.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /><ref name=\"Gamefreak Gilray Interview\" /> And while that ambition was halted by the decision to abandon the publisher/studio relationship, Oddworld Inhabitants, in partnership with Just Add Water, and utilizing digital distribution, are now better equipped to continue the Quintology\u2014this time with Just Add Water as the developer and Oddworld as their micro-publisher.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> As for platforms, they refer to themselves as \"platform-agnostic\"\u2014happy to port their games to any platform.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" />\n\nThe other change to the video game industry that happened at the same time was the release of the [[iPhone]] democratising the industry. Before platforms like the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] allowed anyone to sell their games, the only game developers around were businesses because consoles required a developer to purchase multiple $20,000 [[software development kit]]s in order to build their game on their platform.<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> But when the iPhone came out, the SDK was free to download, and the App Store was free to upload to. This caused an influx of games into the mobile space, because now \"the guys who didn't have the ability to get ten dev stations before can make a business\" and it \"caused a whole migration of talent into a space where they could reach an audience on their own.\"<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> As a result, even the big development companies working on Triple-A titles created their own apps company to open up another access point that they didn't have before. Sony was the first between the two big console developers to follow this trend, which led to Lanning's criticism of Microsoft at E3 in 2013, which was reluctant to allow independent developers onto its console as easily as Sony did with the PlayStation.<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\">{{cite web|url=http://www.godisageek.com/2015/06/lorne-lanning-interview/ |title=It's an Odd, Odd World: An Interview with Lorne Lanning |publisher=God Is A Geek |date=2015-06-20 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref>\n\nLanning's plan to transform Oddworld Inhabitants from a game-developing studio to a self-sustaining micro-publisher independent of \"disconnected investor demands,\" with an ability to communicate with its audience, is where Lanning says the independent developer movement needs to go.<ref name=\"Spare Shelf Space\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-08-02-lanning-hey-buddy-can-you-spare-some-shelf-space |title=Lanning: Hey Buddy, can you spare some shelf space? |publisher=Games Industry |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref> Oddworld and Just Add Water are \"too small to be disruptive, but we can... succeed in the disruptive landscape.\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> And in January 2013, Lanning revealed Oddworld Inhabitants has not sought publishers since its last signing with EA in 2004.<ref name=\"Tell it like it is\" />\n\n====Just Add Water releases====\nJust Add Water's first release in partnership with Oddworld Inhabitants was the porting of 2005's ''Stranger's Wrath'' to the PC's digital network, Steam, in 2010.<ref name=\"Moonhawk Gilray\" /> That was followed by a high-definition remastered edition, ''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD'', released digitally on 21 December 2011 for PlayStation 3.

He hopes that studio heads will see the franchise as \"a successful IP, a decades-old franchise with a loyal fan following that sells millions of units\" that makes it impossible for them to resist investing in a movie or TV series.<ref name=\"Oddworld TV Series\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alphr.com/life-culture/1007233/oddworld-could-get-a-tv-series-if-lorne-lanning-has-his-way |title=KOddworld could get a TV series if Lorne Lanning has his way |publisher=alphr |date=2017-10-03 |accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref> One of the methods for preparing the franchise to cross into new media is to upscale their database of design assets from the upcoming ''Soulstorm'' game beyond that that will be used in the game, to a level required by these media. His preference is to develop a prolonged TV series, because it \"is way more engaging than doing a 90-minute movie that goes out in one and maybe gets a sequel,\" and is more within their budget of $10 million.<ref name=\"Oddworld TV Series\" />\n\n==Purpose==\n\nWhen Lanning was young, he felt lost and overwhelmed by what he saw was wrong with the world, as consumers were fed lies through television and newspapers. He grew up being programmed with information about nuclear submarines, global thermal nuclear war, visions of napalming during the Vietnam war on new colour televisions and the possibility of a new generation of people not dying of old age, at a time when he was just discovering mythologies such as Santa Claus.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> He stored an enormous amount of what he wanted to say concerning what was going on in the world about which the media was not forthcoming.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6BxbX-VHM |title=Eurogamer Expo Develop Session \u2013 Lorne Lanning & Stewart Gilray |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-10-05 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}</ref> And he felt that entertainers like [[Steven Spielberg]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Bob Dylan]] were helping to save the world with entertainment, which was when he discovered that the media most influential on public opinion were mass-produced and electronic.<ref name=\"OI History\" /> He was inspired by the influence of the media on his life: how [[Jim Henson]] and [[Sesame Street]] taught him to read where school had failed; how [[Dr. Seuss]] was able to create stories still being read to new generations that give people a better moral compass and healthier ways to look at the world; how [[George Orwell]] took his personal experiences during World War II to create stories designed to wake people up to the realities of the world around them; how George Lucas's [[Star Wars]] could succeed where religion and philosophy were failing at a time of religious deficit in America, making him \"believe in the possibilities of entertainment for change.\"<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" />\n\nWhen Lanning was working with Sherry McKenna at Rhythm and Hues, his eyes were opened to the possibilities that the CG industry had to offer. While most in the industry were talking CG down, he correctly predicted its potential, watching [[Pixar]] become \"the most successful film studio in world history\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> He saw videos games in the same way, describing them as the \"pop of pop mediums,\" and wanted to get involved because of its potential to become the most successful medium and offer \"nutritious\" content.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> By nutritious, he meant that if video games were a part of the four main food groups, they would be in the \"junk food\" category, because they're not used to get a degree or a job, they're purely for pop entertainment.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> But Lanning believes that video games have the ability to become one of the nutritious food groups by offering useful content with a meaningful message and a psychic, spiritual value to users<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> In categorizing a nutritious game, Lanning explained that they should involve vision, creativity and a richness to lift themselves out of the narrowing of options he was beginning to see.<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> And when games start to \"embody more of the heart that we expect from classical forms of entertainment... more of the soul that we get from a great movie,\" such as stories with emotional depth, powerful character dilemmas and emotional engagement from the audience, the video game industry will expand exponentially.<ref name=\"GDC 2000\" /> Lanning is first and foremost an artist, and \"as an artist, you're constantly trying to figure out how to integrate those things you care about in life in your medium of expression.\"<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> And he found that video games were the perfect medium for combining the philosophies and realities he's observed in the world with the tools and technologies he loves, allowing him to repackage that content into a viable story for an audience with a meaningful message about what is really going on in the world\u2014the [[Clif Bar]] instead of the potato chips.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> So he wanted to instil a morality in video games so that their message could give hope to the next generation of kids and make them feel less lost in the world. But he also wanted to weaponize the pop medium of video games to be used against the \"frauds\" in charge:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|It is people's responsibility in the world today to stand up, and stop being pushovers, and get off your knees, and stop just taking these lies and bullshit that are screwing up our planet, that are screwing up your retirements funds, that are screwing up the value of your home, of your business...

In the early 1990s, Lanning found that video game publishers were not interested in financing entire franchise properties that had plans for multiple sequels \"because sequels only sell 50% of the originals\".<ref name=\"GameOverGreggy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmesVFdEA38&#t=0m36s |title=Lorne Lanning (Special Guest) \u2013 The GameOverGreggy Show Ep. 72 |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-04-24 |accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref> Lanning saw this as the mistake [[20th Century Fox]] made by relinquishing ''Star Wars'' licensing rights to George Lucas. And Lanning realised that the reason sequels were not as successful as the originals was because video games did not come with emotionally compelling characters the way movies did. At this point, video game characters only existed to kill off other characters. So Lanning wanted to create a property that could be recognised as soon as it was seen, like The Muppets, like Star Wars and like Hanna Barber or the Looney Tunes so that new content within the same property, be they sequels or not, could maintain the brand familiarity of the originals, and hopefully its success. Fast forward to today and the video game industry is a sequel-driven industry.<ref name=\"GameOverGreggy\" /> Lanning likened Oddworld to a band making music, and he wanted to be \"the [[Pink Floyd]] of gaming as opposed to a [[Britney Spears]]\"\u2014the insinuation being that \"I don't want to be told [by the publisher] what to make. I want to make the songs I want to make.\"<ref name=\"Eurogamer Developer Session\" /> And those were stories that convey deeper messages about what was really going on in the world, because the artist's vision was more important than the industry's economic requirements, \"I didn't care about making any entertainment if it's not going to be what I care about in life, and so to separate the two is something I'm not interested in.\"<ref name=\"Lanning Interview Gamereactor\" /> He believed the only way to do so was to \"build a globally-recognized brand [and] wind up with the sort of integrity that might stay intact over the years.\"\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|How do we embrace these things... genetically genesplicing in more intelligent messaging, more things that would wake up people, in ways that might affect their life in more positive ways?

This strategy involves packaging meaningful messages deep and personal to his beliefs beneath the veil of an entertaining video game, in the way the Trojans hid deep within the bowels of the wooden horse from [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]].<ref name=\"Trojan Horse Pop\" /> Hence his games touch on elements of \"slavery, globalization, food crisis and animal testing\" in an entertaining but thought-provoking game that doesn't preach to the gamers, yet still contains the messages for those willing to consume them.<ref name=\"Trojan Horse Pop\" /> The challenge now was to do that in a free market society capitalistically driven on growth only, where games with artistic vision are considered too risky to the point of being suicidal industry decisions.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" />\n\nLanning's original plan was for Oddworld Inhabitants to be a \"colossal transmedia endeavour, born of a visionary sense that interactive and non-interactive entertainment would at some point converge, assisted by evolving digital communications.\"<ref name=\"The Future's Odd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/64469/features/the-futures-odd-how-just-add-water-revived-oddworld-and-where-itll-go-next/ |title=The future's Odd: how Just Add Water revived Oddworld, and where it'll go next |publisher=Xbox Magazine |date=2013-10-19 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref> While it was to eventually encompass film and the online world, it would begin with video games because they \"could be a potentially powerful medium for telling great stories\" and because so much American mind share was devoted to video games at the time.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> But his intention was to own his properties and his creations forever, rather than follow the business expectation of licensing characters to the highest bidder. He saw iconic creations like Star Wars, Disney and Pixar, that became \"pied pipers of the most popular characters with noble causes, as a general practice... just becoming the brands on the worst quality health products for new generations... that are being pushed by the largest companies\" and marketed with misinformation about its unhealthiness<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> Instead, Lanning wanted to create characters of high moral integrity and use them to enforce a new licensing model which involved only licensing to companies that use better practices for its employees and for the environment, because \"for creators, some things are more important than money\".<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" />\n\nHe also believes that video games have the power to have a profoundly positive effect on the planet. Right now, the purpose of games to make money and entertain is just the tip of the iceberg. But if video game developers were asked to make games that could:\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|teach kids physics by first grade, teach kids to read by this time, to help engineers better understand how the world works, and biologists and scientists understand by creating virtual worlds that don't necessarily have to turn a profit, but have to show improvement in cognitive skills and statistic benefits to society, if that happened tomorrow, what would gaming be like in ten years from now? And that's not even on the table. It's never up for discussion. It's not going to happen under the current way things work here. But we really are still looking at a medium that's just capable of completely kicking ass over all other mediums.\n|author=[[Lorne Lanning]]\n|source= EP Daily<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" />\n}}\n\nLanning still believes that video games are suffering what has plagued all entertainment industries\u2014an \"unbalanced ratio of Britney Spears-class\" content versus deeper \"Pink Floyd-like\" complexity.\"<ref name=\"Hit List Q&A\" /> But he hopes the 21st century will continue the trend that storytellers like Shakespeare, Pink Floyd and his inspirations Aldous Huxley, George Orwell and HG Wells have used to \"create deeper more meaningful and relevant content that reflects the challenging issues happening in the world around them today\".<ref name=\"More Britney\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/21/4849132/video-game-storytellers-can-learn-from-shakespeare-and-pink-floyd |title=Why video games are more Britney Spears and less Pink Floyd |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-10-21 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> The obstacles preventing them from getting these more meaningful stories out to their audiences, according to Lanning, are \"money, means and the fear of soap box activism\".<ref name=\"More Britney\" /> Sales and marketing departments are more concerned with profit and less with meaningful stories. As a result, the big budget triple-A titles are least likely to risk their profits by releasing content with deeper meaning instead of with tried and true methods of success, because they work in an environment of \"investment versus returns\" dictated by the publishers providing the money they need to make the game. However, if developers can create games that are cheaper and with little or no investment from a publisher, they retain more creative influence on the end product and can then make a game with more meaningful content, instead of what will sell more units.<ref name=\"More Britney\" /> But the danger of making games with these messages is the risk of \"alienating an often jaded userbase through activist ideals\" and making them feel like they are being dictated to by someone on a soap box, instead of entertained way video games have always done.<ref name=\"Trojan Horse Pop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/30/4769188/oddworld-philosophy-of-trojan-horse-pop-lorne-lanning |title=How Oddworld's philosophy of 'trojan horse pop' will hide meaning in games |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> But Lanning believes that the documentary filmmaking industry shows an evolving appetite for reflecting relevant truths that leave audiences with more lasting impressions and value to their lives, hence his method of Trojan Horse pop.<ref name=\"More Britney\" /> And video games can do this the way music and film has, but only if it is led by the independent sector, because they don't have to guarantee high profit margins for investments coming from publishers.\n\n{{\ncentered pull quote|When content is deeper and more meaningful, then you can still create highly digestible and widely consumable entertainment products.

When Lanning first entered the industry with ''Abe's Oddysee'' in the mid 90s, developers could only rely on focus groups and market research for feedback; they would only see review scores after release; and stores would not give them information on who was buying their games.<ref name=\"Customer Feedback\">{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/29/oddworld-creator-on-how-customer-feedback-changed-gaming/?sr_source=Twitter |title='Oddworld' creator on how customer feedback changed gaming |publisher=Engadget |date=2016-06-29 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}</ref> But by then, it was too late to allow the audience to contribute to its development.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" /> Today, however, social networking has allowed them to be in constant contact with their audience through the planning and development stages to allow them to make decisions on development, and on which games to create.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" /> When they released a trailer for ''New 'n' Tasty!'' during its development, by the same night, they had received 10,000 responses through Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, by the next day, 20,000 responses, numbers no marketing department could ever generate at the time of ''Abe's Oddysee'' in 1997 with market research or focus groups.<ref name=\"Customer Feedback\" /> \"Content co-creation\" is all about facilitating a conversation between creator and player, which Lanning believes was not possible in the time of distributing at retail outlets,<ref name=\"PlayStation Blogcast\" /> and according to him, is the future of game development because it extends the game beyond the written story.<ref name=\"Clay Sculptures\" /> And it allows players to feel a sense of ownership that they have helped model the very game they have played. \"It's one thing to say, 'Look at this picture of this beautiful baby.' It's another thing to say, 'Look at this picture of ''my'' beautiful baby.' There's a whole different depth of connection and ownership,\" Lanning said. They also discovered that it didn't matter to audiences about the brand going big, but that they targeted more platforms and networks for audiences to play on.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" />\n\nSo the studio polled their audience to find out what kind of game they wanted to play, and found that fans wanted ''Abe's Oddysee'' redone like ''Stranger's Wrath''.<ref name=\"Triple-A to Indie 3\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/26/why-lorne-lanning-went-from-aaa-games-to-indie-and-loudly-loves-it-interview/3/ |title=Why Lorne Lanning went from triple-A games to indie \u2014 and loudly loves it (interview) |publisher=Gamesbeat |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}</ref> While the relationship between Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water was symbiotic, with JAW constantly running things by Oddworld Inhabitants via email conversations,<ref name=\"In Odd We Trust\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesabyss.com/in-odd-we-trust-an-interview-with-oddworld-inhabitants/ |title=In Odd We Trust: An Interview with Oddworld Inhabitants |publisher=Games Abyss |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref> Lanning told JAW to ask the audience for input in answering their questions about the game, because they are the ones that will be playing it. The more you engage them in the process, \"that feedback is going to be really, really valuable\" and when they see that you are genuinely listening, they feel like they are being heard and it creates \"deeper more passionate fan bases\".<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> Audiences also had an influence on choosing the next project after ''New 'n' Tasty!'' saying they wanted Exoddus redone in the same way, resulting in what will become ''Oddworld: Soulstorm'' in 2017, and the response from the press release showed them that interest in the brand was still very much alive.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" />\n\nAlong with getting the games into the consumers' hands, publishing companies advertise a developer's game to the consumers. And for the first time in Oddworld's time as an independent developer, they have had to address the issue of advertising without the five million dollar marketing campaign that publishers provided them in the past,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vET9uBmQqdU |title= Abe's Oddysee HD New 'n' Tasty!

|publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=2013-07-17 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nWhen YouTube introduced a new Content ID system in December 2013 allowing holders of copyright material to flag content they had not approved to be published on the service, such as Let's Plays, commercial trailers, and screen shots, Oddworld Inhabitants issued a statement on their own website informing fans that they give \"explicit permission to anyone on the service to broadcast using Oddworld games\" without fear of being issued a copyright claim, because \"nothing makes us happier than to see you guys enjoying our games, and it's something we encourage wholeheartedly.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/2013/12/oddworlds-position-on-youtubes-new-content-id-system/ |title=Oddworld's Position On YouTube's New Content ID System |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref> YouTube and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] are platforms that Oddworld Inhabitants take seriously because today, they're more important for game exposure than television, and it's where fans are the most objective, which Lanning believes is important for developers when seeking feedback.<ref name=\"Development Really Like\" /> And on Twitch, customer feedback can be watched in real time.<ref name=\"Customer Feedback\" />\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Oddworld Inhabitants launched a competition inviting fans to submit names for five [[Trophies (PS3)|trophies]] to be included on the PlayStation port of the game, with winners announced 14 February to receive a signed game poster, code for the PlayStation platform of their choice, and inclusion in the game's credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/2014/01/contest-name-a-trophy-in-new-n-tasty-win-prizes/ |title=CONTEST: Name Trophies in New 'n' Tasty, Win Ridiculous Prizes |publisher=Oddworld Inhabitants |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> None of these things would have happened outside of the digital world. When Lanning is asked how he would encourage new fans to his game, he directs them to the oldest fans of his franchise, because \"they have a certain passion, they've stayed with us... they speak to it better than we do [and] we're not paying them\".<ref name=\"E3 2013 Live Oddworld\" />\n\nBy involving fans so early on in the production of the game, beginning with letting them choose what game the developers would make, and then its title and the design of its cover art, the relationship has encouraged people to offer content for free because they want to see the developers survive, whereas in the past, developers would have to pay for people to contribute voices.<ref name=\"Properties Apocalypse\" /> And by producing a product with enough quality that it creates the kind of brand awareness that mobilises an audience into supporting developers, that product can be financially incentivising enough for big companies like Sony, Apple or Microsoft to support and invest in\u2014the best example being that of Minecraft.<ref name=\"Lanning Kinda Funny\" /> And if developers can get the kind of exposure that comes with that support, but remain independent, then the blockbuster titles of the next generation will come out of the indie space.<ref name=\"Lanning Kinda Funny\" />\n\nThe other important factor that has ensured their revival is the integrity that the Oddworld brand sustained when they first made their video games.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Pre-Interview\" /> The Oddworld games were built on millions in funding compared to the current games on portable platforms that are made with so much less.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" /> The 2D nature of the ''Abe'' games has also helped, according to Lanning, as mobile platforms lend itself well to 2D games, hence there is no judgment towards ''Oddysee'' and ''Exoddus'' for being 2D.<ref name=\"Vic's Basement\" />\n\nThe games have found success a second time on the digital landscape, due in small part to the [[guerrilla marketing]] possible with today's media, but more importantly because of the brand recognition that came from nurturing their original audience in the late 90s, which Lanning believes has them fortunately ahead of the indie developers pack.<ref name=\"PSNation Interview Gilray Lanning\" /> Said Lanning, \"As long as we don't try to exploit the dollars out of that fanbase in cheap ways... then we should be able to keep growing that fanbase and reigniting it,\" with the goal to be raising enough money to make triple-A titles that are self-funded.\n\nLanning found that the fans that grew up on ''Abe's Oddysee'' and ''Abe's Exoddus'' in the late 90s are now parents that have children,<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> and when those games became available digitally through Steam and PSN, they saw that their first fans were now turning the games onto their children. In the last quarter of 2012, the 13-year-old Abe games sold 300,000 units (10% of what it sold in its entire run on PC and PS1) via digital distribution through word of mouth alone before any form of marketing.<ref name=\"Nathan Interviews Lorne\" />\n\n''Stranger's Wrath HD'' sold almost 250,000 units between December 2011 and October 2012 on the PlayStation 3, not including future sales on Steam, whereas the original Xbox version sold 600,000 units in its lifetime.<ref name=\"Not Ferraris\" /> By March 2014, the entire Oddworld portfolio sold two million units on the digital landscape.<ref name=\"Venture Beat Bet\" /> However, Gilray was acutely aware of how the huge gap in game production can affect Oddworld's ability to keep up with technology unavailable when they were making games. So when remastering ''Stranger'' and ''Munch'', they included features like [[PlayStation Move]], 3D support and online leaderboards.<ref name=\"In Odd We Trust\" />\n\nThe other new lesson to come from the current gaming landscape has been using analytics to understand the behavioral patterns of gamers. Lanning describes analytics as the new religion of the online space and believes the company that has the best learning engine for analytics is [[Zynga]].<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" /> While he may not like their games, \"when you look at the science of how they are analysing what their audience is doing, there's a reason why they have 170 million users today\u2014larger than the install-base of the entire console market\".<ref name=\"From The Desk Of Lorne Lanning\" />\n\n==Released titles==\nThe developers originally stated that the ''Oddworld'' series would consist of five inter-connected games referred to as the Quintology. Only two of those five games have been produced, while two additional games from the same universe were developed as expansion titles outside of the Quintology. Production on the Quintology's final three games was halted when the company decided to redirect its efforts toward film production. Those plans, too, were shelved. In 2009, a partnership was created with developers [[Just Add Water (company)|Just Add Water]] to continue developing the abandoned video games with Oddworld Inhabitants Inc. becoming the publisher of the titles. In order to raise the money to fund the rest of the Quintology, Just Add Water began by porting the studio's first two titles to new consoles and producing high definition remasters of ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'' and ''Stranger's Wrath''. A high definition rebuild of ''Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee'' subtitled ''New 'n' Tasty!'' was next. Stewart Gilray has confirmed that all five Quintology games are titled Oddworld: X's Oddysee where X is the name of the protagonist.<ref name=\"Joypad Podcast\">{{cite podcast|url=http://joypadandme.com/2014/01/26/podcast-episode-45-an-odd-world-with-special-guest-stewart-gilray/ |title=PODCAST EPISODE 45: AN ODD WORLD WITH SPECIAL GUEST STEWART GILRAY |website=joypadandme.com |publisher=Joypad And Me|host=Jedi Junkie |date=2014-01-26 |accessdate=2014-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Published by [[GT Interactive]] for [[PlayStation]], [[DOS]] and [[Windows]] platforms, it is the first in their planned five-game Quintology of games set on the fictional planet of Oddworld. The game tells the story of Abe, a happy, ignorant factory worker and the destined savior of his mudokon race.<ref name=Schott>Carr, Diane, David Buckingham, Andrew Burn, Gareth Schott, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSp7uW75TrYC Computer Games: Text, Narrative and Play], Polity</ref> Abe is a lowly floor waxer at RuptureFarms, a meat processing plant run by the evil glukkons on Oddworld's largest continent of Mudos. The plant makes sweet and savory treats by farming and slaughtering the wildlife that roam the rural areas surrounding the plant, and exploits 100 mudokons for slave labor to run their factory. When Abe discovers the glukkons' plan to increase their dwindling profits by using the mudokons in their new tasty treat, he vows to escape the plant and save his 99 friends. Along the way, he meets a spiritual guide that opens his mind to the mudokons' bond with nature and Abe's personal destiny to awaken the powerful mudokon gods and become the prophesied savior who would return his race to their sacred holy lands. The game is a side-scrolling 2D [[platformer]] with lifelike animation on top of photo-realistic backgrounds. Its revolutionary features included the ability to \"chant\" in order to possess and remotely control the bodies of Slig guards to solve puzzles or allow Abe to advance safely; and a feature called gamespeak, the ability for the player to engage in conversation with other mudokons to navigate them to safety. The game was later ported to Gameboy by Saffire under the title ''Oddworld Adventures''.\n\n===''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus''===\n{{Main|Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus}}\n\nFollowing the success of ''Abe's Oddysee'', Oddworld temporarily shelved plans for the next game in their Quintology to produce an instant follow up that could capitalize on the popularity of the first game. The resultant spinoff game, ''Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'' was released the following year in 1998, again published by GT Interactive for PlayStation and Windows platforms. A direct sequel to ''Oddysee'', ''Exoddus'' begins immediately after Abe returns from RuptureFarms with his fellow mudokons, receiving a vision from the spirits of his ancestors. They plead for his help in stopping the glukkons from digging up mudokon bones to make the addictive Soulstorm Brew.<ref name=bio>[http://www.oddworld.com/firsttenyears/universe/native/characters/mudokons/ow_abe_bio.html Abe biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720104338/http://oddworld.com/firsttenyears/universe/native/characters/mudokons/ow_abe_bio.html |date=20 July 2006 }}, Official Oddworld Website.</ref> Along the way, Abe rescues more of his mudokon race and learns more about their sacred history, living in harmony with nature and the wildlife.<ref name=\"Robinson, John\">[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9902/04/oddworld/index.html Something strange is brewing in 'Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus'], CNN.</ref> Coming so quickly after the previous game, ''Exoddus'' used ''Oddysee'''s game engine, remaining a 2D side-scrolling platformer, albeit adding more, longer levels and extra features. Abe's abilities were expanded upon to include more communication options and wider chant abilities allowing the possession of other species.<ref name=Thomas>Thomas, Maureen, Fran\u00e7ois Penz, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UozK9smjVcC Architectures of Illusion: From Motion Pictures to Navigable Interactive Environments], Intellect Books</ref> Mudokons were also further developed, now having moods that affect Abe's ability to communicate with them and enlist their co-operation.\n\n===''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee''===\n{{Main|Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee}}\n\nOddworld Inhabitants' third game, ''Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee'' was the second of their planned five-game Quintology series. Released in 2001 as a direct sequel to their two previous entries, the game was published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] exclusively for the Xbox. Abe returns, but the game introduces a new protagonist in Munch, the last living remnant of the near-extinct, amphibious gabbit creatures. The story again involves Abe embarking on a quest to free the weak from the tyranny of the powerful capitalist creatures that exploit them for their own gain. Players assume the dual roles of Abe and Munch as they team up to escape the vicious Vykkers who harvested the gabbits in order to profit from their eggs\u2014a delicacy on Oddworld\u2014and ultimately destroy the Vykker's Labs. The game marks the series' introduction into 3D environments, though retaining its roots as a platformer. It is also the first game to introduce a second protagonist, allowing the player to switch between Abe and Munch to take advantage of abilities exclusive to each character. Also pivotal was the expansion of elements that were only touched on in their two previous games, such as the ability to \"create characters and use them as allies to attack, defend and solve work problems in the world.\"<ref name=\"Xbox Interview Lanning\" /> Other changes include new chanting features, the ability for Abe to pick up objects or people, and power ups that affect gameplay.\n\n===''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath''===\n{{Main|Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath}}\n\nVeering away from the Quintology a second time, Oddworld Inhabitants' fourth game was ''Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath'', published for the Xbox in 2005 by [[Electronic Arts]]. The first Oddworld game to be entirely independent of the Abe series, ''Stranger's Wrath'' is set in the Wild West of Oddworld and follows a bounty hunter known only as the Stranger, one of the last remaining \"steef\" on Oddworld, as he collects bounties for capturing outlaws in order to save enough \"moolah\" for a life-saving operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/60957/features/oddworld-strangers-wrath-why-oddworlds-only-fps-deserves-a-second-chance/ |title=Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath \u2013 why Oddworld's only FPS deserves a second chance |publisher=Xbox Magazine |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref> The game continues the 3D gameplay introduced by ''Munch's Oddysee'' and switches between first person perspective for shooting, and third person perspective for long range running, platform jumping and melee combat.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/technology/circuits/17game.html?_r=1&ex=1109307600&en=c4214af930777332&ei=5070&oref=slogin Underneath It All, Substance Sells,] ''New York Times''.</ref> It also moves away from Oddworld's reliance on puzzles in favor of an action-adventure style with elements of role playing. Its prominent new features included \"live ammunition\", where the player can use various in-game creatures and projectiles for differing effects; and the ability to use the game's money system to purchase various items and weapon upgrades.\n\n===''Oddboxx''===\nIn 2009, Lorne Lanning announced plans to make an Oddworld [[Online distribution|digital download]] package exclusively for PC to contain ''Abe's Oddysee'', ''Abe's Exoddus'', and for the first time on the platform, ''Munch's Oddysee'' and ''Stranger's Wrath''. When Oddworld Inhabitants unveiled their re-designed website on 4 November 2010, they declared the then in-development package would be titled ''Oddboxx''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/?p=249 |title=The Oddboxx &#124; Oddworld Inhabitants |publisher=Oddworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref> The European and U.S. prices of the ''Oddboxx'' were revealed on 14 December<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oddworld.com/?p=271 |title=Oddboxx \u2013 Euro and U.S. Prices.

The game remained a side-scrolling platformer, but has done away with the original's flip screen presentation in favour of smooth continuous scrolling and a dynamic camera for zooming in and out based on the movements of the player and the scenery. The story is completely identical to ''Oddysee'' and new FMV sequences have been added to recreations of the originals to further illustrate the plot. The soundtrack too has been recreated from scratch, with additional pieces added. ''New 'n' Tasty!'' debuted on PS4 in July 2014, as part of an exclusive release with Sony in exchange for giving Oddworld Inhabitants their own booth at E3 in 2013, and centre stage at Sony's 2013 E3 presentation.<ref name=\"Venture Beat Bet\" /> Versions for Linux, Microsoft Windows and OS X were released on February 25, 2015 while the Xbox One version was released on March 27, 2015.

The story is set in a rural land resembling [[Afghanistan]]<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> far from the continent of Mudos where the first four Oddworld games were based, inspired by the \"United States propaganda approach\" of pretending to free the region, but really wanting to \"rob it and slaughter it and leave it as rubble\".<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> The invaders are a foreign species resembling an Eastern European<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> or \"Russian mafia\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> whose genetics include traces of feline DNA. Fangus' history reveals canine DNA, allowing for Lanning's desire to \"play off of that dog versus cat theme\" that he's always wanted to visit\u2014\"one of those dynamic, eternal battles... myths that lie deep in our history of civilization... like good versus evil.\"<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> The invaders have turned this \"beautiful landscape into meth labs,\"<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" /> \"whilst the dogs find themselves fighting for scraps in a war-torn region.\"<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> Fangus is a shepherd who is directly affected by the invasion, \"finding out he's only got so long, and the circumstances that have [led] him to this position means he's going to have to fight,<ref name =\"New Era Oddworld\" /> following a similar journey to that of the [[Maximus Decimus Meridius|Roman general]] in [[Gladiator (2000 film)|''Gladiator'']].<ref name=\"Odd Odd World\" />\n\nOddworld Inhabitants delayed reacting to a rumor about the game which caused many to consider the development the playing of an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools' Day prank]]. In a June 2009 issue of Game Informer, Lorne Lanning officially spoke about the game, revealing concept art and story details, and plans to distribute the game digitally. A Mature rating by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] was expected due to dark tones and themes throughout the game. [[Majesco Entertainment]] was expected to publish the game for the Xbox before it was canceled when they failed to come to agreements with Sherry McKenna and Lorne Lanning. In a 9 May 2011 FAQ, an Oddworld Inhabitants representative confirmed ''Fangus Klot'' will be in future plans following ''The Hand Of Odd'' and ''Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!''<ref name=\"Oddworld Inhabitants\"/> and Lanning further expressed his desire to make the game, though financing it is the obstacle.<ref name=\"Tell it like it is\" /><ref>Lanning, L.

Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into [[political economy]] and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics.

The paper is often recognizable by its [[fire engine red|fire-engine-red]] nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with [[Byline|no byline]], in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. The paper is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, ''[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]'', and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\n\nThe [[The Economist editorial stance|editorial stance of ''The Economist'']] primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]].

Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of [[corporate social responsibility]], published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from [[Oxfam]], the [[World Food Programme]], [[United Nations Global Compact]], the Chairman of [[BT Group]], an ex-Director of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and the UK [[Institute of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/542754 |title= Compilation: Full text of responses to Economist survey on Corporate Social Responsibility (January\u2013February 2005)|accessdate=3 February 2007|work=Business & Human Rights}}</ref>\n\nMany of the letters published are critical of its stance or commentary. After ''The Economist'' ran a critique of [[Amnesty International]] and human rights in general in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954694|title=Letters: On Amnesty International and human rights, Iraq, tax breaks 4&nbsp;April 2007|accessdate=9 November 2007|work=The Economist|date=4 April 2007}}</ref> Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local [[right-of-reply]] laws without compromising editorial independence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnZjYJ3TduUC&pg=PA173 |title=The Media Enthralled: Singapore Revisited|author=Francis T.

Benfica|Sport Lisboa e Benfica]] is a Portuguese professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Lisbon]], whose involvement in European competition dates back to the 1950s. As [[1954\u201355 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|champions of Portugal]], Benfica were supposed to participate in the [[1955\u201356 European Cup|inaugural edition]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955, but they were not invited by the organizers. Two years later, they made their European debut against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the European Cup, on 19 September 1957.\n\nBenfica won their first European title in [[1961 European Cup Final|1961]], defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to win the European Cup, and successfully retained the title in [[1962 European Cup Final|the following year]] after defeating [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. After that, they appeared in five more finals \u2013 [[1962\u201363 European Cup|1963]], [[1965 European Cup Final|'65]], [[1968 European Cup Final|'68]], [[1988 European Cup Final|'88]] and [[1990 European Cup Final|'90]] \u2013 but failed to reconquer the title. These consecutive final losses have been attributed to a famous [[Sports-related curses|curse]] by Hungarian manager [[B\u00e9la Guttmann]] in 1962. Benfica have also played in three [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League]] finals \u2013 [[1983 UEFA Cup Final|1983]], [[2013 UEFA Europa League Final|2013]] and [[2014 UEFA Europa League Final|'14]] \u2013 losing all three.\n\nWith 2 titles, Benfica are the second most decorated Portuguese team in [[UEFA competitions]], and hold the Portuguese record for most appearances in [[UEFA Competitions' finals|UEFA competitions' finals]], with 10 appearances. Additionally, the 39 participations in the Champions League (formerly the European Cup) are only surpassed by Real Madrid and they occupy, as of 11 March 2020, the eighh place at the [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League records and statistics#All-time top 25 European Champion Clubs' Cup and Champions League rankings|competition's all-time ranking]]. \n\nBenfica's biggest European win is 10\u20130, which came against [[Stade Dudelange]] of Luxembourg for the [[1965\u201366 European Cup]], and their 18\u20130 aggregate win constitutes a European Cup record. Brazilian defender [[Luis\u00e3o]] holds the club record for appearances in Europe, with 124 matches, while former Portuguese striker [[Eus\u00e9bio]] is the club's leading European goalscorer, with 56 goals. \n\n==Background==\n{{Further|UEFA competitions}}\nThe first continental competition organised by [[UEFA]] was the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955. Conceived by [[Gabriel Hanot]], the editor of ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'', as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues, it is considered the most prestigious European football competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/index.html|title=Football's premier club competition|website=[[UEFA]]|access-date=25 December 2011}}</ref> That year, Benfica had won the [[1954\u201355 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], but the competition organizers selected [[Sporting CP]] to take part in the first edition.<ref name=\"1st edition\">{{cite web|title=50 years of European Cup|url=https://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/240459.pdf#page=6|website=[[UEFA]]|date=October 2004|pages=6\u20137|access-date=8 May 2016}}</ref> Another club competition, the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], was established in 1955 and contested in parallel with the European Cup.

In the following years, UEFA created additional club competitions. The first, the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], was inaugurated in 1960 for the winners of domestic cup competitions. Established in 1973, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] was originally a match played between the winners of the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup. Since 2000, it has been contested by the winners of the Champions League (formerly the European Cup) and the Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/history/index.html|title=Club competition winners do battle|website=[[UEFA]]|access-date=2 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] was a competition for the winners of the European Cup (the later UEFA Champions League) and its South American equivalent, the [[Copa Libertadores]]. Established in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup was jointly organised by UEFA and the [[CONMEBOL|Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol]] (CONMEBOL).

Benfica|Sport Lisboa e Benfica]] is a Portuguese professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Lisbon]], whose involvement in European competition dates back to the 1950s. As [[1954\u201355 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|champions of Portugal]], Benfica were supposed to participate in the [[1955\u201356 European Cup|inaugural edition]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955, but they were not invited by the organizers. Two years later, they made their European debut against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the European Cup, on 19 September 1957.\n\nBenfica won their first European title in [[1961 European Cup Final|1961]], defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to win the European Cup, and successfully retained the title in [[1962 European Cup Final|the following year]] after defeating [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. After that, they appeared in five more finals \u2013 [[1962\u201363 European Cup|1963]], [[1965 European Cup Final|'65]], [[1968 European Cup Final|'68]], [[1988 European Cup Final|'88]] and [[1990 European Cup Final|'90]] \u2013 but failed to reconquer the title. These consecutive final losses have been attributed to a famous [[Sports-related curses|curse]] by Hungarian manager [[B\u00e9la Guttmann]] in 1962.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches.

There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He also played for Tauranga against Te Puke and despite recently joing the rugby code was named captain\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kusabs' Cup Match Next Saturday\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7710\n| date = 1921-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210602.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against Hamilton<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

It is also within the [[Greater Houston|Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land]] metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\nGalveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the 18th century: [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez y Madrid, Count of G\u00e1lvez]] (1746\u20131786), who was born in [[Macharaviaya]], [[M\u00e1laga]], in the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Galveston's first [[Europe]]an settlements on the [[Galveston Island]] were built around 1816 by [[Kingdom of France|French]] pirate [[Louis-Michel Aury]] to help the fledgling [[Republic of Mexico]] fight for independence from [[Spain]], along with other colonies in the  [[Western Hemisphere]] of the [[Americas]] in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] in the 1810s and 1820s. The [[Port of Galveston]] was established in 1825 by the [[Congress of Mexico]] following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledgling [[Texas Navy]] during the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the  [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDuring the 19th century, Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest [[port]]s in the [[United States]]. It was for a time, Texas' largest city, known as the \"Queen City of the Gulf\". It was devastated by the unexpected [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], whose effects included massive flooding and a storm surge which nearly wiped out the town. The natural disaster on the exposed [[barrier island]] is still ranked today as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated death toll of 6,000 to 12,000 people. The city subsequently reemerged during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] of 1919\u20131933 as a leading tourist hub and a [[Free State of Galveston|center of illegal gambling]], nicknamed the [[Free State of Galveston]] until this era ended in the 1950s with subsequent other economic and social development.\n\nMuch of Galveston's economy is centered in the [[tourism]], [[health care]], [[shipping]], and [[finance|financial]] industries. The {{convert|84|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] campus with an enrollment of more than 2,500 students is a major economic force of the city. Galveston is home to six [[historic districts]] containing one of the largest and historically significant collections of 19th-century buildings in the U.S., with over 60 structures listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], maintained by the [[National Park Service]] in the [[United States Department of the Interior]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Galveston, Texas}}\n\n===Exploration and 19th-century development===\n[[File:Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas (circa 1845)]][[File:Map of City of Galveston.jpg|thumb|Map of City of Galveston (circa 1904)]]\nIndigenous inhabitants of Galveston Island called the island <i>Auia</i>.<ref name=McComb1>{{cite book|last=McComb|first=David G.|title=Galveston: A History|location=Austin|publisher=University of Texas Press|chapter=\u201dThe Edge of Time\u201d|year=1986|ISBN=978-0292-720534}}</ref> Though there is no certainty regarding their route and their landings, Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were shipwrecked at a place he called \u201cIsla de Malhado\u201d in November 1528.

He was working under the orders of Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez. In his early chart, he calls the western end of the island \u201cIsla de San Luis\u201d and the eastern end, \u201cPt. de Culebras.\u201d Evia did not label the island itself on his map of 1799. Just five years later Alexander von Humboldt borrows the place names Isla de San Luis, Pte. De Culebras, and Bahia de Galveston. Stephen F. Austin followed his predecessors in the use of \u201cSan Luis Island,\u201d but introduced \u201cGalveston\u201d to refer to the little village at the east end of the island.

It is also within the [[Greater Houston|Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land]] metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\nGalveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the 18th century: [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez y Madrid, Count of G\u00e1lvez]] (1746\u20131786), who was born in [[Macharaviaya]], [[M\u00e1laga]], in the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Galveston's first [[Europe]]an settlements on the [[Galveston Island]] were built around 1816 by [[Kingdom of France|French]] pirate [[Louis-Michel Aury]] to help the fledgling [[Republic of Mexico]] fight for independence from [[Spain]], along with other colonies in the  [[Western Hemisphere]] of the [[Americas]] in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] in the 1810s and 1820s. The [[Port of Galveston]] was established in 1825 by the [[Congress of Mexico]] following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledgling [[Texas Navy]] during the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the  [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDuring the 19th century, Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest [[port]]s in the [[United States]]. It was for a time, Texas' largest city, known as the \"Queen City of the Gulf\". It was devastated by the unexpected [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], whose effects included massive flooding and a storm surge which nearly wiped out the town. The natural disaster on the exposed [[barrier island]] is still ranked today as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated death toll of 6,000 to 12,000 people. The city subsequently reemerged during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] of 1919\u20131933 as a leading tourist hub and a [[Free State of Galveston|center of illegal gambling]], nicknamed the [[Free State of Galveston]] until this era ended in the 1950s with subsequent other economic and social development.\n\nMuch of Galveston's economy is centered in the [[tourism]], [[health care]], [[shipping]], and [[finance|financial]] industries. The {{convert|84|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] campus with an enrollment of more than 2,500 students is a major economic force of the city. Galveston is home to six [[historic districts]] containing one of the largest and historically significant collections of 19th-century buildings in the U.S., with over 60 structures listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], maintained by the [[National Park Service]] in the [[United States Department of the Interior]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Galveston, Texas}}\n\n===Exploration and 19th-century development===\n[[File:Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas (circa 1845)]][[File:Map of City of Galveston.jpg|thumb|Map of City of Galveston (circa 1904)]]\nIndigenous inhabitants of Galveston Island called the island <i>Auia</i>.<ref name=McComb1>{{cite book|last=McComb|first=David G.|title=Galveston: A History|location=Austin|publisher=University of Texas Press|chapter=\u201dThe Edge of Time\u201d|year=1986|ISBN=978-0292-720534}}</ref> Though there is no certainty regarding their route and their landings, Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were shipwrecked at a place he called \u201cIsla de Malhado\u201d in November 1528.

He was working under the orders of Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez. In his early chart, he calls the western end of the island \u201cIsla de San Luis\u201d and the eastern end, \u201cPt. de Culebras.\u201d Evia did not label the island itself on his map of 1799. Just five years later Alexander von Humboldt borrows the place names Isla de San Luis, Pte. De Culebras, and Bahia de Galveston. Stephen F. Austin followed his predecessors in the use of \u201cSan Luis Island,\u201d but introduced \u201cGalveston\u201d to refer to the little village at the east end of the island.
