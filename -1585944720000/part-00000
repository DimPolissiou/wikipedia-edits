[[Audio engineer|Engineered]] by [[Steve Albini]], it features band leader [[Kim Deal]] on vocals and guitar, [[Josephine Wiggs]] on bass, [[Britt Walford]] on drums, and [[Tanya Donelly]] on guitar. Albini's production prioritized sound over technical accomplishment; the final [[Take#Music recording|takes]] favor the band's spontaneous live \"in studio\" performances.\n\nThe Breeders formed in 1988 when Deal, bass player for [[Pixies (band)|the Pixies]], befriended Donelly of [[Throwing Muses]] during a European tour. They recorded a [[country music|country]]-infused [[Demo (music)|demo]] in 1989, leading to 4AD co-founder [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] funding an album, ''Pod'', recorded that year at the Palladium studio in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nDue in part to Deal's work with the Pixies, the album was widely anticipated, particularly in Europe. It became a critical and popular success, reaching number 22 in the UK. Critics praised its dark, sexualized lyrics, and compared it favorably to the Pixies. [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] said it was one of his favorite records, and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' ranked it number 81 on its list of the best albums of the 1990s. The cover art was designed by [[Vaughan Oliver]] and portrays a man performing a fertility dance while wearing a belt of eels.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kim-Breeders-Zappa-Tel-Aviv-2008-08-22-06.jpg|thumb|alt=Kim Deal performing live in 2008|Kim Deal performing live in 2008]]\n\nIn 1988, [[Kim Deal]] of [[Pixies (band)|the Pixies]] became friends with [[Tanya Donelly]] of [[Throwing Muses]] when their respective bands undertook a joint tour of Europe.<ref name=Aston318>{{harvnb|Aston|2013|p=318}}</ref> Deal and Donelly spent time together playing guitar, drinking beer<ref name=Donelly72>Donelly, Tanya in {{harvnb|Spitz|2004|p=72}}</ref> and sharing musical ideas.<ref name=Deal132>Deal, Kim in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=132}}</ref> They often went clubbing together in the bands' hometown of Boston.<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{harvnb|Erlewine}}</ref><ref name=Donelly132>Donelly, Tanya in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=132}}</ref> While attending a [[The Sugarcubes|Sugarcubes]] concert, the two drunkenly decided to write and record dance songs.<ref name=Aston318/><ref name=Murphy131>Murphy, John in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=131}}</ref> Their first attempt to work together was based around the idea of an \"organic dance band\" consisting of Deal on bass, Donelly on guitar, and two drummers.<ref name=Donelly72/> They recorded Donelly's \"Rise\" with Throwing Muses' [[David Narcizo]],<ref name=Aston318/> and planned more originals, as well as a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Rufus (band)|Rufus and Chaka Khan]]'s \"[[Tell Me Something Good]]\".<ref name=Donelly72/>\n\n[[File:Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses, 1991.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tanya Donelly singing in a microphone|Tanya Donelly (shown in 1991) and Kim Deal started the Breeders after becoming friends in 1988.<ref name=Aston318/>]]\n\nA year and a half passed without the pair recording new material.<ref name=Aston318/> During this time, they decided their attempt at dance music was not working,<ref name=\"Donelly132\" /><ref name=\"Murphy131\" /> and resolved to repurpose their songs for a different genre.<ref name=Deal132/> Deal became more serious about her work with Donnelly when the Pixies' [[Black Francis]] announced he was undertaking a solo tour.

\"Opened\".<ref name=DealinMico/> The track features a buoyant rhythm<ref name=Aston320/> and was described by Stenger as exhilaratingly bringing the listener somewhere between reality and the

records in May 1990. [[Audio engineer|Engineered]] by [[Steve Albini]], it features band leader [[Kim Deal]] on vocals and guitar, [[Josephine Wiggs]] on bass, [[Britt Walford]] on drums, and [[Tanya Donelly]] on guitar. Albini's production prioritized sound over technical accomplishment; the final [[Take#Music recording|takes]] favor the band's spontaneous live \"in studio\" performances.\n\nThe Breeders formed in 1988 when Deal, bass player for [[Pixies (band)|the Pixies]], befriended Donelly of [[Throwing Muses]] during a European tour. They recorded a [[country music|country]]-infused [[Demo (music)|demo]] in 1989, leading to 4AD co-founder [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] funding of an album, ''Pod'', recorded that year at the Palladium studio in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nDue in part to Deal's work with the Pixies, the album was widely anticipated, particularly in Europe. It became a critical and popular success, reaching number 22 in the UK. Critics praised its dark, sexualized lyrics, and compared it favorably to the Pixies. [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] said it was one of his favorite records, and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' ranked it number 81 on its list of the best albums of the 1990s. The cover art was designed by [[Vaughan Oliver]] and portrays a man performing a fertility dance while wearing a belt of eels.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kim-Breeders-Zappa-Tel-Aviv-2008-08-22-06.jpg|thumb|alt=Kim Deal performing live in 2008|Kim Deal performing live in 2008]]\n\nIn 1988, [[Kim Deal]] of [[Pixies (band)|the Pixies]] became friends with [[Tanya Donelly]] of [[Throwing Muses]] when their respective bands undertook a joint tour of Europe.<ref name=Aston318>{{harvnb|Aston|2013|p=318}}</ref> Deal and Donelly spent time together playing guitar, drinking beer<ref name=Donelly72>Donelly, Tanya in {{harvnb|Spitz|2004|p=72}}</ref> and sharing musical ideas.<ref name=Deal132>Deal, Kim in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=132}}</ref> They often went clubbing together in the bands' hometown of Boston.<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{harvnb|Erlewine}}</ref><ref name=Donelly132>Donelly, Tanya in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=132}}</ref> While attending a [[The Sugarcubes|Sugarcubes]] concert, the two drunkenly decided to write and record dance songs.<ref name=Aston318/><ref name=Murphy131>Murphy, John in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=131}}</ref> Their first attempt to work together was based around the idea of an \"organic dance band\" consisting of Deal on bass, Donelly on guitar, and two drummers.<ref name=Donelly72/> They recorded Donelly's \"Rise\" with Throwing Muses' [[David Narcizo]],<ref name=Aston318/> and planned more originals, as well as a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Rufus (band)|Rufus and Chaka Khan]]'s \"[[Tell Me Something Good]]\".<ref name=Donelly72/>\n\n[[File:Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses, 1991.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tanya Donelly singing in a microphone|Tanya Donelly (shown in 1991) and Kim Deal started the Breeders after becoming friends in 1988.<ref name=Aston318/>]]\n\nA year and a half passed without the pair recording new material.<ref name=Aston318/> During this time, they decided their attempt at dance music was not working,<ref name=\"Donelly132\" /><ref name=\"Murphy131\" /> and resolved to repurpose their songs for a different genre.<ref name=Deal132/> Deal became more serious about her work with Donnelly when the Pixies' [[Black Francis]] announced he was undertaking a solo tour. She decided that if he could be active outside of the Pixies, then she could too.<ref name=Aston319>{{harvnb|Aston|2013|p=319}}</ref>\n\nJournalists have speculated that Deal felt motivated to start a

interview she complained angrily about Francis singing lead vocals in almost all of the band's songs and said that if she could not sing more in the Pixies, she would sing in another band instead.<ref>Deal, Kim in {{harvnb|Wilde|1990}}</ref> Pixies' guitarist [[Joey Santiago]] later recalled that Deal had a strong desire to contribute songs to the group to express her creativity, but eventually resigned herself and begrudgingly accepted Francis as the band's sole singer and songwriter.<ref name=\"Santiago\">Santiago, Joey in {{harvnb|Aston|1997}}</ref> According to Francis, Deal

view, Francis\u2019 own rejection of the songs reflected his attitude that the group \"made pizzas, not cookies\".<ref name=\"Santiago\"/> The latter admitted in the mid-1990s to not liking Deal's non-Pixies music, due to \"personal taste\".<ref>Francis, Black in {{harvnb|Riemenschneider|1996}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Pixies and Throwing Muses were signed to different American record labels,{{refn|The Pixies and Throwing Muses were signed to UK-based 4AD,<ref>{{harvnb|Aston|2013|pp=208, 254}}</ref> which handled UK distribution of both bands, and mainland European distribution of

To utilize the remaining time, the label hired a television crew to film a music video, and the band recorded a session for [[John Peel]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref name=Albini135/>\n\nAlbini\u2014who has worked on thousands of recordings including albums by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Page and Plant]], and [[PJ Harvey]]<ref name=\"Tingen\">{{harvnb|Tingen|2005}}</ref>\u2014describes his role as more technical than artistic, and prefers to be described as an engineer rather than producer.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/><ref name=\"Bush\">{{harvnb|Bush}}</ref> He has a preference for analogue recording techniques, and is noted for his careful placement of microphones in the studio to achieve a nuanced \"roomy\" sound. Further, in Albini's ethical approach to recording and to the mechanics of the music industry, he makes a point of not attempting to influence the band's song arrangements.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Anthony|2018}}</ref> He is known for his vocal and dim view of the music industry,<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> and the press often depicts him as not easy to work with.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/><ref name=\"Bush\"/> He has also sometimes had a reputation for being [[Misogyny|misogynist]], in part from the name of his former band [[Rapeman]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mico|1990|p=30}}</ref>\n\nDespite his reputation, Donelly recalls being especially comfortable working with Albini,<ref name=\"DonellyinMico30\">Donelly, Tanya in {{harvnb|Mico|1990|p=30}}</ref> whom she found \"sweet\".<ref name=\"Donelly134\">Donelly, Tanya in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=134}}</ref> Wiggs and Donelly have both commented that although Albini often downplays his degree of influence on an album's quality, for ''Pod'' his contributions were considerable.<ref name=Thiessen>Wiggs, Josephine in {{harvnb|Thiessen|2013}}</ref><ref name=Raible>Donelly, Tanya in {{harvnb|Raible|2016}}</ref> Donelly has praised Albini for the input that he gave the band prior to recording.<ref name=Raible/> This included convincing the band to reduce the number of vocal harmonies and give more prominence to Deal's vocals. Donelly believes the removal of harmonies made the performances \"more effective and sadder and ... focused\".<ref name=\"Donelly134\"/> Albini paid attention to capturing strong live performances in the studio.<ref name=Aston320/> His main concern was achieving the best sound, rather than seeking the best technical performances.<ref name=Wiggs/>\n\nAlbini had a policy of never doing more than two [[Take#Music recording|takes]] of each song. This led to confrontations with Donelly, who remembers: \"For all the fights we had with him in the studio, for all the times I'd stomp upstairs in my pajamas screaming that I couldn't live with such-and-such a guitar part, the next morning I realized he was usually right.\"<ref name=\"DonellyinMico30\"/> Deal also often fought with Albini. Wiggs was struck with how quickly Albini and the other musicians resolved issues through short, intense arguments, an ability she attributed to their being American.<ref>Wiggs, Josephine in {{harvnb|Mico|1990|p=30}}</ref> Albini saw Walford's drumming as an integral part of the band's sound.<ref name=Albini135/> Then 19 years old, Walford was a confident and \"hard-hitting\" drummer who typically played one of his drums behind the beat.<ref name=\"Wiggs\" /> Song tempos were faster than Wiggs had expected, which arose in part because Deal lacked the [[Vocal pedagogy#Breathing and breath support|breath control]] to sing her lines in a slower manner.<ref name=\"Wiggs\" />\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n''Pod'' has sparse instrumentation.<ref name=Brackett>{{harvnb|Wolk|2004|p=104}}</ref><ref name=Lamacq>{{harvnb|Lamacq|1990|p=34}}</ref> Music critic [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] likened the album to the Pixies for its threatening melodies and loud, resounding guitars.<ref name=Larkin>{{harvnb|Larkin|2011|p=822}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Karen Schoemer also found similarities to the Pixies, citing ''Pod''{{'}}s \"angular melodies, shattered tempos and screeching dynamics\", but felt the album nonetheless had its own identity distinct from Deal's previous band.<ref name=Schoemer>{{harvnb|Schoemer|1990}}</ref> Unlike the demo, the album does not have a country-influenced sound.<ref name=Aston320/>\n\nOther writers have noted the album's sinister, sexual<ref name=Brackett/> and youthful feel.<ref name=\"Albini135\"/> Matt LeMay of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that Deal's singing is spooky, and evokes a [[Siren (mythology)|mythical siren]] or a young girl hiding a weapon.<ref name=LeMay/> ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{\u2019}}s Ted Mico compared the tone of the songs to the innocent-looking girl in ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' who dribbles blood.<ref name=Mico29/> Albini said that \"there was a simultaneous charm to Kim's presentation to her music that's both childlike and giddy and also completely mature and kind of dirty&nbsp;... [it had a] sort of girlish fascination with things that were pretty but it was also kind of horny. That was a juxtaposition that, at the time, was unusual.

name=LeMay/> while ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Steve Lamacq cited it as an example of using reduced instrumentation to good effect (\"stripped down but punchy\").<ref name=Lamacq/>\n\nLarkin believes that the band's cover of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" achieves a friction that the original only hints at,<ref name=Larkin/> and Lamacq commented on its tight sound and prominent drum part.<ref name=Lamacq/> The Breeders recorded the song at the suggestion of Watts-Russell.<ref name=\"Aston320\" /><ref>Murphy, John in {{harvnb|Frank|2005|p=135}}</ref> \"Oh!\" has\u2014according to writer Martin Aston\u2014a slow tempo, restrained drumming, a sad violin performance by Carrie Bradley, and unexpectedly raw singing by Deal.<ref name=Aston320/> She had planned to use the title \"The

survives an abortion, and that the song is \"kinda like a heavy metal hymnal, 'We're all hellbound.{{'}}\"<ref name=DealinMico/> She cited the line \"It lives, despite the knives internal\" as containing the most embarrassing lyrics she has written.<ref>Deal, Kim in {{harvnb|Gordon|2015}}</ref> Before recording, the other band members teased her about the line, but since she could not think

For Sasha Alcott, writing for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', the song contains elements of \"fierce head-banging [[Sing-along|sing-a-long]]\" as well as gentle whimsy.<ref>Alcott, Sasha in {{harvnb|Gottlieb|2015}}</ref> About \"When I Was a Painter\", the next track, Lamacq was struck by Deal's gruff vocals and praised its stop-start guitar riff.<ref name=Lamacq/> Critic [[Rob

about strange or otherwise unsatisfying sex.<ref name=Clifton>{{harvnb|Clifton|2003|p=136}}</ref>\n\nSide 2 of the [[LP record|LP]] version starts with \"Fortunately Gone\", which Lamacq described as an appealing pop-flavored opening for the album's second half.<ref name=Lamacq/> Deal had originally practiced the song with Kelley several years previously.<ref name=DealinMico/> The lyrics concern a

being about menstruation.<ref name=Larkin/><ref name=Stenger>{{harvnb|Stenger|1991|p=89}}</ref> In a 1990 interview, Deal said the song related to something \"like a pea pod flowering and then getting ripe and stinky\", and connected it to the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]' \"associat[ing] women with fish\".<ref name=DealinMico/> The writer [[Simon Reynolds]] described Deal's wolfish, staccato

\"Opened\".<ref name=DealinMico/> The track features a buoyant rhythm<ref name=Aston320/> and was described by Stenger as exhilaratingly bringing the listener somewhere between reality and the

[[AllMusic]]'s Heather Phares characterized the recording as \"sensual\" and said that it was more benign and friendly-sounding than the Pixies.<ref name=Phares/>\n\n\"Lime House\" was described in a ''Billboard'' review as feeling \"avant-garage\".<ref>{{harvnb|Album Reviews: The Breeders \u2013 Pod}}</ref> The song concerns [[Sherlock Holmes]] spending long and comfortable hours in an [[opium

29, 1990 by 4AD.<ref>{{harvnb|The Breeders: Pod (4AD)}}</ref> Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' ''[[Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova]]'' two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.<ref name=\"Aston321\"/>  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed ''Pod'' to [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade America]].<ref name=\"Aston321\">{{harvnb|Aston|2013|p=321}}</ref> When this division of Rough Trade

receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.<ref name=\"Aston346\"/>\n\nThe album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal

Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.<ref name=Sheffield/><ref name=Kendell/><ref>{{harvnb|Van Meter|2002|p=84}}</ref> Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \"Fortunately Gone\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted ''Pod'' appealed to fans of the Pixies' \"[[Gigantic (song)|Gigantic]]\", which was written and sung by Deal.<ref name=Sheffield/><ref name=Kendell/> In AllMusic, Heather Phares described ''Pod'' as a \"vibrantly creative debut\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album ''Bossanova'', and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.<ref name=Phares/>\n\n''The Rough Guide to Rock''{{'}}s Piers Clifton and ''Melody Maker''{{'}}s Simon Reynolds viewed ''Pod'' as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \"plodding\",<ref name=Clifton/> while Reynolds felt it sounded \"inhibited, moribund, stilted\" and \"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\". Reynolds added that \"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\"<ref name=Reynolds/> Steve Taylor of ''The A to X of Alternative Music'' also found ''Pod'' inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2006|p=185}}</ref>\n\nSome reviews found ''Pod'' under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' likened it to a poorly-constructed building.<ref name=Nolan/> [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' described it unfavorably as more \"art project\" than the work of a band,<ref>{{harvnb|Christgau|1993}}</ref> and [[Greg Sandow]] in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.<ref name=Sandow/>\n\nWif Stenger of ''Trouser Press'' called the first side \"a bit shaky\" but considered side 2 to be \"damn near perfect\".<ref name=Stenger/> ''NME''{{'}}s [[Steve Lamacq]] described the album as \"a tight-ish piece of tantalising rock\", and said that listeners who found it too minimalist would soon warm to it.<ref name=Lamacq/> Karen Schoemer of ''The New York Times'' praised ''Pod''{{'}}s intelligence and originality.<ref name=Schoemer/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|alt=Nirvana members Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic onstage|Kurt Cobain was an admirer of ''Pod''.<ref name=\"Cobain1992\">{{harvnb|Cobain|1992|p=40}}</ref>]]\n\nNirvana singer [[Kurt Cobain]] often described ''Pod'' as one of his favorite albums.

It was co-produced by Daniels' [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|title='The Office' finale draws season high of 5.7 million viewers|date=May 17, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=February 17, 2019|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201113/https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:40em; font-size:85%; padding-left:5px; width:360px;\">\n'''List of showrunners throughout the series' run:'''\n\n* Season 1\u20134: [[Greg Daniels]]\n* Season 5\u20136: [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]]\n* Season 7\u20138: Paul Lieberstein\n* Season 9: Greg Daniels\n\n</div>\n[[Greg Daniels]] served as the senior series [[showrunner]] for the first four seasons of the series and developed [[The Office (British TV series)|the British ''Office'' series]] for American television.

It was co-produced by Daniels' [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006.

The most notable teams were the [[Nashville Metros]] who played from 1989 until 2012 and [[Nashville FC]], who played in the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL) from 2013 to 2016. The city also hosts two [[NCAA Division I]] [[College soccer|men's soccer]] teams, the [[Belmont Bruins men's soccer|Belmont Bruins]] and [[Lipscomb Bisons men's soccer|Lipscomb Bisons]]. The [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's soccer|Vanderbilt Commodores]] also played Division I men's soccer until the team's demise after the 2005 season.

The city also hosts two [[NCAA Division I]] [[College soccer|men's soccer]] teams, the [[Belmont Bruins men's soccer|Belmont Bruins]] and [[Lipscomb Bisons men's soccer|Lipscomb Bisons]]. The [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's soccer|Vanderbilt Commodores]] also played Division I men's soccer until the team's demise after the 2005 season.

The song was written and produced by [[R. Kelly]] and lyrically the song is about a young girl wanting to date an older man.

Critically the song was panned by many critics because of the songs controversial message about dating someone older.\n\n[[Blackground Records|Blackground]] and [[Jive Records|Jive]] released \"Age Ain't Nothing but a Number\" as the third single (and final single in the United States) from the album on December 6, 1994. Commercially the song performed poorly on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] peaking at number 75 on the chart. The song became Aaliyah's first single not to top the charts with her first two singles peaking within the top 10. On the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs  chart the song fared better peaking within the top 40 at number 5 on the week ending on December 24, 1994. Internationally the song performed moderately well peaking within the top 40 of the UK Official chart at number 32. The song experienced even greater success on the UK's Dance and R&B charts peaking within the top 20 at number 19 and 6 respectively.\n\nThe song first faced controversy after its release when a marriage certificate emerged stating that a 15-year-old Aaliyah had married a 27-year-old R. Kelly. In 1997 the song was yet again surrounded with controversy when both Aaliyah and R.Kelly were served with a lawsuit from music publisher Windswept Pacific. The music publishing company claimed that the duo illegally copied Bobby Caldwell's song \"What You Won't Do For Love\".\n\n==Composition and lyrical interpretation==\n\"Age Ain't Nothing but a Number\" has been described as a \"soulful ballad\" with Aaliyah \"crooning of longing for an older lover\".<ref name=brokenheart>{{cite web|url=http://theboombox.com/aaliyah-best-songs/|title=10 Best Songs From Aaliyah Songs|work=[[The Boombox]]|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The song opens with \"Aaliyah's spoken voice noting her daily diary entry\" and it is \"coupled with a delicate guitar-piano interplay that echoes the urgency of her performance\".<ref name=review>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/click-track/post/archives-remembering-aaliyah/2011/08/25/gIQAEjUwdJ_blog.html?noredirect=on|title=\"Age Ain\u2019t Nothin' but a Number\"|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\nIt also features a sample from Bobby Caldwell's 1978 song \"What You Won't Do For Love\".<ref name=nothing>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/Best-Songs-By-Classic-Artists/ss/Top-10-Aaliyah-Songs.htm#step3|title=Top 10 Aaliyah Songs|work=[[Dotdash]]|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Tonya Pendleton from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the song as a \"seductive entreaty to an older lover to forget their age difference and allow their relationship to ripen\".<ref name=\"review\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\nDamien Scott from [[Complex Magazine|Complex]] said that the song is a \"Head head nod-inducing track with a riding bass line that has a 15-year-old Aaliyah reprising Bobby Caldwell (\u201cI got a thing for you, and I won't let go.\u201d) to assert her assurance about her forbidden love.\".

The song was written and produced by [[R. Kelly]] and lyrically the song is about a young girl wanting to date an older man. Containing a lyrical interpolation from the song \"[[What You Won't Do For Love (song)|What You Won't Do For Love]] by [[Bobby Caldwell]]<ref name=\"ain't\">{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/the-best-aaliyah-songs/age-aint-nothing-but-a-number|title=The 25 Best Aaliyah Songs|date=May 19, 2016|work=[[Complex magazine|Complex]]|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}</ref> the \"soulful\" ballad opens with a guitar-piano interplay, with Aaliyah's spoken voice noting her daily diary entry. Critically the song was panned by many critics because of the songs controversial message about dating someone older.\n\n[[Blackground Records|Blackground]] and [[Jive Records|Jive]] released \"Age Ain't Nothing but a Number\" as the third single (and final single in the United States) from the album on December 6, 1994. Commercially the song performed poorly on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] peaking at number 75 on the chart. The song became Aaliyah's first single not to top the charts with her first two singles peaking within the top 10. On the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs  chart the song fared better peaking within the top 40 at number 5 on the week ending on December 24, 1994. Internationally the song performed moderately well peaking within the top 40 of the UK Official chart at number 32. The song experienced even greater success on the UK's Dance and R&B charts peaking within the top 20 at number 19 and 6 respectively.\n\nThe song first faced controversy after its release when a marriage certificate emerged stating that a 15-year-old Aaliyah had married a 27-year-old R. Kelly. In 1997 the song was yet again surrounded with controversy when both Aaliyah and R.Kelly were served with a lawsuit from music publisher Windswept Pacific. The music publishing company claimed that the duo illegally copied Bobby Caldwell's song \"What You Won't Do For Love\".\n\n==Composition and lyrical interpretation==\n\"Age Ain't Nothing but a Number\" has been described as a \"soulful ballad\" with Aaliyah \"crooning of longing for an older lover\".<ref name=brokenheart>{{cite web|url=http://theboombox.com/aaliyah-best-songs/|title=10 Best Songs From Aaliyah Songs|work=[[The Boombox]]|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The song opens with \"Aaliyah's spoken voice noting her daily diary entry\" and it is \"coupled with a delicate guitar-piano interplay that echoes the urgency of her performance\".<ref name=review>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/click-track/post/archives-remembering-aaliyah/2011/08/25/gIQAEjUwdJ_blog.html?noredirect=on|title=\"Age Ain\u2019t Nothin' but a Number\"|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\nIt also features a sample from Bobby Caldwell's 1978 song \"What You Won't Do For Love\".<ref name=nothing>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/Best-Songs-By-Classic-Artists/ss/Top-10-Aaliyah-Songs.htm#step3|title=Top 10 Aaliyah Songs|work=[[Dotdash]]|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Tonya Pendleton from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the song as a \"seductive entreaty to an older lover to forget their age difference and allow their relationship to ripen\".<ref name=\"review\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\nDamien Scott from [[Complex Magazine|Complex]] said that the song is a \"Head head nod-inducing track with a riding bass line that has a 15-year-old Aaliyah reprising Bobby Caldwell (\u201cI got a thing for you, and I won't let go.\u201d) to assert her assurance about her forbidden love.\".
