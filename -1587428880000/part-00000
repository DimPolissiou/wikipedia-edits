The company established a library and its [[Clockmakers' Museum|Museum]] in 1813, which is the oldest specific collection of clocks and watches worldwide.<ref>https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/clockmakers-museum</ref> This is administered by the company's affiliated charity, the Clockmakers\u2019 Charity,<ref>Charity No. 275380 registered with the UK Charity Commission</ref> and is presently housed on the second floor of London's [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]. The modern aims of the company and its Museum are charitable and educational, in particular to promote and preserve clockmaking and watchmaking, which as of 2019 were added to the [[HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts]].\n\n==Museum==\nThe [[Clockmakers' Museum|Clockmakers\u2019 Museum]], first established in 1813, was housed at London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] from 1874 to 2014. The collection of clocks and watches was moved to a new gallery provided by the Science Museum, officially opened by HRH [[Princess Anne]] on 22 October 2015. The company's archive and library are however still kept at [[Guildhall Library]]. The collection includes [[John Harrison|John Harrison's]] sea watch H5, once personally tested by [[King George III]].\n\n==Motto==\nThe company's motto, ''Tempus Rerum Imperator'', can be translated as \u2018Time, the Ruler of All Things\u2019. It appears as an epitaph on the tombstone of former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], a liveryman of the company. It has also been adopted by the [[Google Web Accelerator]] project.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the seventeenth century, clockmaking by native English craftsmen was mostly confined to the production of [[turret clocks]]. Domestic clocks and watches were mostly imported or the work of immigrants from the Continent. Because turret clock making involved working in ferrous metal, clockmakers within the City of London tended to be freemen of the [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths|Blacksmiths\u2019 Company]], though some were members of other livery companies, notably the [[Worshipful Company of Clothworkers|Clothworkers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Lantern Clocks|last=White|first=George|publisher=ACC|year=1989|location=|pages=51\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the loss of many London clock and watchmakers in the plagues of 1598 and 1603, the trade consolidated and began to grow. The continued influx of newcomers led to resentment from those who had become established in London towards outsiders who came to set up in or near the City and who threatened their market. From 1620 onwards, groups of clockmakers attempted to set up their own guild. The Blacksmiths initially succeeded in opposing these moves. Eventually, however, with the King issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a Royal Charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clockmakers of London|last=White|first=George|publisher=WCC|year=2018|location=London|pages=14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe Charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have \u2018continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking\u2019. It provided that the Fellowship should be governed by a Master, three Wardens and ten or more Assistants who would form the Court. The first Master was [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]], a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to [[James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England. The noted clockmaker [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]] also formed part of the first Court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|last=Atkins|first=Samuel|publisher=|year=1881|location=London|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nThe original Charter is still in the company's possession and is housed with the rest of its library and archive in the Guildhall Library.<ref>See the catalogue of the London Metropolitan Archive, reference CLC/L/CD</ref>\nThe company obtained a [[grant of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]] in January 1672. In 1766, the [[Court of Aldermen]] granted the Company its livery. The number of Liverymen was originally limited at sixty but has been increased in number over the years by approval of the [[City of London Corporation]] and currently stands at a maximum of three hundred.<ref>http://www.clockmakers.org/history-customs/freedom-and-livery/</ref>\n\n==Horological Training and Awards for Excellence==\nThe company bestows three awards for excellence: the Tompion Medal for outstanding achievements in horology, the Harrison Medal for the propagation of horological knowledge and its appreciation, and the Derek Pratt Prize for innovation, ingenuity, elegance, and the highest standards of workmanship and precision performance in the craft and science of time and timekeeping.\nThe company also closely co-operates with the trustees of the [[George Daniels (watchmaker)|George Daniels]] Educational Trust in supporting education in horology.\n\n==Affiliations==\nThe Clockmakers Company is formally affiliated with the [[Antiquarian Horological Society]], the [[UCL Observatory]], [[HMS Protector (A173)|HMS ''Protector'']], the Royal Navy's Ice Patrol Ship.<ref>http://www.clockmakers.org/about/affiliations/</ref> and [[HMS Archer|HMS ''Archer'']], a P264 Class University Royal Naval Unit based in Edinburgh.\n\n==Masters==\n[[File:Reverend Henry Leonard Nelthropp.jpg|thumb|The Reverend Henry Leonard Nelthropp MA FSA, Master of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of the City of London 1893 and 1894.]]\n[[File:City of London, unusually arranged clock - geograph.org.uk - 559842.jpg|thumb|The [[Newgate|Newgate Street]] clock, the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers' 375th anniversary gift to the City of London.]]\nThose who have been Master of the company include the following:<ref>[http://www.clockmakers.org/about/the-court-committees-panels/masters-since-1631/ Masters since 1631], The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers website, accessed 06/02/2011</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*1631, [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]]\n*1636, [[Elias Allen]]\n*1645, 1652 [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]]\n*1700, [[Charles Gretton]]<ref>[Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila.

Eventually, however, with the King issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a Royal Charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clockmakers of London|last=White|first=George|publisher=WCC|year=2018|location=London|pages=14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe Charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have \u2018continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking\u2019. It provided that the Fellowship should be governed by a Master, three Wardens and ten or more Assistants who would form the Court. The first Master was [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]], a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to [[James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England. The noted clockmaker [[Edward East (clockmaker)|Edward East]] also formed part of the first Court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Account of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|last=Atkins|first=Samuel|publisher=|year=1881|location=London|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nThe original Charter is still in the company's possession and is housed with the rest of its library and archive in the Guildhall Library.<ref>See the catalogue of the London Metropolitan Archive, reference CLC/L/CD</ref>\nThe company obtained a [[grant of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]] in January 1672.

It is around {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} [[Points of the compass|south-southwest]] of [[Charing Cross]]. Morden adjoins [[Merton Park]] and [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] to the north, [[Mitcham, London|Mitcham]] to the east, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] to the south and [[Worcester Park]] to the west. It is also famous as the homeplace of famous hula hoopers Katie Duck, Eira Evans and Karolina Caires.\n\nMorden had a population of 48,233 in 2011, including the wards of Cannon Hill, [[Lower Morden]], Merton Park, Ravensbury and St Helier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202755/http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Origin of name ==\nMorden's name may be derived from the [[Common Brittonic]] words ''Mawr'' (great or large) and ''Dun'' (fort), or possibly \"The Town on the Moor\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nHuman activity in Morden dates back to the [[Iron Age]] period when [[Celt]]ic tribes are known to have occupied areas around [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], but the first significant development in Morden was the construction of the [[Roman road]] called [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]] from [[Chichester]] to [[London]].\n\nThe route of [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]] through Morden followed the current [[A24 road (Great Britain)|A24]], London Road up Stonecot Hill from the south west crossing [[Morden Park]] to the west of the current [[dual carriageway]] road and passing through the pitch and putt golf course and the grounds of [[St Lawrence Church, Morden|St Lawrence's Church]]. The road then descended the other side of the hill towards the town centre passing west of the [[Morden tube station|Underground station]] and crossing the north corner of [[Morden Hall Park]] heading in the direction of [[Colliers Wood]] and [[Tooting]]. Small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], mainly coins and pottery, have been found at various locations within the area although there is no evidence of any settlement.\n\nEthelstan the Etheling, son of [[Ethelred the Unready]], left \"land at Mordune\" to the [[abbey]] of Christ and St. Peter in his will of 1015, which became the site of the first [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] parish church of [[St Lawrence]].\n\nIn 1086, the [[Domesday Book]] recorded the manor as ''Mordone'', part of [[Wallington (hundred)|Wallington]] [[Hundred (country subdivision)|Hundred]]. It was held by [[Westminster Abbey]] and its assets were: 3 [[hide (unit)|hides]]; 1 [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] worth \u00a32 and 7 [[plough]]s. It rendered \u00a315.<ref>[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015325/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |date=15 July 2007 }}</ref> in total.

While the population of [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] grew hugely from 1,591 in 1801 to 41,652 in 1901, the population of Morden was 512 in 1801 and, one hundred years later, had grown to just 960.<ref name = census>UK Census records</ref>\n\nIn 1871, the area of the parish of Morden was {{convert|1474.926|acre|km2|3}}<ref name = os_1871>[[Ordnance Survey]] map, 1871 edition</ref> with the small village clustered around [[St Lawrence Church, Morden|St Lawrence's church]] at the top of the hill on the road from London to [[Epsom]] (now London Road/Epsom Road). Approximately half a mile to the west of the main village and the grounds of [[Morden Park]] stood the hamlet of [[Lower Morden]].\n\nClose to the church were the George Inn, a 17th-century [[coaching inn]] (now modernised and part of a national pub restaurant chain), the estate of [[Morden Park]] and a school.\n\nThe other main public house in the village was the Crown Inn, located to the north east of the village with a small cluster of cottages on Crown Road. The rest of what is now the commercial centre of Morden was fields.\n\nIn the late 19th century the principal industry remained agriculture, although some industrial activity did exist along the [[River Wandle]] where [[watermill]]s ground tobacco to [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] and a varnish works existed close to the site of Poplar Primary School. By 1898, the varnish works had gone and there was a [[brickworks]]<ref name = os_1898>Ordnance Survey map, 1898 edition</ref> on the site of Mostyn Gardens in Martin Way (then called Green Lane).<ref name = os_1898/>\n\n===20th century===\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 1894|Local Government Act, 1894]], the parish of Morden formed part of the [[Croydon Rural District]] of [[Surrey]]. The first two decades of the 20th century saw little change in the village, with industry still mainly agricultural in nature; however development in the parish of [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] to the north led to that area being removed from the [[rural district]] to form the [[Merton Urban District]] in 1907. Morden was merged with the Merton Urban District, in 1913, to form the [[Merton and Morden Urban District]].<ref name = vob>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10036574 VisionofBritain.org.uk]</ref> It was not, until 1926, when [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground station]] opened as the terminus of a new extension of the [[City & South London Railway]] (now part of the [[London Underground]]'s [[Northern line]]), that the fast and direct route to Central [[London]] opened up the village for residential development.\n\nTo complement the new station, a garage was constructed on the other side of London Road, adjacent to the railway cutting and, in 1932, Morden Cinema was built next to it on the corner of Aberconway Road. Around the station a new commercial centre grew quickly as shops sprang up along London Road and Crown Lane, including a rebuilt and enlarged Crown public house (opened in 1932)<ref name=my_merton>[http://www.merton.gov.uk/my_merton_17_lr.pdf my merton, issue 17, June-July 2006, p. 17]</ref> and a large [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] (RACS) department store (opened in 1940).<ref name=my_merton/>\n\nAway from the new commercial centre of Morden, the existing rural roads were widened and rebuilt and the fields were rapidly divided into building plots and laid out for new housing.  Further transport improvements came with the construction of a new [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] branch line [[Wimbledon and Sutton Railway|from Wimbledon to Sutton]] via stations at [[South Merton railway station|South Merton]] and [[Morden South railway station|Morden South]] (so named to differentiate it from [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground Station]] and [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Station]] (now Morden Road tram stop), although it was actually north east of the original village centre). The new line opened in January 1930. As a result of the new transport links, the population of Morden increased rapidly from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931. In the next fifteen years, the population continued to grow, as most of the parish was covered in new [[suburban]] homes.\n\nOne of the main residential developments in the 1930s was the [[St. Helier, London|St. Helier]] estate, built by the [[London County Council]] (LCC) to house workers from Inner London and named in honour of Lady St. Helier, an [[alderman]] of the LCC. The estate was at the time the largest local authority development in South London and has its road names arranged in alphabetical order, from the north-west corner ([[Abbotsbury]] Road) to the south-east corner ([[Woburn Abbey|Woburn]] Road). Reflecting the previous ownership of the land by [[Westminster Abbey]], all are named after religious establishments. \n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n|[[File:Mordenmap 1920s.png|thumb|200px|A map of Morden from the 1920s]] || [[File:Morden map 1944.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Morden from 1944]]\n|}\nIn 1943, the council was granted a civic [[coat-of-arms]] incorporating lions from the Garth family arms and the fret from the arms of [[Merton Priory]]. The motto, ''\"In Libertate Vis\"'', means ''\"Our Strength is our Freedom\"''. In 1965, under the [[London Government Act 1963]], the Merton and Morden Urban District Council was abolished and its area combined with that of the [[Municipal Borough of Wimbledon]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Mitcham]] to form the present-day London Borough of Merton.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:White Bridge, Morden Hall Park.jpg|thumb|Morden Hall Park, 5 minutes walk from the town centre.]]\n[[File:MordenHall.jpg|right|thumb|Morden Hall]]\n\nDespite London's suburban expansion, a little of the earlier rural nature of Morden has survived; for instance several grand period buildings remain, especially within Morden's parks.  The area retains a good provision of parks and green spaces, many of them created from former country estates. The 125 acre [[Morden Hall Park]] is of particular note and is run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] (see below).  Its main entrance is only a quarter-of-a-mile from Morden Underground Station.\n\nThe largest building in the town centre is Crown House, sixties-built and 14 storeys tall; designed in 1959 by A. Green ARIBA and built between 1960 and 1962. The concaved frontage of the building lends it some distinction, as does the \"chessboard\" style juxtaposition of its light and dark facade features. It incorporated The Crown [[public house]], on which site part of the building covered. The building is home to Merton Council's civic centre and a large adjoining library.\n\nAt around the same time, Morden Underground Station, originally a single storey building, with shops, had three-storey office accommodation incorporated above it.\n\nA further office building with a large supermarket (now a [[Sainsbury's]]) at ground-floor level was built in the 1980s at the other end of the town centre.\n\nThe cinema and adjoining garage were demolished and replaced by shops some years ago.\n\n==Landmarks==\n\nMorden plays host to a number of buildings and parks worthy of note including:\n\n[[File:Baitul Futuh back.jpg|thumb|[[Baitul Futuh]] Mosque]]\n*The [[Baitul Futuh|Bait'ul Futuh]] Mosque, the largest mosque in Western Europe, built by the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. Completed in 2003 at a cost of approximately \u00a35.5 million, the mosque covers an area of 5.2 acres (21,000 m2) and the full complex can accommodate up to 10,000 worshippers. It was voted one of the top 50 buildings in the world by ''[[Spectator Magazine]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}} It is located  next to Morden South railway station and approximately 700 yards from Morden Underground station.\n*[[Morden Hall Park]] is a key feature of the Morden area with large, period buildings located within its boundaries. It is a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] park, and is located on the banks of the [[River Wandle]], near the town centre and few hundred yards from Morden Underground station.  It covers over 50ha (125 acres) of parkland with the River Wandle meandering through it spanned by numerous foot-bridges. The estate contains a number of historic buildings including Morden Hall itself, Morden Cottage, an old Snuff Mill, and many old farm buildings, some of which are now a garden centre and a city farm. The rose garden has over 2000 roses. The estate land was originally owned by Westminster Abbey. There is evidence of an earlier manor-house, but Morden Hall dates back to the 1770s and contains a variety of natural landscapes, including the parkland of the \"Deer Park\", meadow and marshland.\n[[File:Morden Park House.JPG|thumb|right|Morden Park House]]\n*[[Morden Park]], another park containing a  period building of note. The park includes land that previously formed the grounds of Morden Park House, a small 18th-century country estate. The Georgian country house was built at the top of the hill in the 1770s for merchant and distiller John Ewart with attached landscaped gardens.\n[[File:St Lawrence Church, Morden-Geograph-4321087-by-Stephen-Craven.jpg|thumb|[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]]]]\n*[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]].  St Lawrence Church is the Church of England parish church for Morden.  The building is [[Grade I listed]],<ref>{{NHLE|num=1080899 |desc=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> and located on London Road, at the highest point of Morden, overlooking Morden Park.

Morden adjoins [[Merton Park]] and [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] to the north, [[Mitcham, London|Mitcham]] to the east, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] to the south and [[Worcester Park]] to the west. \n\nMorden had a population of 48,233 in 2011, including the wards of Cannon Hill, [[Lower Morden]], Merton Park, Ravensbury and St Helier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222202755/http://data.london.gov.uk/2011-census-ward-pop |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Origin of name ==\nMorden's name may be derived from the [[Common Brittonic]] words ''Mawr'' (great or large) and ''Dun'' (fort), or possibly \"The Town on the Moor\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nHuman activity in Morden dates back to the [[Iron Age]] period when [[Celt]]ic tribes are known to have occupied areas around [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], but the first significant development in Morden was the construction of the [[Roman road]] called [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]] from [[Chichester]] to [[London]].\n\nThe route of [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]] through Morden followed the current [[A24 road (Great Britain)|A24]], London Road up Stonecot Hill from the south west crossing [[Morden Park]] to the west of the current [[dual carriageway]] road and passing through the pitch and putt golf course and the grounds of [[St Lawrence Church, Morden|St Lawrence's Church]]. The road then descended the other side of the hill towards the town centre passing west of the [[Morden tube station|Underground station]] and crossing the north corner of [[Morden Hall Park]] heading in the direction of [[Colliers Wood]] and [[Tooting]]. Small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], mainly coins and pottery, have been found at various locations within the area although there is no evidence of any settlement.\n\nEthelstan the Etheling, son of [[Ethelred the Unready]], left \"land at Mordune\" to the [[abbey]] of Christ and St. Peter in his will of 1015, which became the site of the first [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] parish church of [[St Lawrence]].\n\nIn 1086, the [[Domesday Book]] recorded the manor as ''Mordone'', part of [[Wallington (hundred)|Wallington]] [[Hundred (country subdivision)|Hundred]]. It was held by [[Westminster Abbey]] and its assets were: 3 [[hide (unit)|hides]]; 1 [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] worth \u00a32 and 7 [[plough]]s. It rendered \u00a315.<ref>[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015325/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |date=15 July 2007 }}</ref> in total.

While the population of [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] grew hugely from 1,591 in 1801 to 41,652 in 1901, the population of Morden was 512 in 1801 and, one hundred years later, had grown to just 960.<ref name = census>UK Census records</ref>\n\nIn 1871, the area of the parish of Morden was {{convert|1474.926|acre|km2|3}}<ref name = os_1871>[[Ordnance Survey]] map, 1871 edition</ref> with the small village clustered around [[St Lawrence Church, Morden|St Lawrence's church]] at the top of the hill on the road from London to [[Epsom]] (now London Road/Epsom Road). Approximately half a mile to the west of the main village and the grounds of [[Morden Park]] stood the hamlet of [[Lower Morden]].\n\nClose to the church were the George Inn, a 17th-century [[coaching inn]] (now modernised and part of a national pub restaurant chain), the estate of [[Morden Park]] and a school.\n\nThe other main public house in the village was the Crown Inn, located to the north east of the village with a small cluster of cottages on Crown Road. The rest of what is now the commercial centre of Morden was fields.\n\nIn the late 19th century the principal industry remained agriculture, although some industrial activity did exist along the [[River Wandle]] where [[watermill]]s ground tobacco to [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] and a varnish works existed close to the site of Poplar Primary School. By 1898, the varnish works had gone and there was a [[brickworks]]<ref name = os_1898>Ordnance Survey map, 1898 edition</ref> on the site of Mostyn Gardens in Martin Way (then called Green Lane).<ref name = os_1898/>\n\n===20th century===\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 1894|Local Government Act, 1894]], the parish of Morden formed part of the [[Croydon Rural District]] of [[Surrey]]. The first two decades of the 20th century saw little change in the village, with industry still mainly agricultural in nature; however development in the parish of [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] to the north led to that area being removed from the [[rural district]] to form the [[Merton Urban District]] in 1907. Morden was merged with the Merton Urban District, in 1913, to form the [[Merton and Morden Urban District]].<ref name = vob>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10036574 VisionofBritain.org.uk]</ref> It was not, until 1926, when [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground station]] opened as the terminus of a new extension of the [[City & South London Railway]] (now part of the [[London Underground]]'s [[Northern line]]), that the fast and direct route to Central [[London]] opened up the village for residential development.\n\nTo complement the new station, a garage was constructed on the other side of London Road, adjacent to the railway cutting and, in 1932, Morden Cinema was built next to it on the corner of Aberconway Road. Around the station a new commercial centre grew quickly as shops sprang up along London Road and Crown Lane, including a rebuilt and enlarged Crown public house (opened in 1932)<ref name=my_merton>[http://www.merton.gov.uk/my_merton_17_lr.pdf my merton, issue 17, June-July 2006, p. 17]</ref> and a large [[Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society]] (RACS) department store (opened in 1940).<ref name=my_merton/>\n\nAway from the new commercial centre of Morden, the existing rural roads were widened and rebuilt and the fields were rapidly divided into building plots and laid out for new housing.  Further transport improvements came with the construction of a new [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] branch line [[Wimbledon and Sutton Railway|from Wimbledon to Sutton]] via stations at [[South Merton railway station|South Merton]] and [[Morden South railway station|Morden South]] (so named to differentiate it from [[Morden tube station|Morden Underground Station]] and [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Station]] (now Morden Road tram stop), although it was actually north east of the original village centre). The new line opened in January 1930. As a result of the new transport links, the population of Morden increased rapidly from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931. In the next fifteen years, the population continued to grow, as most of the parish was covered in new [[suburban]] homes.\n\nOne of the main residential developments in the 1930s was the [[St. Helier, London|St. Helier]] estate, built by the [[London County Council]] (LCC) to house workers from Inner London and named in honour of Lady St. Helier, an [[alderman]] of the LCC. The estate was at the time the largest local authority development in South London and has its road names arranged in alphabetical order, from the north-west corner ([[Abbotsbury]] Road) to the south-east corner ([[Woburn Abbey|Woburn]] Road). Reflecting the previous ownership of the land by [[Westminster Abbey]], all are named after religious establishments. \n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n|[[File:Mordenmap 1920s.png|thumb|200px|A map of Morden from the 1920s]] || [[File:Morden map 1944.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Morden from 1944]]\n|}\nIn 1943, the council was granted a civic [[coat-of-arms]] incorporating lions from the Garth family arms and the fret from the arms of [[Merton Priory]]. The motto, ''\"In Libertate Vis\"'', means ''\"Our Strength is our Freedom\"''. In 1965, under the [[London Government Act 1963]], the Merton and Morden Urban District Council was abolished and its area combined with that of the [[Municipal Borough of Wimbledon]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Mitcham]] to form the present-day London Borough of Merton.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:White Bridge, Morden Hall Park.jpg|thumb|Morden Hall Park, 5 minutes walk from the town centre.]]\n[[File:MordenHall.jpg|right|thumb|Morden Hall]]\n\nDespite London's suburban expansion, a little of the earlier rural nature of Morden has survived; for instance several grand period buildings remain, especially within Morden's parks.  The area retains a good provision of parks and green spaces, many of them created from former country estates. The 125 acre [[Morden Hall Park]] is of particular note and is run by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] (see below).  Its main entrance is only a quarter-of-a-mile from Morden Underground Station.\n\nThe largest building in the town centre is Crown House, sixties-built and 14 storeys tall; designed in 1959 by A. Green ARIBA and built between 1960 and 1962. The concaved frontage of the building lends it some distinction, as does the \"chessboard\" style juxtaposition of its light and dark facade features. It incorporated The Crown [[public house]], on which site part of the building covered. The building is home to Merton Council's civic centre and a large adjoining library.\n\nAt around the same time, Morden Underground Station, originally a single storey building, with shops, had three-storey office accommodation incorporated above it.\n\nA further office building with a large supermarket (now a [[Sainsbury's]]) at ground-floor level was built in the 1980s at the other end of the town centre.\n\nThe cinema and adjoining garage were demolished and replaced by shops some years ago.\n\n==Landmarks==\n\nMorden plays host to a number of buildings and parks worthy of note including:\n\n[[File:Baitul Futuh back.jpg|thumb|[[Baitul Futuh]] Mosque]]\n*The [[Baitul Futuh|Bait'ul Futuh]] Mosque, the largest mosque in Western Europe, built by the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. Completed in 2003 at a cost of approximately \u00a35.5 million, the mosque covers an area of 5.2 acres (21,000 m2) and the full complex can accommodate up to 10,000 worshippers. It was voted one of the top 50 buildings in the world by ''[[Spectator Magazine]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}} It is located  next to Morden South railway station and approximately 700 yards from Morden Underground station.\n*[[Morden Hall Park]] is a key feature of the Morden area with large, period buildings located within its boundaries. It is a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] park, and is located on the banks of the [[River Wandle]], near the town centre and few hundred yards from Morden Underground station.  It covers over 50ha (125 acres) of parkland with the River Wandle meandering through it spanned by numerous foot-bridges. The estate contains a number of historic buildings including Morden Hall itself, Morden Cottage, an old Snuff Mill, and many old farm buildings, some of which are now a garden centre and a city farm. The rose garden has over 2000 roses. The estate land was originally owned by Westminster Abbey. There is evidence of an earlier manor-house, but Morden Hall dates back to the 1770s and contains a variety of natural landscapes, including the parkland of the \"Deer Park\", meadow and marshland.\n[[File:Morden Park House.JPG|thumb|right|Morden Park House]]\n*[[Morden Park]], another park containing a  period building of note. The park includes land that previously formed the grounds of Morden Park House, a small 18th-century country estate. The Georgian country house was built at the top of the hill in the 1770s for merchant and distiller John Ewart with attached landscaped gardens.\n[[File:St Lawrence Church, Morden-Geograph-4321087-by-Stephen-Craven.jpg|thumb|[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]]]]\n*[[St Lawrence Church, Morden]].  St Lawrence Church is the Church of England parish church for Morden.  The building is [[Grade I listed]],<ref>{{NHLE|num=1080899 |desc=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> and located on London Road, at the highest point of Morden, overlooking Morden Park.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after).

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad.

The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident.

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

In its debut appearance, Mechagodzilla is depicted as an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] villain that confronts [[Godzilla]]. In subsequent iterations, Mechagodzilla is usually depicted as a man-made weapon designed to defend [[Japan]] from Godzilla. In all incarnations, the character is portrayed as a robotic [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] with a vast array of weaponry, and along with [[King Ghidorah]], is commonly considered to be an archenemy of Godzilla.\n\n==Overview==\n===Development===\nMechagodzilla was conceived in 1974 as a more serious villain than its immediate two predecessors, [[Gigan]] and [[Megalon]], whose films were considered creative disasters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=195}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=196}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=197}} According to [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]], Mechagodzilla was inspired by both [[Mechani-Kong]] from the previous [[Toho]] film ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' and the [[Mecha anime and manga|robot anime]] genre, which was popular at the time.<ref name=\"\u5143\u5c71\u638c\">{{cite book |authors=\u5143\u5c71\u638c\u3001\u677e\u91ce\u672c\u548c\u5f18\u3001\u6d45\u4e95\u548c\u5eb7\u3001\u9234\u6728\u5ba3\u5b5d  |script-title=ja:\u300e\u6771\u5b9d\u7279\u64ae\u6620\u753b\u5927\u5168\u96c6\u300f \u30f4\u30a3\u30ec\u30c3\u30b8\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 |year=2012 |isbn=9784864910132}}</ref> Effects director [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] also felt that a mechanical monster was cheaper to construct than the mutated animals Godzilla had previously faced.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=137}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=138}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=139}} As the resulting ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' proved to be a greater critical success than previous 1970s ''Godzilla'' films, the character was revived in 1975's ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. The film's screenplay was based on the winning entry of a story-writing competition won by Yukiko Takayama, who continued the darker tone of the previous film by adding the subplot of Mechagodzilla being cybernetically connected to a young woman. Mechagodzilla's design remained largely unchanged from its previous appearance, though it was made to look thinner and more angular, with a darker sheen and an MG2 insignia emblazoned on its upper arms. The film's original draft was going to have Mechagodzilla destroy Tokyo utterly, though the destruction was cut down for budgetary reasons.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=200-6}}\n[[File:Heisei Godzilla Perfection - Berserk.jpg|thumb|right|Early concept art of Mechagodzilla's Heisei incarnation, dubbed \"Berserk\"]]\n\nMechagodzilla was brought back in 1993's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'', as the success of ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' and the popularity of its main antagonist [[Mothra]] spurred Toho into reintroducing familiar characters rather than inventing new ones.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=287-93}} Originally, the new Mechagodzilla was to be named \"Berserk\", and was envisioned as being a much more organic Godzilla-like creature which would later turn on its creators after becoming infected with a [[computer virus]] which makes it self-aware. Berserk would subsequently absorb more and more machinery, to the point of degenerating into a mass of metal and wires, though this concept was rejected early in pre-production.<ref name=\"kawakita\">{{cite book |script-title=ja:\u5e73\u6210\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af [Heisei Godzilla Perfection]|last=Kawakita|first=Koichi |year=2012 |publisher=Dengeki Hobby Books |isbn=4048861190 |pages=|language=ja}}</ref> As Mechagodzilla was intended to be a military defense weapon rather than an alien construct, the character was redesigned as looking sleeker and smoother.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=287-93}} It was portrayed by suit actor [[Wataru Fukuda]], and consisted of multiple separate elements which were worn like plate armor. Special effects artist [[Koichi Kawakita]] originally envisioned Mechagodzilla being able to split into aerial and terrestrial units, though this idea was scrapped in favor of the character merging with the flying battleship Garuda. The film was promoted through the children's program ''Adventure Godzilla-land'', which portrayed Godzilla and Mechagodzilla as rival news anchors reporting on the events of the upcoming movie.<ref name=\"kalat2010.2\">{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=196\u2013201|edition=2nd}}</ref> Composer [[Akira Ifukube]] wrote a theme for Mechagodzilla incorporating a slow battle march with heavy percussion and [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic phrasing]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=287-93}}\n\nThe decision to incorporate Mechagodzilla into the Millennium series was taken by producer [[Sh\u014dgo Tomiyama]], who gave the general outline of what would become the story of ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' to ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]'' director Masaaki Tezuka.<ref name=\"tezuka2014\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0toUtvfWMPg |trans-title=\"Tokyo SOS Director EXTRA |script-title=ja:\u6771\u4eacSOS\u306e\u76e3\u7763\u301cEXTRA\u301c (SciFi Japan TV #27) |publisher=CHO Japan |date=September 2014}}</ref> Tezuka instructed his staff to research both [[cybernetics]] and DNA engineering in order to make the character scientifically plausible. Tezuka had initially wanted Mechagodzilla to be a much speedier robot than the one on film, envisioning it as becoming progressively more agile during its fight against Godzilla as the latter tore off its opponent's armaments. This incarnation of Mechagodzilla was deliberately shown being airlifted by carriers rather than flying directly into battle as the previous two incarnations had done, as Tezuka felt that it made little sense for Mechagodzilla to drain its energy in such a manner. Upon being asked why the Mechagodzilla suit wasn't painted with [[military camouflage]] colors, Tezuka answered that \"Mechagodzilla doesn't need to hide.\"<ref>[http://www.henshinonline.com/tezuka-mimura.html \"Interview: Masaaki Tezuka and Wataru Mimura\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701043428/http://www.henshinonline.com/tezuka-mimura.html |date=2016-07-01 }}, ''henshionline'' (accessed 2016-26-05)</ref> Tezuka had originally intended to have both Godzilla and Mechagodzilla die at the end of the film, but was forced to change this on the insistence of Toho managers, who felt that such an ending was too dark for a [[New Year]] movie release.<ref name=\"tezuka2014\"/>\n\nIn the 2003 sequel ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', creature designer Shinichi Wakasa used the same mold to create a redesigned Mechagodzilla, which was meant to look more weathered than its predecessor. According to production designer Shinki Nishikawa, several other changes were made to the Mechagodzilla design's head, chest and arms in order to make the character look less heroic and more machine-like. The robot's back unit was reduced in size and flipped upside down, and the head was made smaller. As the previous design's shoulder cannons were considered uneven and unsophisticated-looking because of their rectangular shape, special effects director Eiichi Asada made them more pentagonal. As the character was supposed to rely more on its forearm cannons than in the previous film, Nishikawa made them larger and more powerful looking.<ref>\"Godzilla X Mothra X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo SOS production report - The men behind the monsters discuss the latest Godzilla film\", ''Uchusen'' #108 (Asahi Sonorama) (October 22, 2003)</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\n[[File:Mechagodzilla Absolute Zero.png|thumb|The Millennium Mechagodzilla's Absolute Zero Cannon featured in ''Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla'' (2002)]]\nThe Showa Mechagodzilla stands {{convert|50|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} in height and weighs 40,000 metric tons.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=196}} It is built from \"space [[titanium]]\", and is capable of launching missiles from its fingers, toes and knees, as well as firing energy beams from its eyes and chest unit.

First appearing in a pseudo-flesh outer covering and masquerading as the real Godzilla, Mechagodzilla attacks Japan and overpowers Godzilla's ally [[Anguirus]]. Godzilla appears and destroys the pseudo-flesh disguise, forcing Mechagodzilla to reveal itself in full. Their initial battle results in a tie, as Godzilla is severely wounded and Mechagodzilla is forced back into the Simian's base for repair. Mechagodzilla is deployed again but is overpowered through the combined efforts of Godzilla and [[King Caesar]]. Godzilla ultimately defeats Mechagodzilla by decapitating it and blowing its body apart.\n\nThe Simians return and rebuild Mechagodzilla in ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. This time, it is further modified with living human brain cells and has its control circuitry integrated into the body of the human woman Katsura Mafune, who is a [[cyborg]] courtesy of the aliens. Mechagodzilla is teamed up with the dinosaur [[Titanosaurus (Godzilla)|Titanosaurus]], who is controlled by Katsura's crazed father. Although Mechagodzilla survives another decapitation during a battle against Godzilla, it is once more defeated after Katsura commits suicide, destroying the robot's controls and freezing it long enough for Godzilla to use its atomic heat ray on Mechagodzilla's headless body, causing it to explode.\n[[File:Heisei Mechagodzilla.png|thumb|Heisei Mechagodzilla]]\n\n===Heisei period (1993)===\nIn ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'', Mechagodzilla is built as an anti-Godzilla weapon by the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center using 23rd century technology [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the remains of [[King Ghidorah|Mecha-King Ghidorah]]. Mechagodzilla overpowers Godzilla in Kyoto, but is rendered harmless by a voltage backsurge caused by Godzilla. Mechagodzilla is recovered and merged with the smaller airship Garuda to form {{nihongo|'''Super-Mechagodzilla'''|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30e1\u30ab\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9|Supa-Mekagojira}}. This combined mecha later fights both [[Rodan|Fire Rodan]] and Godzilla. It proceeds to cripple Godzilla by destroying its secondary brain and mortally wounds Rodan. Rodan then sacrifices its energy to revive Godzilla, who then uses its new red spiral atomic breath to destroy the weakened Super-Mechagodzilla.\n\nIn ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', it is revealed that Mechagodzilla's remains were salvaged and used to construct [[Moguera]].\n[[File:Millennium Mechagodzilla.png|thumb|Millennium Mechagodzilla]]\n\n===Millennium period (2002\u20132003)===\nThe Millennium incarnation is featured in two films: ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' and is referenced as {{nihongo|'''Kiryu'''|\u6a5f\u9f8d|Kiry\u016b}}, derived from '''Kikai ryu''' (Japanese for \"machine dragon\"). When a second Godzilla appears in 1999, the Japanese military create a Mechagodzilla codenamed Kiryu, built around the skeleton of the original Godzilla from 1954. During its first battle with Godzilla four years later in 2003, Kiryu's genetic memories of its 1954 incarnation are awakened, and it proceeds to attack Tokyo, free from the controls of its pilot until its power drains. During its second battle with Godzilla, Kiryu forces Godzilla to retreat after using its Absolute Zero Cannon.\n\nIn ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', taking place one year later in 2004, [[Mothra]]'s fairies warn Japan that Kiryu's creation is a violation of the natural order, and that Mothra would gladly take the cyborg's place in protecting Japan, should Kiryu be dismantled. The ultimatum is declined, as Kiryu was built partially to defend against a second attack from Mothra herself. Godzilla eventually appears, prompting Mothra and Kiryu to cooperate with each other. Kiryu momentarily is forced to fight Godzilla alone after Mothra is killed, but is later assisted by Mothra's larvae, who encase Godzilla in a cocoon, and Kiryu is given orders to terminate him. However, Kiryu's soul is awakened once again, and it instead submerges Godzilla and itself in the middle of the ocean (though not before ejecting its human occupant to safety).\n\n===Reiwa period (2017\u20132018)===\nMechagodzilla appears briefly in ''[[Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters]]'', the first film in the anime trilogy. The mecha is designed and constructed by Humans and Bilusaludo - the latter one of two alien races who made contact with humans in an attempt to rescue them - as a countermeasure against Godzilla. But the mech is never activated as Godzilla attacked the construction facility forcing them to abandon it. Though not seen again, the mech is referenced several other times throughout the film. In ''[[Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle]]'', the second film in the trilogy, the remnants of Mechagodzilla's AI rebuild the facility it was created in by utilizing nanometal to help defeat Godzilla, aptly named \"Mechagodzilla City\". It also creates three battlesuits with flight capabilities called \"''Vultures''\". Haruo and his forces use the city as a base of operations to destroy Godzilla. When Mechagodzilla City begins assimilating its surroundings and living beings with its nanometal under the command of the Bilusaludo, and is predicted to assimilate the entire planet prompting Haruo to destroy its command center, giving Godzilla the opening to destroy it. In ''[[Godzilla: The Planet Eater]]'', some nanometal survives within Yuko's body which Professor Martin extracts and applies to the last ''Vulture'' intending to rebuild civilization. Realizing this will only repeat the mistakes that prompted Godzilla's advent, endanger the Houtua and risk the return of Mechagodzilla and Ghidorah, Harou takes Yuko and the last Vulture and flies all three towards Godzilla in a suicide charge to save the Houtua from mankind's mistakes.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Films===\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' (2002) \n* ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (2003) \n* ''[[Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle]]'' (2018)\n\n===Television===\n* ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' (1997\u20131998)\n\n===Video games===\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] \u2013 1988) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Godzilla (Game Boy)|Godzilla]]'' / ''Godzilla-Kun: Kaijuu Daikessen'' ([[Game Boy]] \u2013 1990) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Battle Soccer: Field no Hasha]]'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] \u2013 1992) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] \u2013 1993) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mechagodzilla 2\n* ''[[Kaij\u016b-\u014d Godzilla]]'' / ''King of the Monsters, Godzilla'' ([[Game Boy]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Battle Legends]]'' ([[Turbo Duo]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster War]]'' / ''Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] \u2013 1994)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Giant Monster March|Godzilla Giant Monster March]]'' ([[Game Gear]] \u2013 1995)\n* ''[[Godzilla Trading Battle]]'' ([[PlayStation]] \u2013 1998) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mechagodzilla 2\n* ''[[Godzilla Generations]]'' ([[Dreamcast]] \u2013 1998) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' ([[Nintendo GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] \u2013 2002/2003) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla 2 and Mechagodzilla 3 (Xbox exclusive)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee|Godzilla: Domination!]]'' ([[Game Boy Advance]] \u2013 2002) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla 2 and Mechagodzilla 3\n* ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' ([[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]] \u2013 2004) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla 2 and Mechagodzilla 3\n* ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' ([[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]] \u2013 2007) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974, Wii exclusive), Mechagodzilla 2 and Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla Unleashed: Double Smash]]'' ([[Nintendo DS]] \u2013 2007) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''Godzilla on Monster Island'' (AVP Slot \u2013 2011) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'' ([[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]] \u2013 2014/2015) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974), Mechagodzilla 2 (1975, PS4 exclusive), Super Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu\n* ''[[City Shrouded in Shadow]]'' ([[PS4]] \u2013 2017) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''Godzilla Defense Force'' (2019)\n\n===Literature===\n* ''[[Ready Player One]]'' (novel - 2011) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters]]'' (comic - 2011-2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Gangsters and Goliaths]]'' (comic - 2011)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Legends]]'' (comic - 2011-2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Ongoing]]'' (comic - 2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: The Half-Century War]]'' (comic - 2012-2013)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Rulers of Earth]]'' (comic - 2013-2015) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974) and Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Oblivion]]'' (comic - 2016)\n* ''Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse'' (novel - 2017)\n* ''Godzilla: Project Mechagodzilla'' (novel - 2018)\n\n===Other appearances===\n{{Very long|section|small=left|date=July 2019}}\nThe various incarnations of Mechagodzilla have appeared in other media associated with the series, such as video games, television shows and comics. In the 5th-season episode of ''[[30 Rock (season 5)|30 Rock]]'', \"Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish\", Kiryu appears as one of the characters in a theme restaurant.\n\nIn [[Ernest Cline]]'s novel ''[[Ready Player One]]'' and its [[Ready Player One (film)|film adaptation]], the main antagonist Nolan Sorrento controls a full-size Mechagodzilla replica during the climatic battle in a virtual reality environment. In the book, it is the Kiryu model that fights against [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]]. The film version is an original design based on [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Legendary's Godzilla]] design that battles the [[The Iron Giant|Iron Giant]] and the [[Gundam (fictional robot)|RX-78-2 Gundam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/ranking-ready-player-one-easter-eggs-by-cleverness|title=The most (and least) clever Ready Player One Easter eggs and nostalgia references|first=Preston|last=Burt|work=Syfy|date=March 30, 2018|accessdate=October 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the game ''[[Bulletstorm]]'' there's a level where the player controls a mechanical version of a Hekaton (which is the game's equivalent to Godzilla) as well as the song being played during this part of the game being called \"Mecha-dzilla.\"\n\nGodzilla and Mechagodzilla make a cameo appearance in the ''[[Ugly Americans (TV series)|Ugly Americans]]'' episode \"Kong of Queens\" in which King Kong fights Godzilla (King Kong's children watching the movie ''Godzilla vs. King Kong'') and another when Kong punches a wall (after an argument with Mark Lily on the phone), the Showa-era Mechagodzilla was seen having breakfast.\n\nMechagodzilla was parodied by the series ''[[South Park]]'' in their episode \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\", which features singer [[Barbra Streisand]] becoming a gigantic mechanical monster. The episode also includes references to [[Mothra]], [[Gamera]], and Ultraman.\n\nThe Sh\u014dwa Mechagodzilla appears in the video games ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Godzilla (Game Boy)|Godzilla]]'' for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (American release; replaces the Heisei version from the Super Famicom release, since the Heisei incarnation's film had yet to be released in America when the game was released), ''[[Godzilla: Battle Legends]]'' for [[TurboGrafx-16]], ''[[Godzilla Generations]]'' for the [[Dreamcast]] (erroneously using his Heisei counterpart's sound effects) and ''[[Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact]]'' for the Dreamcast and the [[Wii]] version of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]''.\n\nThe Heisei Mechagodzilla appeared in the video games ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' (Japanese version, replaced by the Showa Mechagodzilla in the English release) and ''[[Godzilla: Monster War]]'', both for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''[[Godzilla: Domination|Godzilla: Domination!]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]], ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' for Xbox and the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]''.\n\nKiryu first appeared in the Japanese version of ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' on the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. Since the Millennium Mechagodzilla duology would take a few years to reach US stores, it was dropped from the American version of the game but did appear as an exclusive in the Xbox version. Kiryu was next playable in ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and the [[PlayStation 2]] under the title \"Mechagodzilla 3\"; this would be Kiryu's first PS2 appearance in the United States. Kiryu also appears in both versions of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'', for the first time under the name \"Kiryu\" as opposed to its names in the two previous games; \"Millennium Mechagodzilla\" and \"Mechagodzilla 3\".\n\nLike the other kaiju in the game, the backstories of all three Mechagodzilla incarnations are altered slightly, to fit the context of the game. The Heisei Mechagodzilla and Kiryu are man-made mecha created by the G.D.F. (Global Defense Force) faction to defend Earth from the Vortaak and their kaiju of the Aliens faction. The original Showa Mechagodzilla was salvaged and rebuilt by the Vortaak to be used in their kaiju force.\n\nIn the PlayStation 4 version of ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'', 4 incarnations of Mechagodzilla appear, the original Showa Mechagodzilla appears as both Mechagodzilla from ''Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla'' and as Mechagodzilla 2 the rebuilt Mechagodzilla from ''Terror of Mechagodzilla''. The Heisei Mechagodzilla appears in its Super Mechagodzilla form, while Kiryu appears in its rebuilt design from ''Tokyo S.O.S.'' In the PS4 version, all 4 Mechagodzilla are playable, the 2 versions of the Showa Mechagodzilla can be played in God of Destruction Mode via the Invade option (which allows the mode to be played using Kaiju other than the Heisei era Godzilla), while Super Mechagodzilla and Kiryu can be played via selecting Defend option (where the player defends humanity as friendly kaiju such as Mothra and various G-Force Mecha). In the PS3 version, only Mechagodzilla 1975, Super Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu appear as bosses and are not playable.\n\nThe thirteenth level of ''[[City Shrouded in Shadow]]'', a game where players, as civilians, must escape and survive kaiju attacks, mostly mirrors the first encounter between Godzilla and Kiryu in [[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]. The protagonists, tied up in the building by Yakuza thugs, witness [[Godzilla]] rampage through the game's setting, the fictional Ichi City, and Kiryu is eventually deployed in response. After a short battle where both shoot at each other, Godzilla roars at Kiryu, and reminds the spirit within of [[Godzilla (1954 film)|his past]] as a Godzilla, causing him to be possessed & go berserk. As Godzilla leaves, Kiryu approaches and fires missiles at the building in which the player is in. Once the player has reached safety or once 30 seconds have transpired, Kiryu marches through the building, cleaving it in half, heading off into the distance. The newspaper that displays the results after the level reveals that, after 30 minutes of rampaging, Kiryu has run out of power, allowing the government to retrieve the inactive mecha.\n\nWhile Mechagodzilla did not appear in ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'', a sequel to ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998), the first Godzilla was reanimated as a cyborg called ''Cyber-Godzilla'' in the Monster Wars trilogy.<ref name=\"Ultimate Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/03/28/godzilla-the-series/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Godzilla: The Series|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|last2=Aiken|first2=Keith|work=SciFi Japan|date=March 28, 2006|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character has generally been positively received.

In its debut appearance, Mechagodzilla is depicted as an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] villain that confronts [[Godzilla]]. In subsequent iterations, Mechagodzilla is usually depicted as a man-made weapon designed to defend [[Japan]] from Godzilla. In all incarnations, the character is portrayed as a robotic [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] with a vast array of weaponry, and along with [[King Ghidorah]], is commonly considered to be an archenemy of Godzilla.\n\n==Overview==\n===Development===\nMechagodzilla was conceived in 1974 as a more serious villain than its immediate two predecessors, [[Gigan]] and [[Megalon]], whose films were considered creative disasters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=195}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=196}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=197}} According to [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]], Mechagodzilla was inspired by both [[Mechani-Kong]] from the previous [[Toho]] film ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' and the [[Mecha anime and manga|robot anime]] genre, which was popular at the time.<ref name=\"\u5143\u5c71\u638c\">{{cite book |authors=\u5143\u5c71\u638c\u3001\u677e\u91ce\u672c\u548c\u5f18\u3001\u6d45\u4e95\u548c\u5eb7\u3001\u9234\u6728\u5ba3\u5b5d  |script-title=ja:\u300e\u6771\u5b9d\u7279\u64ae\u6620\u753b\u5927\u5168\u96c6\u300f \u30f4\u30a3\u30ec\u30c3\u30b8\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 |year=2012 |isbn=9784864910132}}</ref> Effects director [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] also felt that a mechanical monster was cheaper to construct than the mutated animals Godzilla had previously faced.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=137}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=138}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=139}} As the resulting ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' proved to be a greater critical success than previous 1970s ''Godzilla'' films, the character was revived in 1975's ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. The film's screenplay was based on the winning entry of a story-writing competition won by Yukiko Takayama, who continued the darker tone of the previous film by adding the subplot of Mechagodzilla being cybernetically connected to a young woman. Mechagodzilla's design remained largely unchanged from its previous appearance, though it was made to look thinner and more angular, with a darker sheen and an MG2 insignia emblazoned on its upper arms. The film's original draft was going to have Mechagodzilla destroy Tokyo utterly, though the destruction was cut down for budgetary reasons.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=200-6}}\n[[File:Heisei Godzilla Perfection - Berserk.jpg|thumb|right|Early concept art of Mechagodzilla's Heisei incarnation, dubbed \"Berserk\"]]\n\nMechagodzilla was brought back in 1993's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'', as the success of ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' and the popularity of its main antagonist [[Mothra]] spurred Toho into reintroducing familiar characters rather than inventing new ones.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=287-93}} Originally, the new Mechagodzilla was to be named \"Berserk\", and was envisioned as being a much more organic Godzilla-like creature which would later turn on its creators after becoming infected with a [[computer virus]] which makes it self-aware.

Special effects artist [[Koichi Kawakita]] originally envisioned Mechagodzilla being able to split into aerial and terrestrial units, though this idea was scrapped in favor of the character merging with the flying battleship Garuda.

This incarnation of Mechagodzilla was deliberately shown being airlifted by carriers rather than flying directly into battle as the previous two incarnations had done, as Tezuka felt that it made little sense for Mechagodzilla to drain its energy in such a manner. Upon being asked why the Mechagodzilla suit wasn't painted with [[military camouflage]] colors, Tezuka answered that \"Mechagodzilla doesn't need to hide.\"<ref>[http://www.henshinonline.com/tezuka-mimura.html \"Interview: Masaaki Tezuka and Wataru Mimura\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701043428/http://www.henshinonline.com/tezuka-mimura.html |date=2016-07-01 }}, ''henshionline'' (accessed 2016-26-05)</ref> Tezuka had originally intended to have both Godzilla and Mechagodzilla die at the end of the film, but was forced to change this on the insistence of Toho managers, who felt that such an ending was too dark for a [[New Year]] movie release.<ref name=\"tezuka2014\"/>\n\nIn the 2003 sequel ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', creature designer Shinichi Wakasa used the same mold to create a redesigned Mechagodzilla, which was meant to look more weathered than its predecessor. According to production designer Shinki Nishikawa, several other changes were made to the Mechagodzilla design's head, chest and arms in order to make the character look less heroic and more machine-like. The robot's back unit was reduced in size and flipped upside down, and the head was made smaller. As the previous design's shoulder cannons were considered uneven and unsophisticated-looking because of their rectangular shape, special effects director Eiichi Asada made them more pentagonal. As the character was supposed to rely more on its forearm cannons than in the previous film, Nishikawa made them larger and more powerful looking.<ref>\"Godzilla X Mothra X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo SOS production report - The men behind the monsters discuss the latest Godzilla film\", ''Uchusen'' #108 (Asahi Sonorama) (October 22, 2003)</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\n[[File:Mechagodzilla Absolute Zero.png|thumb|The Millennium Mechagodzilla's Absolute Zero Cannon featured in ''Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla'' (2002)]]\nThe Showa Mechagodzilla stands {{convert|50|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} in height and weighs 40,000 metric tons.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=196}} It is built from \"space [[titanium]]\", and is capable of launching missiles from its fingers, toes and knees, as well as firing energy beams from its eyes and chest unit.

First appearing in a pseudo-flesh outer covering and masquerading as the real Godzilla, Mechagodzilla attacks Japan and overpowers Godzilla's ally [[Anguirus]]. Godzilla appears and destroys the pseudo-flesh disguise, forcing Mechagodzilla to reveal itself in full. Their initial battle results in a tie, as Godzilla is severely wounded and Mechagodzilla is forced back into the Simian's base for repair. Mechagodzilla is deployed again but is overpowered through the combined efforts of Godzilla and [[King Caesar]]. Godzilla ultimately defeats Mechagodzilla by decapitating it and blowing its body apart.\n\nThe Simians return and rebuild Mechagodzilla in ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. This time, it is further modified with living human brain cells and has its control circuitry integrated into the body of the human woman Katsura Mafune, who is a [[cyborg]] courtesy of the aliens. Mechagodzilla is teamed up with the dinosaur [[Titanosaurus (Godzilla)|Titanosaurus]], who is controlled by Katsura's crazed father. Although Mechagodzilla survives another decapitation during a battle against Godzilla, it is once more defeated after Katsura commits suicide, destroying the robot's controls and freezing it long enough for Godzilla to use its atomic heat ray on Mechagodzilla's headless body, causing it to explode.\n[[File:Heisei Mechagodzilla.png|thumb|Heisei Mechagodzilla]]\n\n===Heisei period (1993)===\nIn ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'', Mechagodzilla is built as an anti-Godzilla weapon by the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center using 23rd century technology [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the remains of [[King Ghidorah|Mecha-King Ghidorah]]. Mechagodzilla overpowers Godzilla in Kyoto, but is rendered harmless by a voltage backsurge caused by Godzilla. Mechagodzilla is recovered and merged with the smaller airship Garuda to form {{nihongo|'''Super-Mechagodzilla'''|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30e1\u30ab\u30b4\u30b8\u30e9|Supa-Mekagojira}}. This combined mecha later fights both [[Rodan|Fire Rodan]] and Godzilla. It proceeds to cripple Godzilla by destroying its secondary brain and mortally wounds Rodan. Rodan then sacrifices its energy to revive Godzilla, who then uses its new red spiral atomic breath to destroy the weakened Super-Mechagodzilla.\n\nIn ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', it is revealed that Mechagodzilla's remains were salvaged and used to construct [[Moguera]].\n[[File:Millennium Mechagodzilla.png|thumb|Millennium Mechagodzilla]]\n\n===Millennium period (2002\u20132003)===\nThe Millennium incarnation is featured in two films: ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' and is referenced as {{nihongo|'''Kiryu'''|\u6a5f\u9f8d|Kiry\u016b}}, derived from '''Kikai ryu''' (Japanese for \"machine dragon\"). When a second Godzilla appears in 1999, the Japanese military create a Mechagodzilla codenamed Kiryu, built around the skeleton of the original Godzilla from 1954. During its first battle with Godzilla four years later in 2003, Kiryu's genetic memories of its 1954 incarnation are awakened, and it proceeds to attack Tokyo, free from the controls of its pilot until its power drains. During its second battle with Godzilla, Kiryu forces Godzilla to retreat after using its Absolute Zero Cannon.\n\nIn ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', taking place one year later in 2004, [[Mothra]]'s fairies warn Japan that Kiryu's creation is a violation of the natural order, and that Mothra would gladly take the cyborg's place in protecting Japan, should Kiryu be dismantled. The ultimatum is declined, as Kiryu was built partially to defend against a second attack from Mothra herself. Godzilla eventually appears, prompting Mothra and Kiryu to cooperate with each other. Kiryu momentarily is forced to fight Godzilla alone after Mothra is killed, but is later assisted by Mothra's larvae, who encase Godzilla in a cocoon, and Kiryu is given orders to terminate him. However, Kiryu's soul is awakened once again, and it instead submerges Godzilla and itself in the middle of the ocean (though not before ejecting its human occupant to safety).\n\n===Reiwa period (2017\u20132018)===\nMechagodzilla appears briefly in ''[[Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters]]'', the first film in the anime trilogy. The mecha is designed and constructed by Humans and Bilusaludo - the latter one of two alien races who made contact with humans in an attempt to rescue them - as a countermeasure against Godzilla. But the mech is never activated as Godzilla attacked the construction facility forcing them to abandon it. Though not seen again, the mech is referenced several other times throughout the film. In ''[[Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle]]'', the second film in the trilogy, the remnants of Mechagodzilla's AI rebuild the facility it was created in by utilizing nanometal to help defeat Godzilla, aptly named \"Mechagodzilla City\". It also creates three battlesuits with flight capabilities called \"''Vultures''\". Haruo and his forces use the city as a base of operations to destroy Godzilla. When Mechagodzilla City begins assimilating its surroundings and living beings with its nanometal under the command of the Bilusaludo, and is predicted to assimilate the entire planet prompting Haruo to destroy its command center, giving Godzilla the opening to destroy it. In ''[[Godzilla: The Planet Eater]]'', some nanometal survives within Yuko's body which Professor Martin extracts and applies to the last ''Vulture'' intending to rebuild civilization. Realizing this will only repeat the mistakes that prompted Godzilla's advent, endanger the Houtua and risk the return of Mechagodzilla and Ghidorah, Harou takes Yuko and the last Vulture and flies all three towards Godzilla in a suicide charge to save the Houtua from mankind's mistakes.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Films===\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' (1974)\n* ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' (2002) \n* ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (2003) \n* ''[[Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle]]'' (2018)\n\n===Television===\n* ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' (1997\u20131998)\n\n===Video games===\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] \u2013 1988) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Godzilla (Game Boy)|Godzilla]]'' / ''Godzilla-Kun: Kaijuu Daikessen'' ([[Game Boy]] \u2013 1990) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Battle Soccer: Field no Hasha]]'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] \u2013 1992) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] \u2013 1993) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mechagodzilla 2\n* ''[[Kaij\u016b-\u014d Godzilla]]'' / ''King of the Monsters, Godzilla'' ([[Game Boy]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Battle Legends]]'' ([[Turbo Duo]] \u2013 1993)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster War]]'' / ''Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] \u2013 1994)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Giant Monster March|Godzilla Giant Monster March]]'' ([[Game Gear]] \u2013 1995)\n* ''[[Godzilla Trading Battle]]'' ([[PlayStation]] \u2013 1998) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mechagodzilla 2\n* ''[[Godzilla Generations]]'' ([[Dreamcast]] \u2013 1998) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' ([[Nintendo GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] \u2013 2002/2003) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla 2 and Mechagodzilla 3 (Xbox exclusive)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee|Godzilla: Domination!]]'' ([[Game Boy Advance]] \u2013 2002) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla 2 and Mechagodzilla 3\n* ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' ([[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]] \u2013 2004) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla 2 and Mechagodzilla 3\n* ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' ([[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]] \u2013 2007) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974, Wii exclusive), Mechagodzilla 2 and Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla Unleashed: Double Smash]]'' ([[Nintendo DS]] \u2013 2007) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''Godzilla on Monster Island'' (AVP Slot \u2013 2011) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'' ([[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]] \u2013 2014/2015) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974), Mechagodzilla 2 (1975, PS4 exclusive), Super Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu\n* ''[[City Shrouded in Shadow]]'' ([[PS4]] \u2013 2017) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''Godzilla Defense Force'' (2019)\n\n===Literature===\n* ''[[Ready Player One]]'' (novel - 2011) \u2013 as Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters]]'' (comic - 2011-2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Gangsters and Goliaths]]'' (comic - 2011)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Legends]]'' (comic - 2011-2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Ongoing]]'' (comic - 2012)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: The Half-Century War]]'' (comic - 2012-2013)\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Rulers of Earth]]'' (comic - 2013-2015) \u2013 as Mechagodzilla (1974) and Kiryu\n* ''[[Godzilla (comics)#IDW Publishing|Godzilla: Oblivion]]'' (comic - 2016)\n* ''Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse'' (novel - 2017)\n* ''Godzilla: Project Mechagodzilla'' (novel - 2018)\n\n===Other appearances===\n{{Very long|section|small=left|date=July 2019}}\nThe various incarnations of Mechagodzilla have appeared in other media associated with the series, such as video games, television shows and comics.

In the book, it is the Kiryu model that fights against [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]].

The episode also includes references to [[Mothra]], [[Gamera]], and Ultraman.\n\nThe Sh\u014dwa Mechagodzilla appears in the video games ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Godzilla (Game Boy)|Godzilla]]'' for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (American release; replaces the Heisei version from the Super Famicom release, since the Heisei incarnation's film had yet to be released in America when the game was released), ''[[Godzilla: Battle Legends]]'' for [[TurboGrafx-16]], ''[[Godzilla Generations]]'' for the [[Dreamcast]] (erroneously using his Heisei counterpart's sound effects) and ''[[Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact]]'' for the Dreamcast and the [[Wii]] version of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]''.\n\nThe Heisei Mechagodzilla appeared in the video games ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' (Japanese version, replaced by the Showa Mechagodzilla in the English release) and ''[[Godzilla: Monster War]]'', both for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''[[Godzilla: Domination|Godzilla: Domination!]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]], ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' for Xbox and the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]''.\n\nKiryu first appeared in the Japanese version of ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' on the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. Since the Millennium Mechagodzilla duology would take a few years to reach US stores, it was dropped from the American version of the game but did appear as an exclusive in the Xbox version. Kiryu was next playable in ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and the [[PlayStation 2]] under the title \"Mechagodzilla 3\"; this would be Kiryu's first PS2 appearance in the United States. Kiryu also appears in both versions of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'', for the first time under the name \"Kiryu\" as opposed to its names in the two previous games; \"Millennium Mechagodzilla\" and \"Mechagodzilla 3\".\n\nLike the other kaiju in the game, the backstories of all three Mechagodzilla incarnations are altered slightly, to fit the context of the game. The Heisei Mechagodzilla and Kiryu are man-made mecha created by the G.D.F. (Global Defense Force) faction to defend Earth from the Vortaak and their kaiju of the Aliens faction. The original Showa Mechagodzilla was salvaged and rebuilt by the Vortaak to be used in their kaiju force.\n\nIn the PlayStation 4 version of ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'', 4 incarnations of Mechagodzilla appear, the original Showa Mechagodzilla appears as both Mechagodzilla from ''Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla'' and as Mechagodzilla 2 the rebuilt Mechagodzilla from ''Terror of Mechagodzilla''. The Heisei Mechagodzilla appears in its Super Mechagodzilla form, while Kiryu appears in its rebuilt design from ''Tokyo S.O.S.'' In the PS4 version, all 4 Mechagodzilla are playable, the 2 versions of the Showa Mechagodzilla can be played in God of Destruction Mode via the Invade option (which allows the mode to be played using Kaiju other than the Heisei era Godzilla), while Super Mechagodzilla and Kiryu can be played via selecting Defend option (where the player defends humanity as friendly kaiju such as Mothra and various G-Force Mecha). In the PS3 version, only Mechagodzilla 1975, Super Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu appear as bosses and are not playable.\n\nThe thirteenth level of ''[[City Shrouded in Shadow]]'', a game where players, as civilians, must escape and survive kaiju attacks, mostly mirrors the first encounter between Godzilla and Kiryu in [[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]. The protagonists, tied up in the building by Yakuza thugs, witness [[Godzilla]] rampage through the game's setting, the fictional Ichi City, and Kiryu is eventually deployed in response. After a short battle where both shoot at each other, Godzilla roars at Kiryu, and reminds the spirit within of [[Godzilla (1954 film)|his past]] as a Godzilla, causing him to be possessed & go berserk. As Godzilla leaves, Kiryu approaches and fires missiles at the building in which the player is in. Once the player has reached safety or once 30 seconds have transpired, Kiryu marches through the building, cleaving it in half, heading off into the distance. The newspaper that displays the results after the level reveals that, after 30 minutes of rampaging, Kiryu has run out of power, allowing the government to retrieve the inactive mecha.\n\nWhile Mechagodzilla did not appear in ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'', a sequel to ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998), the first Godzilla was reanimated as a cyborg called ''Cyber-Godzilla'' in the Monster Wars trilogy.<ref name=\"Ultimate Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/03/28/godzilla-the-series/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Godzilla: The Series|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|last2=Aiken|first2=Keith|work=SciFi Japan|date=March 28, 2006|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character has generally been positively received.

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick\u2019s poetry is translated into many languages. In recent years it has become widely known in China. A selection of Mark\u2019s poems translated by Isabelle Li appeared in Famous Writing in World Literature, published by ZZHW (The Writers Publishing House), in November 2017. In November 2017 Mark was a guest of the Hong Kong International Poetry Nights (in Hong Kong and Hangzhou); in November 2018, he was a guest of the Xichang Silk Road International Poetry Festival; and\u00a0 in April 2019, he was a guest of the International Writers Program at the Lu Xun Academy in Beijing. In 2020, a selection of his essays appears in Chinese; in 2021, a selection of his poems.\n\nIn July 2012, Mark was a guest of the Oxford Literature Festival; in September 2018, the Berlin International Literature Festival\n\nSir Andrew Motion has written of Mark Tredinnick: \u201chis is a bold, big-thinking poetry, in which ancient themes (especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape) are recast and rekindled.\u201d \n\nHe is at work on a memoir of the reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time. His next Australian collection of poems, Walking Underwater, will appear in 2020; another collection, A Beginner\u2019s Guide, early in 2020. Two other collections will follow soon after, along with an illustrated book of haiku, A Hundred Miles from Home: One Hundred Haiku. \n\nRecent accomplishments\n\n* Mark was Writer in Residence at the University of Sydney 2018\n* \u201cTime Passages,\u201d a poem commissioned by Alan Holley for his piece of the same name for the Australian Chamber Choir, premiered in Middle Park Melbourne (June 2019), ahead of the choir\u2019s 2019 European tour\n* \u201cShorelines,\u201d a collaboration with sculptor and painter Michael Henderson showed in Hobart for the centenary of Armistice (2018)\n* \u201cCatchments,\u201d a poem commissioned for the retiring chair of Red Room Poetry (2019)\n* \u201cLitany,\u201d a poem commissioned for Red Room\u2019s Ecological Elegies project (2019)\n* \u201cNourishing Terrains,\u201d an essay on belonging (Sydney Review of Books, September 2018)\n* \u201cThe Temple of the Word,\u201d an essay on poetry, place, and mental health for the book Hearth (Milkweed, St Paul, 2018)\n* the inclusion of his poem \u201cInland\u201d in the anthology Here: Poems for the Planet (ed.

He teaches rhetoric, poetry, journalism and literature at the University of Sydney and the University of Technology, Sydney. He lives and writes at Bowral, southwest of Sydney, with his partner Jodie Williams. \n\n\n\u201cLike the singing of the birds he loves,\u201d Jean Kent has said, \u201cMark Tredinnick's poetry feels artlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind.

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n'''Books'''\n\nWestern Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize'''\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d        \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

He led the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] during that time, having previously been a long-serving government minister.\n\nGorton was born out of wedlock and had a turbulent childhood. He studied at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], after finishing his secondary education at [[Geelong Grammar School]], and then returned to Australia to take over his father's property in northern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Gorton enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1940, and served as a fighter pilot in [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]] and [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] during the Second World War. He suffered severe facial injuries in a crash landing on [[Bintan Island]] in 1942, and whilst being evacuated; his ship was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. He returned to farming after being discharged in 1944, and was elected to the [[Shire of Kerang|Kerang Shire Council]] in 1946; he later served a term as shire president.\n\nAfter a previous unsuccessful candidacy at state level, Gorton was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] at the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 federal election]]. He took a keen interest in foreign policy, and gained a reputation as a strident [[anti-Communist]]. Gorton was promoted to the ministry in 1958, and over the following decade held a variety of different portfolios in the governments of [[Robert Menzies]] and [[Harold Holt]]. He was responsible at various times for the Navy, public works, education, and science. He was elevated to the Cabinet in 1966, and the following year, he was promoted to [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Australia)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]].\n\nGorton [[1968 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|defeated]] three other candidates for the Liberal leadership after [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|Harold Holt's disappearance]] on 17 December 1967. He became the first and only senator to assume the office of Prime Minister, but soon transferred to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in line with constitutional convention. The [[Gorton Government]] continued [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australian involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], but began withdrawing troops amid growing public discontent. It retained office at the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 federal election]], albeit with a severely reduced majority. Gorton's domestic policies, which emphasised [[centralisation]] and [[economic nationalism]], were often controversial in his own party, and his individualistic style alienated many of his Cabinet members. He resigned as Liberal leader in 1971 after a [[confidence motion]] in his leadership was tied, and was replaced by [[William McMahon]].\n\nAfter losing the premiership, Gorton was elected deputy leader under McMahon and appointed [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]]. He was sacked for disloyalty after a few months. After the Coalition's defeat at the [[1972 Australian federal election|1972 federal election]], Gorton [[1972 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|unsuccessfully stood]] as McMahon's replacement. He briefly served as an opposition [[frontbencher]] under [[Billy Snedden]], but stood down in 1974 and spent the rest of his career as a [[backbencher]]. Gorton resigned from the Liberal Party when [[Malcolm Fraser]] was elected leader, and at the [[1975 Australian federal election|1975 election]] mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate as an [[Independent politician|independent]]. He later spent several years as a political commentator, retiring from public life in 1981.\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth and family background===\n[[File:JohnGorton1913.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton as a toddler in 1913]]\n[[File:NlaGortonmotherAlice1915.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton as a child and his mother Alice in 1915]]\nJohn Grey Gorton was the second child of Alice Sinn and John Rose Gorton; his older sister Ruth was born in 1909. He had no birth certificate, but on official forms recorded his date of birth as 9 September 1911 and his place of birth as [[Wellington]], New Zealand. His birth was registered in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as occurring on that date, but in the inner [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. However, that document contained a number of inaccuracies \u2013 his name was given as \"John Alga Gordon\", his parents were recorded as husband and wife, his father's name was incorrect, and his sister was recorded as deceased.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Hancock|title=John Gorton: He Did It His Way|publisher=Hodder|year=2002|page=1|isbn=0733614396}}</ref> At some point, Gorton's father told him that he had actually been born in Wellington. There are no records of his birth in New Zealand, but his parents are known to have travelled there on several occasions.<ref name=p2>Hancock (2002), p. 2.</ref> John Gorton apparently believed he was born in Wellington, listing the city as his place of birth on his RAAF enlistment papers.<ref>[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/before-office.aspx Before office - John Gorton], National Archives of Australia. Retrieved 6 November 2019.</ref> \n\nIf John Gorton was indeed born in New Zealand, this would have made him a New Zealand citizen from 1 January 1949 under changes to [[New Zealand nationality law]]. Holding dual-citizenship would have rendered Gorton ineligible to sit in Australia's federal parliament under [[Section 44 of the Australian Constitution]]. Gorton's eligibility to have sat in parliament throughout his career is therefore unclear.<ref>[https://williamsummers.blog/2017/08/07/section-44-twist-former-aussie-pm-was-probably-ineligible-for-parliament-due-to-multiple-citizenship/ Section 44 twist: Former Aussie PM was probably ineligible due to multiple citizenship], William Summers (blog). Retrieved 6 November 2019.</ref>\n\nGorton's father was born to a middle-class family in [[Manchester]], [[England]], UK. As a young man he moved to [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, where he went into business as a merchant \u2013 during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], he developed a reputation as a [[War profiteering|war profiteer]]. He reputedly escaped the [[Siege of Ladysmith]] by sneaking through Boer lines, and then made his way to Australia.<ref name=p3>Hancock (2002), p. 3.</ref> He was involved in various business schemes in multiple states, and was to said to have \"lived on the brink of a fortune which never quite materialised\".<ref name=p4>Hancock (2002), p. 4.</ref> One of his business partners was the inventor [[George Julius]].<ref name=p3/> At some point, Gorton's father separated from his first wife, Kathleen O'Brien, and began living with Alice Sinn \u2013 born in Melbourne to a German father and an Irish mother.<ref name=p2/> However, Kathleen refused to grant him a divorce. Some official documents record Gorton's parents as having married in New Zealand at some point, but there are no records of this occurring; any such marriage would have been bigamous. Gorton never denied his illegitimacy as an adult, but it did not become generally known until a biography was published during his premiership.<ref name=p4/>\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:JohnGorton1930.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton as a student at Geelong Grammar School in 1930; he is seated to the left]]\nGorton spent his early years living with his maternal grandparents in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]], as his parents were frequently away on business trips. When he was about four years old, his parents took him to live with them in Sydney, where they had an apartment at [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]]. Gorton began his education at Edgecliff Preparatory School.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 5.</ref> When he was eight years old, his mother contracted tuberculosis and was sent to a [[sanatorium]] to avoid passing on the disease. She died in September 1920, aged 32. Gorton's grieving father sent his son to live with his estranged wife Kathleen. There, he met his sister Ruth for the first time; he had previously been told that she was dead. Although she was his full sibling, she had been raised by Kathleen since birth, and rarely saw her biological parents. Gorton initially lived with Kathleen and Ruth at their home in [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]]. They later moved into a larger house in [[Killara, New South Wales|Killara]], in the north of Sydney.<ref name=hp8>Hancock (2002), p. 8.</ref>\n\nWhile living in Killara, Gorton began attending Headfort College, a short-lived private school run by a former Anglican minister.<ref name=hp8/> In 1924, he began boarding at [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]] (Shore), initially on a weekly basis but later on a full-time one.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 9.</ref> He did not excel academically, failing the [[Intermediate Certificate (Australia)|Intermediate Certificate]] on his first attempt, but was a well-liked boy and good at sports.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 10.</ref> Gorton began spending his holidays with his father, who had purchased a property in [[Mystic Park, Victoria]], and planted a citrus orchard.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 11.</ref> He left Shore at the end of 1926, and the following year began boarding at [[Geelong Grammar School]], which he would attend for four years from 1927\u201330.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 12.</ref> He represented the school in athletics, [[Australian rules football|football]], and rowing, and in his final year was a school prefect and house captain.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 15.</ref>\n\n===University===\nAfter leaving Geelong Grammar, Gorton spent a year working on his father's property in Mystic Park. His father then took out a second mortgage to allow him to travel to England and attend [[Oxford University]]. Gorton arrived in England in early-1932, and after a period at a \"cramming school\" passed the exam to enter [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]]. He also took flying lessons around the same time, and was awarded a pilot's licence in June 1932. Gorton began his degree in October 1932 and finished in June 1935 with an \"[[Upper-second class|upper second]]\" in History, Politics, and Economics. He was initially something of an outsider, with relatively little money and no social connections. However, his prowess in rowing \u2013 he won the O.U.B.C. Fours in his first year, and was Captain of the [[Brasenose College Boat Club]] \u2013 saw him elected to [[Vincent's Club]] and [[Leander Club]]. In 1934, while on holiday in [[Second Spanish Republic|Spain]], he met his future wife [[Bettina Gorton|Bettina Brown]], the younger sister of one of his College friends. They married in early 1935.<ref name=bdas>[http://biography.senate.gov.au/gorton-john-grey GORTON, SIR JOHN GREY (1911\u20132002)], Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate (Online Edition). Retrieved 12 March 2018.</ref>\n\n===Return to Australia===\nAfter his graduation, Gorton and his wife returned to Australia via the [[United States]], spending some time with her family in [[Maine]]. He had expected to take up a position at [[The Herald and Weekly Times]], [[Keith Murdoch]]'s newspaper group. However, he arrived in Melbourne to find his father in failing health; he died in August 1936. Gorton had taken over the management of his father's orchard as soon as he entered hospital. He inherited an overdraft of \u00a35,000, which took several years to pay off. However, the property \u2013 located on the western side of [[North Victorian Wetlands|Kangaroo Lake]] \u2013 was in good condition, requiring only minor improvements. He employed up to ten seasonal workers during picking season. Mystic Park remained his primary residence until he was appointed to the ministry, at which point he and his family moved to Canberra.<ref name=bdas/>\n\n==Military service==\n\n===1940\u20131942===\n[[File:JohnGortonWW21941.jpg|thumb|left|Pilot Officer Gorton]]\n[[File:JohnGorton1941.jpg|thumb|right|Gorton prior to leaving for war service in 1941]]\nOn 31 May 1940, following the outbreak of World War II, Gorton enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] Reserve.<ref>Hancock: 30</ref> At the age of 29, Gorton was considered too old for pilot training, but he re-applied in September after this rule was relaxed. Gorton was accepted and commissioned into the RAAF on 8 November 1940.<ref>Hancock: 31</ref> He trained as a fighter pilot at [[Somers, Victoria]] and [[Wagga Wagga]], [[New South Wales]], before being sent to the UK. Gorton completed his training at [[RAF Heston]] and [[RAF Honiley]],<ref name=\"Trengrove: 71\">Trengrove: 71</ref> with [[No. 61 Operational Training Unit RAF]], flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s.<ref name=\"Hancock: 33\">Hancock: 33</ref> He was disappointed when his first operational posting was [[No. 135 Squadron RAF]], a [[Hawker Hurricane]] unit, as he considered the type greatly inferior to Spitfires.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 71\"/>\n\nDuring late 1941, Gorton and other members of his squadron became part of the [[En cadre|cadre]] of a Hurricane [[wing (air force unit)|wing]] being formed for service in the Middle East. They were sent by sea, with 50 Hurricanes in crates, travelling around Africa to reduce the risk of attack. In December, when the ship was at [[Durban]], South Africa, it was diverted to Singapore, after [[Pacific War|Japan entered the war]].<ref>Trengrove: 72</ref> As it approached its destination in mid-January, [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces were [[Battle of Malaya|advancing down the Malayan Peninsula]]. The ship was attacked on at least one occasion by Japanese aircraft, but arrived and unloaded safely after tropical storms made enemy air raids impossible.<ref>Trengrove: 73\u201374</ref> As the Hurricanes were assembled, the pilots were formed into a composite operational squadron, [[No. 232 Squadron RAF]].\n\nIn late January 1942, the squadron became operational and joined the remnants of several others that had been in Malaya, operating out of [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]] and RAF [[Kallang]].<ref>Trengrove: 75</ref> During one of his first [[sortie]]s, Gorton was involved in a brief dogfight over the [[South China Sea]], after which he suffered engine failure and was forced to land on [[Bintan]] island,<ref name=\"Hancock: 33\"/> 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) south east of Singapore. As he landed, one of the Hurricane's wheels hit an embankment and flipped over. Gorton was not properly strapped in and his face hit the gun sight and windscreen, mutilating his nose and breaking both cheekbones.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 76\">Trengrove: 76</ref> He also suffered severe lacerations to both arms. He made his way out of the wreck and was rescued by members of the [[Royal Dutch East Indies Army]], who provided some medical treatment. Gorton later claimed that his face was so badly cut and bruised, that a member of the RAF sent to collect him assumed he was near death, collected his personal effects and returned to Singapore without him.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 76\"/> By chance, one week later, Sgt Matt O'Mara of [[No. 453 Squadron RAAF]] also crash landed on Bintan, and arranged for them to be collected.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 77\">Trengrove: 77</ref>\n\nThey arrived back in Singapore, on 11 February, three days after [[battle of Singapore|the island had been invaded]].<ref name=\"Trengrove: 77\"/> As the Allied air force units on Singapore had been destroyed or evacuated by this stage, Gorton was put on the ''Derrymore'', an ammunition ship bound for [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (Jakarta). On 13 February, as it neared its destination, the ship was torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-55 [[Kaidai class submarine]] and the ''Derrymore'' was abandoned. Gorton then spent almost a day on a crowded liferaft, in shark-infested waters, with little drinking water, until the raft was spotted by [[HMAS Ballarat (J184)|HMAS ''Ballarat'']], which picked up the passengers and took them to Batavia.<ref>Trengrove: 80</ref>\n\n[[File:77_Sqn_RAAF_pilots_%26_Kittyhawk_(AWM_NWA0019).JPG|thumb|left|Pilots of B Flight, No. 77 Squadron with a P-40 Kittyhawk in the Northern Territory, January 1943. Gorton is fourth left in the back row.]]\nTwo schoolfriends, who had also been evacuated from Singapore to Batavia, heard that Gorton was in hospital, arranged for them to be put on a ship for [[Fremantle]], which left on 23 February and treated Gorton's wounds.<ref>Trengrove: 81</ref> When the ship arrived in Fremantle, on 3 March, one of Gorton's arm wounds had become septic and needed extensive treatment. However, he was more concerned about the effect that the sight of his mutilated face would have on his wife. It is reported that Betty Gorton, who had been running the farm in his absence, was relieved to see Gorton alive.<ref name=\"Hancock: 33\"/><ref>Trengrove: 82</ref>\n\n===1942\u20131944===\n\nAfter arriving in Australia he was posted to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] on 12 August 1942 with [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF]] (Kittyhawks). During this time he was involved in his second air accident.  While flying [[P-40E]] A29-60 on 7 September 1942, he was forced to land due to an incorrectly set fuel cock. Both Gorton and his aircraft were recovered several days later after spending time in the bush. On 21 February 1943 the squadron was relocated to [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]].<ref name=naaws>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/before-office.aspx#section2 |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |title=John Gorton, Before office, War service 1940\u201345 | accessdate= 24 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nGorton's final air incident came on 18 March 1943. His A29-192 Kittyhawk's engine failed on takeoff, causing the aircraft to flip at the end of the strip. Gorton was unhurt. In March 1944, Gorton was sent back to Australia with the rank of Flight Lieutenant. His final posting was as a Flying Instructor with [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No. 2 Operational Training Unit]] at [[Mildura]], Victoria.  He was then discharged from the RAAF on 5 December 1944.<ref name=naaws/>\n\nDuring late 1944 Gorton went to [[Austin Hospital, Melbourne|Heidelberg Hospital]] for surgery which could not fully repair his facial injuries; he was left permanently disfigured.<ref name=naaws/>\n\n==Early political involvement==\nAfter resuming his life in Mystic Park, Gorton was elected unopposed to the [[Shire of Kerang|Kerang Shire Council]] in September 1946. He remained on the council until 1952, overlapping with his first term in the Senate, and from 1949 to 1950 served as shire president.<ref name=p46>Hancock (2002), p. 46.</ref> Although he had little previous experience, Gorton began to develop a reputation as a powerful public speaker. His first major speech, in April 1946, was an address to a welcome-home gathering for returned soldiers at the Mystic Park Hall. In what [[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]] has described as \"Australia's best unknown political speech\",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/when-heartfelt-oratory-gave-us-a-political-vision-to-believe-in/news-story/f6e976b88facb7aef45be610e8025547|title=When heartfelt oratory gave us a political vision to believe in|author=[[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]]|date=1 July 2016|access-date=21 September 2018|work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref> he exhorted his audience to honour those who had died in the war by building \"a world in which meanness and poverty, tyranny and hate, have no existence\". Gorton's next major speech was made in September 1947, at a rally against the [[Chifley Government]]'s attempt to nationalise private banks. He told the crowd in [[Kerang]] that they should oppose the establishment of banks run by politicians, and objected in particular to the government's decision not to take the issue to a referendum.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 49.</ref> According to his biographer Ian Hancock, \"the bank nationalisation issue marked his advance beyond purely local politics and stamped him firmly and publicly as an anti-socialist\".<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 51.</ref>\n\nGorton had been a supporter of the [[Country Party (Victoria)|Country Party]] before the war, along with most of his neighbours. Over time, he became frustrated with the party's frequent squabbles with the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] and its willingness to cooperate with the [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor Party]].<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 52.</ref> After the Victorian Country Party withdrew from [[Coalition (Australia)|its coalition]] with the Liberals in December 1948, Gorton became involved in efforts to form a new anti-socialist movement that would absorb both parties. At some point he was introduced to [[Magnus Cormack]], the state president of the Liberals, who became something of a mentor.<ref name=p53>Hancock (2002), pp. 53\u201354.</ref> In March 1949, Gorton was elected to the state executive of the new organisation, which named itself the [[Liberal and Country Party]] (LCP).<ref name=p55>Hancock (2002), p. 55.</ref> On a number of occasions he addressed Country Party gatherings, urging its members to join the new party and stressing that it would not neglect rural interests, as many feared.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 56.</ref> However, the LCP did not achieve its goal of uniting the anti-Labor forces, as most Country Party members viewed it as simply a takeover attempt; the new party affiliated with the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia]].<ref name=p53/>\n\nIn June 1949, Gorton stood for the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] as the LCP candidate in [[Northern Province (Victoria)|Northern Province]]. It was a safe Country Party seat, and at the preceding three elections no other parties had bothered to field a candidate.<ref name=p55/> Making right-wing unity the focal point of his campaign, Gorton polled 48.8 percent of the vote to finish less than 400 votes behind the sitting member, [[George Tuckett (politician)|George Tuckett]]. The result impressed the LCP's leadership,<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 57.</ref> and the following month he was [[preselection|preselected]] in third place on its joint [[Australian Senate|Senate]] ticket with the Country Party. He was relatively unknown within the party, and his rural background was a major factor in his selection.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 58.</ref> The Coalition won a large majority at the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 federal election]], including four out of Victoria's seven senators.

Gorton's early speeches on domestic policy foreshadowed the stances and policy initiatives he would later adopt as prime minister, such as economic nationalism, support for a strong central government, and support for nuclear energy. One of his first notable actions in the Senate came in November 1951, when he successfully moved a motion opposing \"any substantial measure of ownership or control over any Australian broadcasting station\" being granted to non-Australians.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=73}} In his early speeches on foreign policy, Gorton drew analogies between the actions of the Soviet Union and Communist China and those of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=68}} He developed a reputation as a \"hardline [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]]\", speaking in favour of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill and campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote during the [[1951 Australian Communist Party ban referendum|1951 referendum]] to ban the [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=64\u201366}} At a campaign rally in September 1951, he had to be restrained by police after attempting to drag a heckler from his seat and shouting at him to \"come outside, you yellow rat\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/23077920|title=Women rush from hall|publisher=[[Melbourne Argus]]|date=5 September 1951}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1952 to 1958, Gorton served on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, including as chairman for a period. He developed a keen interest in Asia, which was rooted in his anti-communism, and joined parliamentary delegations to Malaya, South Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. He strongly supported Australia joining the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO), a collective defence initiative designed to [[domino theory|prevent the spread of communism]] in the region. He also supported [[Taiwanese independence]] and opposed Australian recognition of the People's Republic of China (PRC).{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=67}} On a number of occasions, Gorton spoke of the need for Australia to develop a foreign policy independent of Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=68}} In May 1957, he told the Senate that Australia should acquire its own nuclear deterrent, including intercontinental missiles.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=69}}\n\n===Government minister===\n====Navy====\n[[File:Paul Hasluck, Shen Chang-huan, John Gorton.jpg|thumb|right|Gorton in 1965 with External Affairs Minister [[Paul Hasluck]] and Taiwanese foreign minister [[Shen Chang-huan]]]]\nGorton was elevated to the ministry after the [[1958 Australian federal election|1958 election]], as [[Minister for the Navy (Australia)|Minister for the Navy]]. This was a junior position subordinate to the Minister for Defence, [[Athol Townley]]. Although his promotion was unexpected,{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=81}} he would serve as Minister for the Navy for more than five years, the longest-serving navy minister in Australia's history.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=96}} Gorton regularly attended meetings of the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Naval Board]], unlike previous ministers, and championed its recommendations at cabinet meetings. He was able to secure most elements of the board's desired modernisation program, despite Townley showing more interest in the air force. During Gorton's tenure, the navy acquired four Australian-built frigates and six British-built minesweepers, as well as placing orders for three [[Charles F. Adams-class destroyer|''Charles F. Adams''-class destroyer]]s and four [[Oberon-class submarine|''Oberon''-class submarine]]s. He postponed the phasing out of the [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]], due to occur in 1963, and secured the purchase of 27 [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=87\u201390}}\n\nGorton was a supporter and admirer of Robert Menzies, who was sympathetic to his ambitions for higher office and assigned him additional responsibilities. In 1959, he was tasked with securing the passage of the Matrimonial Causes Bill, which introduced uniform divorce laws; he described it as \"a systematic attempt to make a new approach to the problem of divorce\". The bill was opposed by religious conservatives (mostly Catholics) on both sides of politics, but it eventually passed the Senate with only a single amendment.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=85\u201386}} Gorton was appointed assistant minister to the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for External Affairs]] in February 1960, working under Menzies and later under [[Garfield Barwick]] and [[Paul Hasluck]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=84}} In February 1962, he was also made minister-in-charge of the [[CSIRO]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=96}} During [[question time]] in the Senate, he represented ministers from the House of Representatives, allowing him to gain experience in portfolios beyond his own.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=84}}{{efn|In Australia, ministers are drawn from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Menzies had a personal interest in education, having previously handled the portfolio himself,{{efn|There was no separate education department at the time, with the portfolio instead handled by the Commonwealth Education Office within the [[Prime Minister's Department (Australia)|Prime Minister's Department]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=104}}}} and told Gorton that it should be his primary focus.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=103}} He was given oversight of the Australian Universities Commission, the [[Australian National University]], the [[National Archives of Australia|Commonwealth Archives Office]], the [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]], and the [[National Library of Australia]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=104}} In January 1966, Menzies retired and [[Harold Holt]] became prime minister. Gorton was elevated to [[Cabinet of Australia|cabinet]],{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=100}} and at the end of the year was given the title [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Minister for Education and Science]]. He was placed in charge of the new [[Department of Education and Science (Australia)|Department of Education and Science]], the first time those portfolios had been given a separate department at federal level.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Frame| authorlink=Tom Frame (bishop)|title=The Life and Death of Harold Holt|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=2005|isbn=1-74114-672-0|page=168}}</ref>\n\n[[File:JohnGorton.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Senator Gorton in 1967]]\nGorton presided over a \"major intrusion\" of the federal government into the education sector.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=121}} His tenure saw significant increases in the number of university scholarships available, the number of new university entrants, and overall funding of education.{{efn|Between 1963 and 1966, the number of Commonwealth scholarships on offer rose from 4,701 to 8,069, an increase of 72 percent, while the number of new university entrants rose from 17,311 to 24,196, an increase of 40 percent. Total federal funding of education rose by 77 percent from the 1964\u201365 budget to the 1967\u201368 budget.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}}} One of the first major issues Gorton confronted was that of state aid to non-government schools. He believed that private schools should have equal access to federal government funding, and in 1964 announced that the government would fund science laboratories for private schools.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=109\u2013111}} This stance, supported by the [[Catholic education in Australia|Catholic education sector]] but opposed by secularists and most Protestant schools, eventually achieved widespread acceptance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/CIB9697/97cib2|title=State Aid for Non-Government Schools: The emerging debate|first=Greg|last=McIntosh|year=1996|publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library}}</ref> In September 1965, Gorton created the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education, tasked with advising the government on non-university [[technical and further education]] (TAFE). He announced that the federal government would fund technical colleges on a pro-rata basis with the states,{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=111\u2013112}} and personally oversaw the establishment of the Canberra College of Advanced Education, the forerunner of the [[University of Canberra]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=114\u2013115}} As science minister, he lent his support to the [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] project, securing cabinet approval for its construction in April 1967.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=120\u2013121}}\n\n==Prime Minister==\n===Holt's disappearance===\n{{See also|Disappearance of Harold Holt|Liberal Party of Australia leadership election, 1968}}\n[[File:John_Gorton_Swearing_In.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton being sworn in as Prime Minister on 10 January 1968.]]\n[[Harold Holt]] disappeared while swimming on 17 December 1967 and was declared presumed drowned two days later. His presumed successor was Liberal deputy leader [[William McMahon]].  However, on 18 December, the Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister [[John McEwen]] announced that if McMahon were named the new Liberal leader, he and his party would not serve under him.  His reasons were never stated publicly, but in a private meeting with McMahon, he said \"I will not serve under you because I do not trust you\".<ref>Gavin Souter, ''Acts of Parliament'', 1988, pp. 478\u201379</ref> McEwen's shock declaration triggered a leadership crisis within the Liberal Party; even more significantly, it raised the threat of a possible breaking of the Coalition, which would spell electoral disaster for the Liberals.  Up to that time, the Liberals had never won enough seats in any House of Representatives election to be able to govern without Country Party support.  Indeed, since the Coalition's formation in 1923, the major non-[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] party had only been able to govern alone once, during [[Joseph Lyons]]' first ministry. Even then, Lyons' [[United Australia Party]] had come up four seats short of a majority in its own right, and was only able to garner a bare majority of two when the five members of the [[Emergency Committee of South Australia]] joined the UAP party room.\n\nThe Governor-General [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]] swore McEwen in as Prime Minister, on an interim basis pending the Liberal Party electing its new leader. McEwen agreed to accept an interim appointment provided there was no formal statement of time limit. This appointment was in keeping with previous occasions when a conservative Coalition government had been deprived of its leader.<ref>In 1939 when [[Joseph Lyons]] died suddenly, and in 1941 when [[Robert Menzies]] resigned, the Governor-General had commissioned the (unofficial) Deputy Prime Minister, who was the leader of the Country Party, to serve as Prime Minister until the major coalition partner\u2014then the UAP\u2014could choose its new leader.</ref> Casey also concurred in the view put to him by McEwen that to commission a Liberal temporarily as Prime Minister would give that person an unfair advantage in the forthcoming party room ballot for the permanent leader.\n[[File:John_Gorton_1968_colour.jpg|thumb|right|Gorton in his office in 1968.]]\nIn the subsequent [[1968 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|leadership struggle]], Gorton was championed by Army Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]], Government Whip in the Senate [[Malcolm Scott]] and Liberal Party Whip [[Dudley Erwin]], and with their support he was able to defeat rivals [[Paul Hasluck]], [[Les Bury]] and [[Billy Snedden]] to become Liberal leader even though he was a member of the Senate.  He was elected party leader on 9 January 1968, and appointed Prime Minister on 10 January, replacing McEwen.  He was the only Senator in Australia's history to be Prime Minister and the only Prime Minister to have ever served in the Senate.  He remained a Senator until, in accordance with the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] tradition that the Prime Minister is a member of the lower house of parliament, he resigned on 1 February 1968 to contest the by-election for Holt's old House of Representatives seat of [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]] in south Melbourne.  The by-election in this comfortably safe Liberal seat was held on 24 February; there were three other candidates, but Gorton achieved a massive 68% of the formal vote.  He visited all the polling booths during the day, but was unable to vote for himself as he was still enrolled in [[Division of Mallee|Mallee]], in rural western Victoria.<ref>''the age(melbourne)magazine'', p. 16</ref> Between 2 and 23 February (both dates inclusive) he was a member of neither house of parliament.\n\n===Activities in office===\n[[File:John Gorton 1969.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton at the [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] during the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing in 1969]]\nGorton was initially a very popular Prime Minister. He carved out a style quite distinct from those of his predecessors \u2013 the aloof Menzies and the affable, sporty Holt. Gorton liked to portray himself as a man of the people who enjoyed a beer and a gamble, with a bit of a [[larrikinism|\"larrikin\"]] streak about him. Unfortunately for him, this reputation later came back to haunt him.\n\nHe also began to follow new policies, pursuing independent defence and foreign policies and distancing Australia from its traditional ties to Britain. But he continued to support Australia's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], a position he had reluctantly inherited from Holt, which became increasingly unpopular after 1968. On domestic issues, he favoured centralist policies at the expense of the states, which alienated powerful Liberal state leaders like Sir [[Henry Bolte]] of Victoria and [[Robert Askin|Bob Askin]] of New South Wales. He also fostered an independent [[Australian film industry]] and increased government funding for the arts.\nGorton proved to be a surprisingly poor media performer and public speaker, and was portrayed by the media as a foolish and incompetent administrator. He was unlucky to come up against a new and formidable Labor Opposition Leader in [[Gough Whitlam]]. Also, he was subjected to media speculation about his drinking habits and his involvements with women. He generated great resentment within his party, and his opponents became increasingly critical of his reliance on an inner circle of advisers \u2013 most notably his private secretary [[Ainsley Gotto]].\n\nThe Coalition suffered a 7% swing against it at the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 election]], and Labor outpolled it on the [[two-party-preferred vote]]. During the close election Gorton promised to waive all future government rent on residential leaseholders in Canberra.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=Yu-Hung|title=Myths and Realities of Public Land Leasing: Canberra and Hong Kong|journal=Land Lines|date=March 1999|volume=11|issue=2|url=https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/361_linc_landlines%203.99.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref> After surviving the election Gorton came through on his promise, giving away an estimated $100&nbsp;million in equity to leaseholders and abandoning future government rent revenue.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Karl|title=Canberra's Leasehold Land System|url=http://www.prosper.org.au/2008/01/16/canberra/|website=Prosper Australia|accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Still, Gorton saw the sizeable 45-seat majority he had inherited from Holt cut down to only seven.  Indeed, the Coalition might have lost government had it not been for the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]]'s longstanding practice of preferencing against the ALP.  The Coalition was only assured of a ninth term in government when DLP preferences tipped four marginal seats in Melbourne \u2014the DLP's heartland\u2014to the Liberals.  Had those preferences gone the other way, Whitlam would have become Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2007/results/senate/vic.htm Analysis of 2007 election in Victoria] by [[Antony Green]]</ref>\n\n===Leadership challenges and resignation===\n[[File:Gorton_and_McMahon.jpg|thumb|Gorton with [[William McMahon]] shortly after the unsuccessful leadership challenge in 1969.]]\nAfter the 1969 election, Gorton [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1969|was unsuccessfully challenged for the Liberal leadership]] by McMahon and National Development Minister [[David Fairbairn (politician)|David Fairbairn]]. With the Liberals falling further behind Labor in the polls in 1971, a challenge was launched in March when Defence Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] resigned.  Fraser had strongly supported Gorton for the leadership two years earlier, but now attacked Gorton on the floor of parliament in his resignation speech, saying that Gorton was \"not fit to hold the great office of Prime Minister.\"\n\nGorton called [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1971|a Liberal caucus meeting]] for 10 March 1971 to settle the matter. A motion of confidence in his leadership was tied. Under Liberal caucus rules of the time, a tied vote meant the motion was passed and hence Gorton could have remained as party leader and Prime Minister without further ado.  However, he took it upon himself to resign, saying \"Well, that is not a vote of confidence, so the party will have to elect a new leader.\"<ref>Neil Brown, ''On the Other Hand ... Sketches and Reflections from Political Life'', The Popular Press, 1993, p. 59</ref> A ballot was held and McMahon was elected leader and thus Prime Minister. Australian television marked the end of Gorton's stormy premiership with a newsreel montage accompanied by [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra's]] anthem \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\".\n\nIn a surprise move, Gorton contested and won the position of Deputy Leader, forcing McMahon to make him Defence Minister. This farcical situation ended within five months when McMahon sacked him for disloyalty.\n\n==Final years in parliament==\n[[File:President Nixon meeting with the Hon.Jack G Gorton - NARA - 194715.tif|thumb|left|Gorton meeting with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Alexander Haig]] in April 1971]]\nA number of polls during McMahon's prime ministership had Gorton as both the preferred Liberal leader and the preferred prime minister. In 1972, businessman [[David Hains]] commissioned a series of polls in marginal electorates that showed the Coalition would significantly increase its vote if Gorton mounted a successful comeback; for instance, polling in the [[Division of Henty]] found that his return would add eight points to the Liberal vote. However, Gorton generally downplayed the polling and did not mount an active campaign to oust McMahon.<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 362\u2013363.</ref> Labor went on to win a nine-seat majority at the [[1972 Australian federal election|1972 election]], ending 23 consecutive years of Coalition rule.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 364.</ref> A number of Gorton's contemporaries \u2013 including Country Party leader [[Doug Anthony]] and Labor ministers [[Clyde Cameron]], [[Doug McClelland]], and [[John Wheeldon]] \u2013 retrospectively expressed doubts as to whether Whitlam could have won if Gorton had returned to the prime ministership. [[Rupert Murdoch]], whose newspapers endorsed the Labor Party, stated in 2000 that \"we would most certainly have supported the re-election of a Gorton Government in 1972. And he would have won!\".<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 365.</ref>\n\nMcMahon resigned as Liberal leader a few weeks after the 1972 election. Gorton was one of five candidates who stood [[1972 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|the resulting leadership ballot]], but polled only the fourth-highest total as [[Billy Snedden]] won a narrow victory over [[Nigel Bowen]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110626409|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=21 December 1972|title=Snedden faces his first problems}}</ref> Snedden subsequently appointed him to the opposition frontbench as spokesman for urban and regional development, the environment, and conservation.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=30 January 1973|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110704896|title=Snedden names 'Shadow' team}}</ref> Soon after being sworn in as prime minister, Whitlam responded to a congratulatory letter from Gorton by promising to \"advance some of the causes which you were the first Australian Prime Minister to identify\". Over the following years, several failed initiatives from Gorton's prime ministership were passed into law by the [[Whitlam Government]]. This included the establishment of the [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]] and the assertion of sovereignty over the territorial seabed and continental shelf.<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 366\u2013367.</ref>\n\n===Social liberalism===\nEarly in 1973, Gorton stated his public support of \"abortion on request, under certain conditions\"; he was opposed to \"compulsory pregnancy\". He nonetheless voted against [[David McKenzie (Victorian politician)|David McKenzie]] and [[Tony Lamb]]'s private member's bill to legalise abortion in the Australian Capital Territory, as he believed it did not provide clear enough guidelines for medical practitioners. He preferred the conditions of the [[Menhennitt ruling]].<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 367\u2013368.</ref> Gorton was also a supporter of no-fault divorce.

It was modelled on the recommendations of the UK's [[Wolfenden report]]. While noting his personal objections to homosexuality, Gorton stated that most gay people \"hurt no one, harm no one and yet have this hanging over them\". He dismissed arguments that decriminalisation would violate \"God's law\", noting that many religious leaders were in favour of a change, and stated that the existing law had led to \"[[Gay bashing|bashing]]\", blackmail, and suicides. The motion passed by 24 votes, with all parties receiving a [[conscience vote]].

She was a language student at the [[Sorbonne]]. This meeting came about through Gorton's friend from Oxford, Arthur Brown, who was Bettina's brother. In 1935, Gorton and Bettina Brown were married in Oxford. After his studies were finished, they settled in Australia, taking over his father's orchard, \"Mystic Park\", at [[Lake Kangaroo, Victoria|Lake Kangaroo]] near [[Kerang]], Victoria. They had three children: Joanna, Michael and Robin. Gorton's first wife died of cancer in 1983. In 1993, he remarried to Nancy Home (n\u00e9e Elliott) a long-time acquaintance.<ref name=naabg>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/spouse.aspx|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|title=Bettina Gorton|accessdate=24 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315145301/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/spouse.aspx|archive-date=15 March 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nGorton was a nominal Christian at least in the early part of his life, but was not a churchgoer. Some sources have identified him as agnostic or even atheist. He attended Anglican schools, and was influenced by the [[Christian socialist]] views of [[James Ralph Darling]], his headmaster at [[Geelong Grammar]].<ref>Williams, Roy (2013). ''In God They Trust?'', Bible Society Australia, p. 149.</ref> In a 1948 speech, Gorton said that \"the story of Christianity is the most tremendous in the history of the world\".<ref>Williams: 151.</ref> However, in the lead-up to the [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]] he publicly opposed mentioning God in the preamble. According to his biographer Ian Hancock: \"Gorton may not have been a believing, let alone a practising, Christian, and when he spoke of religion of 'the soul' he did not have a particular faith in mind. Rather, his religion was founded upon the injunction in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]: 'Man doth not live by bread only'.\"<ref>Hancock: 107</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n[[File:John Gorton bust.jpg|thumb|Bust

of Australia|nineteenth]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]], in office from 1968 to 1971. He led the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] during that time, having previously been a long-serving government minister.\n\nGorton was born out of wedlock and had a turbulent childhood. He studied at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], after finishing his secondary education at [[Geelong Grammar School]], and then returned to Australia to take over his father's property in northern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Gorton enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1940, and served as a fighter pilot in [[Malayan Campaign|Malaya]] and [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] during the Second World War. He suffered severe facial injuries in a crash landing on [[Bintan Island]] in 1942, and whilst being evacuated; his ship was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. He returned to farming after being discharged in 1944, and was elected to the [[Shire of Kerang|Kerang Shire Council]] in 1946; he later served a term as shire president.\n\nAfter a previous unsuccessful candidacy at state level, Gorton was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] at the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 federal election]]. He took a keen interest in foreign policy, and gained a reputation as a strident [[anti-Communist]]. Gorton was promoted to the ministry in 1958, and over the following decade held a variety of different portfolios in the governments of [[Robert Menzies]] and [[Harold Holt]]. He was responsible at various times for the Navy, public works, education, and science. He was elevated to the Cabinet in 1966, and the following year, he was promoted to [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Australia)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]].\n\nGorton [[1968 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|defeated]] three other candidates for the Liberal leadership after [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|Harold Holt's disappearance]] on 17 December 1967. He became the first and only senator to assume the office of Prime Minister, but soon transferred to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in line with constitutional convention. The [[Gorton Government]] continued [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australian involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], but began withdrawing troops amid growing public discontent. It retained office at the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 federal election]], albeit with a severely reduced majority. Gorton's domestic policies, which emphasised [[centralisation]] and [[economic nationalism]], were often controversial in his own party, and his individualistic style alienated many of his Cabinet members. He resigned as Liberal leader in 1971 after a [[confidence motion]] in his leadership was tied, and was replaced by [[William McMahon]].\n\nAfter losing the premiership, Gorton was elected deputy leader under McMahon and appointed [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]]. He was sacked for disloyalty after a few months. After the Coalition's defeat at the [[1972 Australian federal election|1972 federal election]], Gorton [[1972 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|unsuccessfully stood]] as McMahon's replacement. He briefly served as an opposition [[frontbencher]] under [[Billy Snedden]], but stood down in 1974 and spent the rest of his career as a [[backbencher]]. Gorton resigned from the Liberal Party when [[Malcolm Fraser]] was elected leader, and at the [[1975 Australian federal election|1975 election]] mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate as an [[Independent politician|independent]]. He later spent several years as a political commentator, retiring from public life in 1981.\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth and family background===\n[[File:JohnGorton1913.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton as a toddler in 1913]]\n[[File:NlaGortonmotherAlice1915.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton as a child and his mother Alice in 1915]]\nJohn Grey Gorton was the second child of Alice Sinn and John Rose Gorton; his older sister Ruth was born in 1909. He had no birth certificate, but on official forms recorded his date of birth as 9 September 1911 and his place of birth as [[Wellington]], New Zealand. His birth was registered in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as occurring on that date, but in the inner [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. However, that document contained a number of inaccuracies \u2013 his name was given as \"John Alga Gordon\", his parents were recorded as husband and wife, his father's name was incorrect, and his sister was recorded as deceased.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Hancock|title=John Gorton: He Did It His Way|publisher=Hodder|year=2002|page=1|isbn=0733614396}}</ref> At some point, Gorton's father told him that he had actually been born in Wellington. There are no records of his birth in New Zealand, but his parents are known to have travelled there on several occasions.<ref name=p2>Hancock (2002), p. 2.</ref> John Gorton apparently believed he was born in Wellington, listing the city as his place of birth on his RAAF enlistment papers.<ref>[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/before-office.aspx Before office - John Gorton], National Archives of Australia. Retrieved 6 November 2019.</ref> \n\nIf John Gorton was indeed born in New Zealand, this would have made him a New Zealand citizen from 1 January 1949 under changes to [[New Zealand nationality law]]. Holding dual-citizenship would have rendered Gorton ineligible to sit in Australia's federal parliament under [[Section 44 of the Australian Constitution]]. Gorton's eligibility to have sat in parliament throughout his career is therefore unclear.<ref>[https://williamsummers.blog/2017/08/07/section-44-twist-former-aussie-pm-was-probably-ineligible-for-parliament-due-to-multiple-citizenship/ Section 44 twist: Former Aussie PM was probably ineligible due to multiple citizenship], William Summers (blog). Retrieved 6 November 2019.</ref>\n\nGorton's father was born to a middle-class family in [[Manchester]], [[England]], UK. As a young man he moved to [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, where he went into business as a merchant \u2013 during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], he developed a reputation as a [[War profiteering|war profiteer]]. He reputedly escaped the [[Siege of Ladysmith]] by sneaking through Boer lines, and then made his way to Australia.<ref name=p3>Hancock (2002), p. 3.</ref> He was involved in various business schemes in multiple states, and was to said to have \"lived on the brink of a fortune which never quite materialised\".<ref name=p4>Hancock (2002), p. 4.</ref> One of his business partners was the inventor [[George Julius]].<ref name=p3/> At some point, Gorton's father separated from his first wife, Kathleen O'Brien, and began living with Alice Sinn \u2013 born in Melbourne to a German father and an Irish mother.<ref name=p2/> However, Kathleen refused to grant him a divorce. Some official documents record Gorton's parents as having married in New Zealand at some point, but there are no records of this occurring; any such marriage would have been bigamous. Gorton never denied his illegitimacy as an adult, but it did not become generally known until a biography was published during his premiership.<ref name=p4/>\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:JohnGorton1930.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton as a student at Geelong Grammar School in 1930; he is seated to the left]]\nGorton spent his early years living with his maternal grandparents in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]], as his parents were frequently away on business trips. When he was about four years old, his parents took him to live with them in Sydney, where they had an apartment at [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]]. Gorton began his education at Edgecliff Preparatory School.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 5.</ref> When he was eight years old, his mother contracted tuberculosis and was sent to a [[sanatorium]] to avoid passing on the disease. She died in September 1920, aged 32. Gorton's grieving father sent his son to live with his estranged wife Kathleen. There, he met his sister Ruth for the first time; he had previously been told that she was dead. Although she was his full sibling, she had been raised by Kathleen since birth, and rarely saw her biological parents. Gorton initially lived with Kathleen and Ruth at their home in [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]]. They later moved into a larger house in [[Killara, New South Wales|Killara]], in the north of Sydney.<ref name=hp8>Hancock (2002), p. 8.</ref>\n\nWhile living in Killara, Gorton began attending Headfort College, a short-lived private school run by a former Anglican minister.<ref name=hp8/> In 1924, he began boarding at [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School]] (Shore), initially on a weekly basis but later on a full-time one.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 9.</ref> He did not excel academically, failing the [[Intermediate Certificate (Australia)|Intermediate Certificate]] on his first attempt, but was a well-liked boy and good at sports.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 10.</ref> Gorton began spending his holidays with his father, who had purchased a property in [[Mystic Park, Victoria]], and planted a citrus orchard.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 11.</ref> He left Shore at the end of 1926, and the following year began boarding at [[Geelong Grammar School]], which he would attend for four years from 1927\u201330.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 12.</ref> He represented the school in athletics, [[Australian rules football|football]], and rowing, and in his final year was a school prefect and house captain.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 15.</ref>\n\n===University===\nAfter leaving Geelong Grammar, Gorton spent a year working on his father's property in Mystic Park. His father then took out a second mortgage to allow him to travel to England and attend [[Oxford University]]. Gorton arrived in England in early-1932, and after a period at a \"cramming school\" passed the exam to enter [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]]. He also took flying lessons around the same time, and was awarded a pilot's licence in June 1932. Gorton began his degree in October 1932 and finished in June 1935 with an \"[[Upper-second class|upper second]]\" in History, Politics, and Economics. He was initially something of an outsider, with relatively little money and no social connections. However, his prowess in rowing \u2013 he won the O.U.B.C. Fours in his first year, and was Captain of the [[Brasenose College Boat Club]] \u2013 saw him elected to [[Vincent's Club]] and [[Leander Club]]. In 1934, while on holiday in [[Second Spanish Republic|Spain]], he met his future wife [[Bettina Gorton|Bettina Brown]], the younger sister of one of his College friends. They married in early 1935.<ref name=bdas>[http://biography.senate.gov.au/gorton-john-grey GORTON, SIR JOHN GREY (1911\u20132002)], Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate (Online Edition).

He had expected to take up a position at [[The Herald and Weekly Times]], [[Keith Murdoch]]'s newspaper group. However, he arrived in Melbourne to find his father in failing health; he died in August 1936. Gorton had taken over the management of his father's orchard as soon as he entered hospital. He inherited an overdraft of \u00a35,000, which took several years to pay off. However, the property \u2013 located on the western side of [[North Victorian Wetlands|Kangaroo Lake]] \u2013 was in good condition, requiring only minor improvements. He employed up to ten seasonal workers during picking season. Mystic Park remained his primary residence until he was appointed to the ministry, at which point he and his family moved to Canberra.<ref name=bdas/>\n\n==Military service==\n\n===1940\u20131942===\n[[File:JohnGortonWW21941.jpg|thumb|left|Pilot Officer Gorton]]\n[[File:JohnGorton1941.jpg|thumb|right|Gorton prior to leaving for war service in 1941]]\nOn 31 May 1940, following the outbreak of World War II, Gorton enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] Reserve.<ref>Hancock: 30</ref> At the age of 29, Gorton was considered too old for pilot training, but he re-applied in September after this rule was relaxed. Gorton was accepted and commissioned into the RAAF on 8 November 1940.<ref>Hancock: 31</ref> He trained as a fighter pilot at [[Somers, Victoria]] and [[Wagga Wagga]], [[New South Wales]], before being sent to the UK. Gorton completed his training at [[RAF Heston]] and [[RAF Honiley]],<ref name=\"Trengrove: 71\">Trengrove: 71</ref> with [[No. 61 Operational Training Unit RAF]], flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s.<ref name=\"Hancock: 33\">Hancock: 33</ref> He was disappointed when his first operational posting was [[No. 135 Squadron RAF]], a [[Hawker Hurricane]] unit, as he considered the type greatly inferior to Spitfires.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 71\"/>\n\nDuring late 1941, Gorton and other members of his squadron became part of the [[En cadre|cadre]] of a Hurricane [[wing (air force unit)|wing]] being formed for service in the Middle East. They were sent by sea, with 50 Hurricanes in crates, travelling around Africa to reduce the risk of attack. In December, when the ship was at [[Durban]], South Africa, it was diverted to Singapore, after [[Pacific War|Japan entered the war]].<ref>Trengrove: 72</ref> As it approached its destination in mid-January, [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces were [[Battle of Malaya|advancing down the Malayan Peninsula]]. The ship was attacked on at least one occasion by Japanese aircraft, but arrived and unloaded safely after tropical storms made enemy air raids impossible.<ref>Trengrove: 73\u201374</ref> As the Hurricanes were assembled, the pilots were formed into a composite operational squadron, [[No. 232 Squadron RAF]].\n\nIn late January 1942, the squadron became operational and joined the remnants of several others that had been in Malaya, operating out of [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]] and RAF [[Kallang]].<ref>Trengrove: 75</ref> During one of his first [[sortie]]s, Gorton was involved in a brief dogfight over the [[South China Sea]], after which he suffered engine failure and was forced to land on [[Bintan]] island,<ref name=\"Hancock: 33\"/> 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) south east of Singapore. As he landed, one of the Hurricane's wheels hit an embankment and flipped over. Gorton was not properly strapped in and his face hit the gun sight and windscreen, mutilating his nose and breaking both cheekbones.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 76\">Trengrove: 76</ref> He also suffered severe lacerations to both arms. He made his way out of the wreck and was rescued by members of the [[Royal Dutch East Indies Army]], who provided some medical treatment. Gorton later claimed that his face was so badly cut and bruised, that a member of the RAF sent to collect him assumed he was near death, collected his personal effects and returned to Singapore without him.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 76\"/> By chance, one week later, Sgt Matt O'Mara of [[No. 453 Squadron RAAF]] also crash landed on Bintan, and arranged for them to be collected.<ref name=\"Trengrove: 77\">Trengrove: 77</ref>\n\nThey arrived back in Singapore, on 11 February, three days after [[battle of Singapore|the island had been invaded]].<ref name=\"Trengrove: 77\"/> As the Allied air force units on Singapore had been destroyed or evacuated by this stage, Gorton was put on the ''Derrymore'', an ammunition ship bound for [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (Jakarta). On 13 February, as it neared its destination, the ship was torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-55 [[Kaidai class submarine]] and the ''Derrymore'' was abandoned. Gorton then spent almost a day on a crowded liferaft, in shark-infested waters, with little drinking water, until the raft was spotted by [[HMAS Ballarat (J184)|HMAS ''Ballarat'']], which picked up the passengers and took them to Batavia.<ref>Trengrove: 80</ref>\n\n[[File:77_Sqn_RAAF_pilots_%26_Kittyhawk_(AWM_NWA0019).JPG|thumb|left|Pilots of B Flight, No. 77 Squadron with a P-40 Kittyhawk in the Northern Territory, January 1943.

However, he was more concerned about the effect that the sight of his mutilated face would have on his wife. It is reported that Betty Gorton, who had been running the farm in his absence, was relieved to see Gorton alive.<ref name=\"Hancock: 33\"/><ref>Trengrove: 82</ref>\n\n===1942\u20131944===\n\nAfter arriving in Australia he was posted to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] on 12 August 1942 with [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF]] (Kittyhawks). During this time he was involved in his second air accident.  While flying [[P-40E]] A29-60 on 7 September 1942, he was forced to land due to an incorrectly set fuel cock. Both Gorton and his aircraft were recovered several days later after spending time in the bush. On 21 February 1943 the squadron was relocated to [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]].<ref name=naaws>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/before-office.aspx#section2 |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |title=John Gorton, Before office, War service 1940\u201345 | accessdate= 24 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nGorton's final air incident came on 18 March 1943. His A29-192 Kittyhawk's engine failed on takeoff, causing the aircraft to flip at the end of the strip. Gorton was unhurt. In March 1944, Gorton was sent back to Australia with the rank of Flight Lieutenant. His final posting was as a Flying Instructor with [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No. 2 Operational Training Unit]] at [[Mildura]], Victoria.  He was then discharged from the RAAF on 5 December 1944.<ref name=naaws/>\n\nDuring late 1944 Gorton went to [[Austin Hospital, Melbourne|Heidelberg Hospital]] for surgery which could not fully repair his facial injuries; he was left permanently disfigured.<ref name=naaws/>\n\n==Early political involvement==\nAfter resuming his life in Mystic Park, Gorton was elected unopposed to the [[Shire of Kerang|Kerang Shire Council]] in September 1946. He remained on the council until 1952, overlapping with his first term in the Senate, and from 1949 to 1950 served as shire president.<ref name=p46>Hancock (2002), p. 46.</ref> Although he had little previous experience, Gorton began to develop a reputation as a powerful public speaker. His first major speech, in April 1946, was an address to a welcome-home gathering for returned soldiers at the Mystic Park Hall. In what [[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]] has described as \"Australia's best unknown political speech\",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/when-heartfelt-oratory-gave-us-a-political-vision-to-believe-in/news-story/f6e976b88facb7aef45be610e8025547|title=When heartfelt oratory gave us a political vision to believe in|author=[[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]]|date=1 July 2016|access-date=21 September 2018|work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref> he exhorted his audience to honour those who had died in the war by building \"a world in which meanness and poverty, tyranny and hate, have no existence\". Gorton's next major speech was made in September 1947, at a rally against the [[Chifley Government]]'s attempt to nationalise private banks. He told the crowd in [[Kerang]] that they should oppose the establishment of banks run by politicians, and objected in particular to the government's decision not to take the issue to a referendum.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 49.</ref> According to his biographer Ian Hancock, \"the bank nationalisation issue marked his advance beyond purely local politics and stamped him firmly and publicly as an anti-socialist\".<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 51.</ref>\n\nGorton had been a supporter of the [[Country Party (Victoria)|Country Party]] before the war, along with most of his neighbours. Over time, he became frustrated with the party's frequent squabbles with the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] and its willingness to cooperate with the [[Australian Labor Party (Victorian Branch)|Labor Party]].<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 52.</ref> After the Victorian Country Party withdrew from [[Coalition (Australia)|its coalition]] with the Liberals in December 1948, Gorton became involved in efforts to form a new anti-socialist movement that would absorb both parties. At some point he was introduced to [[Magnus Cormack]], the state president of the Liberals, who became something of a mentor.<ref name=p53>Hancock (2002), pp. 53\u201354.</ref> In March 1949, Gorton was elected to the state executive of the new organisation, which named itself the [[Liberal and Country Party]] (LCP).<ref name=p55>Hancock (2002), p. 55.</ref> On a number of occasions he addressed Country Party gatherings, urging its members to join the new party and stressing that it would not neglect rural interests, as many feared.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 56.</ref> However, the LCP did not achieve its goal of uniting the anti-Labor forces, as most Country Party members viewed it as simply a takeover attempt; the new party affiliated with the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia]].<ref name=p53/>\n\nIn June 1949, Gorton stood for the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] as the LCP candidate in [[Northern Province (Victoria)|Northern Province]]. It was a safe Country Party seat, and at the preceding three elections no other parties had bothered to field a candidate.<ref name=p55/> Making right-wing unity the focal point of his campaign, Gorton polled 48.8 percent of the vote to finish less than 400 votes behind the sitting member, [[George Tuckett (politician)|George Tuckett]]. The result impressed the LCP's leadership,<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 57.</ref> and the following month he was [[preselection|preselected]] in third place on its joint [[Australian Senate|Senate]] ticket with the Country Party. He was relatively unknown within the party, and his rural background was a major factor in his selection.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 58.</ref> The Coalition won a large majority at the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 federal election]], including four out of Victoria's seven senators. The LCP candidates joined the parliamentary Liberal Party.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 59.</ref>\n\n==Senate (1950\u20131968)==\n===Backbencher===\n[[File:JohnGorton1954.JPG|thumb|left|Gorton in 1954]]\nGorton's term in the Senate began on 22 February 1950.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=61}} He was re-elected to additional terms at the [[1951 Australian federal election|1951]], [[1953 Australian Senate election|1953]], [[1958 Australian federal election|1958]], and [[1964 Australian Senate election|1964 elections]], and from 1953 occupied first place on the Coalition's ticket in Victoria. Gorton's early speeches on domestic policy foreshadowed the stances and policy initiatives he would later adopt as prime minister, such as economic nationalism, support for a strong central government, and support for nuclear energy. One of his first notable actions in the Senate came in November 1951, when he successfully moved a motion opposing \"any substantial measure of ownership or control over any Australian broadcasting station\" being granted to non-Australians.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=73}} In his early speeches on foreign policy, Gorton drew analogies between the actions of the Soviet Union and Communist China and those of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=68}} He developed a reputation as a \"hardline [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]]\", speaking in favour of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill and campaigning for the \"Yes\" vote during the [[1951 Australian Communist Party ban referendum|1951 referendum]] to ban the [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=64\u201366}} At a campaign rally in September 1951, he had to be restrained by police after attempting to drag a heckler from his seat and shouting at him to \"come outside, you yellow rat\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/23077920|title=Women rush from hall|publisher=[[Melbourne Argus]]|date=5 September 1951}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1952 to 1958, Gorton served on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, including as chairman for a period. He developed a keen interest in Asia, which was rooted in his anti-communism, and joined parliamentary delegations to Malaya, South Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. He strongly supported Australia joining the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO), a collective defence initiative designed to [[domino theory|prevent the spread of communism]] in the region. He also supported [[Taiwanese independence]] and opposed Australian recognition of the People's Republic of China (PRC).{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=67}} On a number of occasions, Gorton spoke of the need for Australia to develop a foreign policy independent of Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=68}} In May 1957, he told the Senate that Australia should acquire its own nuclear deterrent, including intercontinental missiles.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=69}}\n\n===Government minister===\n====Navy====\n[[File:Paul Hasluck, Shen Chang-huan, John Gorton.jpg|thumb|right|Gorton in 1965 with External Affairs Minister [[Paul Hasluck]] and Taiwanese foreign minister [[Shen Chang-huan]]]]\nGorton was elevated to the ministry after the [[1958 Australian federal election|1958 election]], as [[Minister for the Navy (Australia)|Minister for the Navy]]. This was a junior position subordinate to the Minister for Defence, [[Athol Townley]]. Although his promotion was unexpected,{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=81}} he would serve as Minister for the Navy for more than five years, the longest-serving navy minister in Australia's history.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=96}} Gorton regularly attended meetings of the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Naval Board]], unlike previous ministers, and championed its recommendations at cabinet meetings. He was able to secure most elements of the board's desired modernisation program, despite Townley showing more interest in the air force. During Gorton's tenure, the navy acquired four Australian-built frigates and six British-built minesweepers, as well as placing orders for three [[Charles F. Adams-class destroyer|''Charles F. Adams''-class destroyer]]s and four [[Oberon-class submarine|''Oberon''-class submarine]]s. He postponed the phasing out of the [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]], due to occur in 1963, and secured the purchase of 27 [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=87\u201390}}\n\nGorton was a supporter and admirer of Robert Menzies, who was sympathetic to his ambitions for higher office and assigned him additional responsibilities. In 1959, he was tasked with securing the passage of the Matrimonial Causes Bill, which introduced uniform divorce laws; he described it as \"a systematic attempt to make a new approach to the problem of divorce\". The bill was opposed by religious conservatives (mostly Catholics) on both sides of politics, but it eventually passed the Senate with only a single amendment.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|pp=85\u201386}} Gorton was appointed assistant minister to the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for External Affairs]] in February 1960, working under Menzies and later under [[Garfield Barwick]] and [[Paul Hasluck]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=84}} In February 1962, he was also made minister-in-charge of the [[CSIRO]].{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=96}} During [[question time]] in the Senate, he represented ministers from the House of Representatives, allowing him to gain experience in portfolios beyond his own.{{sfn|Hancock|2002|p=84}}{{efn|In Australia, ministers are drawn from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

His presumed successor was Liberal deputy leader [[William McMahon]].  However, on 18 December, the Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister [[John McEwen]] announced that if McMahon were named the new Liberal leader, he and his party would not serve under him.  His reasons were never stated publicly, but in a private meeting with McMahon, he said \"I will not serve under you because I do not trust you\".<ref>Gavin Souter, ''Acts of Parliament'', 1988, pp. 478\u201379</ref> McEwen's shock declaration triggered a leadership crisis within the Liberal Party; even more significantly, it raised the threat of a possible breaking of the Coalition, which would spell electoral disaster for the Liberals.  Up to that time, the Liberals had never won enough seats in any House of Representatives election to be able to govern without Country Party support.  Indeed, since the Coalition's formation in 1923, the major non-[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] party had only been able to govern alone once, during [[Joseph Lyons]]' first ministry. Even then, Lyons' [[United Australia Party]] had come up four seats short of a majority in its own right, and was only able to garner a bare majority of two when the five members of the [[Emergency Committee of South Australia]] joined the UAP party room.\n\nThe Governor-General [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]] swore McEwen in as Prime Minister, on an interim basis pending the Liberal Party electing its new leader. McEwen agreed to accept an interim appointment provided there was no formal statement of time limit. This appointment was in keeping with previous occasions when a conservative Coalition government had been deprived of its leader.<ref>In 1939 when [[Joseph Lyons]] died suddenly, and in 1941 when [[Robert Menzies]] resigned, the Governor-General had commissioned the (unofficial) Deputy Prime Minister, who was the leader of the Country Party, to serve as Prime Minister until the major coalition partner\u2014then the UAP\u2014could choose its new leader.</ref> Casey also concurred in the view put to him by McEwen that to commission a Liberal temporarily as Prime Minister would give that person an unfair advantage in the forthcoming party room ballot for the permanent leader.\n[[File:John_Gorton_1968_colour.jpg|thumb|right|Gorton in his office in 1968.]]\nIn the subsequent [[1968 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|leadership struggle]], Gorton was championed by Army Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]], Government Whip in the Senate [[Malcolm Scott]] and Liberal Party Whip [[Dudley Erwin]], and with their support he was able to defeat rivals [[Paul Hasluck]], [[Les Bury]] and [[Billy Snedden]] to become Liberal leader even though he was a member of the Senate.  He was elected party leader on 9 January 1968, and appointed Prime Minister on 10 January, replacing McEwen.  He was the only Senator in Australia's history to be Prime Minister and the only Prime Minister to have ever served in the Senate.  He remained a Senator until, in accordance with the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] tradition that the Prime Minister is a member of the lower house of parliament, he resigned on 1 February 1968 to contest the by-election for Holt's old House of Representatives seat of [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]] in south Melbourne.  The by-election in this comfortably safe Liberal seat was held on 24 February; there were three other candidates, but Gorton achieved a massive 68% of the formal vote.  He visited all the polling booths during the day, but was unable to vote for himself as he was still enrolled in [[Division of Mallee|Mallee]], in rural western Victoria.<ref>''the age(melbourne)magazine'', p. 16</ref> Between 2 and 23 February (both dates inclusive) he was a member of neither house of parliament.\n\n===Activities in office===\n[[File:John Gorton 1969.jpg|thumb|left|Gorton at the [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] during the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing in 1969]]\nGorton was initially a very popular Prime Minister. He carved out a style quite distinct from those of his predecessors \u2013 the aloof Menzies and the affable, sporty Holt. Gorton liked to portray himself as a man of the people who enjoyed a beer and a gamble, with a bit of a [[larrikinism|\"larrikin\"]] streak about him. Unfortunately for him, this reputation later came back to haunt him.\n\nHe also began to follow new policies, pursuing independent defence and foreign policies and distancing Australia from its traditional ties to Britain. But he continued to support Australia's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], a position he had reluctantly inherited from Holt, which became increasingly unpopular after 1968. On domestic issues, he favoured centralist policies at the expense of the states, which alienated powerful Liberal state leaders like Sir [[Henry Bolte]] of Victoria and [[Robert Askin|Bob Askin]] of New South Wales. He also fostered an independent [[Australian film industry]] and increased government funding for the arts.\nGorton proved to be a surprisingly poor media performer and public speaker, and was portrayed by the media as a foolish and incompetent administrator. He was unlucky to come up against a new and formidable Labor Opposition Leader in [[Gough Whitlam]]. Also, he was subjected to media speculation about his drinking habits and his involvements with women. He generated great resentment within his party, and his opponents became increasingly critical of his reliance on an inner circle of advisers \u2013 most notably his private secretary [[Ainsley Gotto]].\n\nThe Coalition suffered a 7% swing against it at the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 election]], and Labor outpolled it on the [[two-party-preferred vote]]. During the close election Gorton promised to waive all future government rent on residential leaseholders in Canberra.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=Yu-Hung|title=Myths and Realities of Public Land Leasing: Canberra and Hong Kong|journal=Land Lines|date=March 1999|volume=11|issue=2|url=https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/361_linc_landlines%203.99.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref> After surviving the election Gorton came through on his promise, giving away an estimated $100&nbsp;million in equity to leaseholders and abandoning future government rent revenue.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Karl|title=Canberra's Leasehold Land System|url=http://www.prosper.org.au/2008/01/16/canberra/|website=Prosper Australia|accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Still, Gorton saw the sizeable 45-seat majority he had inherited from Holt cut down to only seven.  Indeed, the Coalition might have lost government had it not been for the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]]'s longstanding practice of preferencing against the ALP.  The Coalition was only assured of a ninth term in government when DLP preferences tipped four marginal seats in Melbourne \u2014the DLP's heartland\u2014to the Liberals.  Had those preferences gone the other way, Whitlam would have become Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2007/results/senate/vic.htm Analysis of 2007 election in Victoria] by [[Antony Green]]</ref>\n\n===Leadership challenges and resignation===\n[[File:Gorton_and_McMahon.jpg|thumb|Gorton with [[William McMahon]] shortly after the unsuccessful leadership challenge in 1969.]]\nAfter the 1969 election, Gorton [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1969|was unsuccessfully challenged for the Liberal leadership]] by McMahon and National Development Minister [[David Fairbairn (politician)|David Fairbairn]]. With the Liberals falling further behind Labor in the polls in 1971, a challenge was launched in March when Defence Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] resigned.  Fraser had strongly supported Gorton for the leadership two years earlier, but now attacked Gorton on the floor of parliament in his resignation speech, saying that Gorton was \"not fit to hold the great office of Prime Minister.\"\n\nGorton called [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1971|a Liberal caucus meeting]] for 10 March 1971 to settle the matter. A motion of confidence in his leadership was tied. Under Liberal caucus rules of the time, a tied vote meant the motion was passed and hence Gorton could have remained as party leader and Prime Minister without further ado.  However, he took it upon himself to resign, saying \"Well, that is not a vote of confidence, so the party will have to elect a new leader.\"<ref>Neil Brown, ''On the Other Hand ... Sketches and Reflections from Political Life'', The Popular Press, 1993, p. 59</ref> A ballot was held and McMahon was elected leader and thus Prime Minister. Australian television marked the end of Gorton's stormy premiership with a newsreel montage accompanied by [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra's]] anthem \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\".\n\nIn a surprise move, Gorton contested and won the position of Deputy Leader, forcing McMahon to make him Defence Minister. This farcical situation ended within five months when McMahon sacked him for disloyalty.\n\n==Final years in parliament==\n[[File:President Nixon meeting with the Hon.Jack G Gorton - NARA - 194715.tif|thumb|left|Gorton meeting with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Alexander Haig]] in April 1971]]\nA number of polls during McMahon's prime ministership had Gorton as both the preferred Liberal leader and the preferred prime minister. In 1972, businessman [[David Hains]] commissioned a series of polls in marginal electorates that showed the Coalition would significantly increase its vote if Gorton mounted a successful comeback; for instance, polling in the [[Division of Henty]] found that his return would add eight points to the Liberal vote. However, Gorton generally downplayed the polling and did not mount an active campaign to oust McMahon.<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 362\u2013363.</ref> Labor went on to win a nine-seat majority at the [[1972 Australian federal election|1972 election]], ending 23 consecutive years of Coalition rule.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 364.</ref> A number of Gorton's contemporaries \u2013 including Country Party leader [[Doug Anthony]] and Labor ministers [[Clyde Cameron]], [[Doug McClelland]], and [[John Wheeldon]] \u2013 retrospectively expressed doubts as to whether Whitlam could have won if Gorton had returned to the prime ministership. [[Rupert Murdoch]], whose newspapers endorsed the Labor Party, stated in 2000 that \"we would most certainly have supported the re-election of a Gorton Government in 1972. And he would have won!\".<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 365.</ref>\n\nMcMahon resigned as Liberal leader a few weeks after the 1972 election. Gorton was one of five candidates who stood [[1972 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|the resulting leadership ballot]], but polled only the fourth-highest total as [[Billy Snedden]] won a narrow victory over [[Nigel Bowen]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110626409|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=21 December 1972|title=Snedden faces his first problems}}</ref> Snedden subsequently appointed him to the opposition frontbench as spokesman for urban and regional development, the environment, and conservation.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=30 January 1973|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110704896|title=Snedden names 'Shadow' team}}</ref> Soon after being sworn in as prime minister, Whitlam responded to a congratulatory letter from Gorton by promising to \"advance some of the causes which you were the first Australian Prime Minister to identify\". Over the following years, several failed initiatives from Gorton's prime ministership were passed into law by the [[Whitlam Government]]. This included the establishment of the [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]] and the assertion of sovereignty over the territorial seabed and continental shelf.<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 366\u2013367.</ref>\n\n===Social liberalism===\nEarly in 1973, Gorton stated his public support of \"abortion on request, under certain conditions\"; he was opposed to \"compulsory pregnancy\". He nonetheless voted against [[David McKenzie (Victorian politician)|David McKenzie]] and [[Tony Lamb]]'s private member's bill to legalise abortion in the Australian Capital Territory, as he believed it did not provide clear enough guidelines for medical practitioners. He preferred the conditions of the [[Menhennitt ruling]].<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 367\u2013368.</ref> Gorton was also a supporter of no-fault divorce. During the debate over what became the ''[[Family Law Act 1975]]'', he [[cross the floor|crossed the floor]] to oppose a Coalition amendment which he thought complicated the requirements for divorce through separation.<ref name=p377>Hancock (2002), p. 377.</ref>\n\nIn October 1973, Gorton introduced a motion in the House of Representatives calling for the [[LGBT rights in Australia|decriminalisation of homosexuality]], co-sponsored by Labor's [[Moss Cass]]. It was modelled on the recommendations of the UK's [[Wolfenden report]]. While noting his personal objections to homosexuality, Gorton stated that most gay people \"hurt no one, harm no one and yet have this hanging over them\". He dismissed arguments that decriminalisation would violate \"God's law\", noting that many religious leaders were in favour of a change, and stated that the existing law had led to \"[[Gay bashing|bashing]]\", blackmail, and suicides. The motion passed by 24 votes, with all parties receiving a [[conscience vote]]. However, it was of no legal effect as homosexuality law was the province of state laws and territory ordinances.<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 368\u2013369.</ref><ref>[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/genpdf/hansard80/hansardr80/1973-10-18/0029/hansard_frag.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HOMOSEXUALITY SPEECH], Hansard, 18 October 1973.</ref>\n\n===Resignation from the Liberal Party===\nGorton was re-elected at the [[1974 Australian federal election|1974 election]] with an increased majority.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 371.</ref> He was dropped from shadow cabinet after the election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110783471|title=Old line-up changed|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=15 June 1974}}</ref> In November 1974, following an unsuccessful attempt to install [[Malcolm Fraser]] as Liberal leader, he condemned those involved and stated they had caused \"irreparable damage\" to the party.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 374.</ref> On 3 March 1975, as leadership tensions continued to build, Gorton announced that he would not recontest his seat in parliament at the next election, citing his unwillingness to be a perpetual backbencher. He also stated: \"If Fraser got in, it would be a disaster. He is extreme right-wing. The Liberal Party can't be a right-leaning affair.\"<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 376.</ref> When Fraser won [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1975|a leadership spill]] on 21 March, Gorton reportedly stormed out of the meeting and slammed the door behind him.<ref name=p377/>\n\nOn 23 May 1975, Gorton announced his resignation from the Liberal Party and his intention to be an independent candidate for one of the new [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) Senate seats. He hoped to join [[Steele Hall]] on the [[crossbench]] and secure the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]].<ref name=p377/> Opinion polling shortly after his announcement showed him winning 55 percent of the primary vote.

It was the second-highest percentage for an independent candidate nation-wide, after [[Brian Harradine]]'s 12.8 percent in Tasmania, but nowhere near enough to win election. He had campaigned mainly on local issues, which obscured his candidacy somewhat in an election that was a virtual referendum on the Whitlam Government.<ref>Hancock (2002), p. 381.</ref>\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Grave_of_John_Gorton,_Melbourne_General_Cemetery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grave of Sir John within the 'Prime Ministers Garden' at [[Melbourne General Cemetery]]]]\nGorton retired to [[Canberra]], where he largely kept out of the political limelight. However, in March 1983, he congratulated [[Bob Hawke]] \"for rolling that bastard Fraser\" at [[1983 Australian federal election|that year's election]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Macinnis|first=Peter|title=The Big Book of Australian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfGLAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=National Library Australia|isbn=978-0-642-27832-6|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=VfGLAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA221 221]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Gorton was recruited to record a series of three-minute radio broadcasts on current affairs, titled \"Sir John Gorton's viewpoints\". He wrote and recorded around 400 segments over the following four years, which were syndicated and broadcast by over 80 radio stations around the country. His broadcasts covered a wide range of issues \u2013 he supported the decriminalisation of marijuana and prostitution, called on Australians to welcome [[Vietnamese boat people]], opposed the creation of [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], denounced \"the cacophony known as modern music\", opposed Aboriginal land rights, supported uranium mining, and opposed [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]]. He frequently criticised the [[Fraser Government]], but grudgingly admired Fraser's ability to get his way as prime minister.<ref>Hancock (2002), pp. 384\u2013389.</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, Gorton quietly rejoined the Liberal Party; [[John Hewson]] credited himself with \"returning Gorton to the fold.\"<ref>ABC TV \"Midday Report\", Interview w.

She was a language student at the [[Sorbonne]]. This meeting came about through Gorton's friend from Oxford, Arthur Brown, who was Bettina's brother. In 1935, Gorton and Bettina Brown were married in Oxford. After his studies were finished, they settled in Australia, taking over his father's orchard, \"Mystic Park\", at [[Lake Kangaroo, Victoria|Lake Kangaroo]] near [[Kerang]], Victoria. They had three children: Joanna, Michael and Robin. Gorton's first wife died of cancer in 1983. In 1993, he remarried to Nancy Home (n\u00e9e Elliott) a long-time acquaintance.<ref name=naabg>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/spouse.aspx|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|title=Bettina Gorton|accessdate=24 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315145301/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/gorton/spouse.aspx|archive-date=15 March 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nGorton was a nominal Christian at least in the early part of his life, but was not a churchgoer. Some sources have identified him as agnostic or even atheist. He attended Anglican schools, and was influenced by the [[Christian socialist]] views of [[James Ralph Darling]], his headmaster at [[Geelong Grammar]].<ref>Williams, Roy (2013). ''In God They Trust?'', Bible Society Australia, p. 149.</ref> In a 1948 speech, Gorton said that \"the story of Christianity is the most tremendous in the history of the world\".<ref>Williams: 151.</ref> However, in the lead-up to the [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]] he publicly opposed mentioning God in the preamble. According to his biographer Ian Hancock: \"Gorton may not have been a believing, let alone a practising, Christian, and when he spoke of religion of 'the soul' he did not have a particular faith in mind. Rather, his religion was founded upon the injunction in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]: 'Man doth not live by bread only'.\"<ref>Hancock: 107</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n[[File:John Gorton bust.jpg|thumb|Bust
