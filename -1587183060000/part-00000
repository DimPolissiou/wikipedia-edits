ULIS also has a large number of exchanges with various other universities around the world and offers Vietnamese language studies for visiting exchange students.  ULIS was originally known as the School of Foreign Languages until the 1950s. In 1958, the School of Foreign Languages was merged into Hanoi University of Education, forming its Faculty of Foreign Languages. As one of the three first members of Vietnam National University, Hanoi University of Foreign Language Education since 1993 has been widely known as the University of Languages and International Studies \u2013 Vietnam National University, Hanoi (ULIS - VNU). Its international and national staff has enlarged since 2012 and now includes lecturers from many countries including Japan, Russia, France, Germany, Taiwan, Korea, and the United States.<ref>http://ulis.vnu.edu.vn/english/</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, '''VNU-ULIS''' offers bachelor's degrees in Translation, Interpreting, and Teacher Education in English, Japanese, Korean, German, Russian, French, Chinese, and Arabic. Students can also join a double major program with many of VNU other universities such as 'International Business' or 'English-Finance and Banking', and 'Economics and Business' just to name a few.\n\nGraduate programs are offered in English linguistics, as well as French, Japanese, Chinese, and Russian Linguistics. There are also graduate courses where students can receive a masters in Theory and Methodology in Teaching, either for English, French, Russian, or Chinese. Master's degree level courses in English are also offered with a partnership program with Walkato University in New Zealand.  Doctorates are offered in English Linguistics, Russian Linguistics, and French.\n\n'''VNU-ULIS''' enjoys close international connections with '''Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, and Japan'''. Staff and student exchange programs have been successful like the KOICA and the Korean Foundation. ULIS has expanded cooperation with a variety of Korean institutions including the University of Seoul, Yonsei, Chunggang, Kookmin, Kyunghee, Hansung, and Inha. ULIS students studying ''Korean'' receive valuable scholarships from Korean corporations such as Lotte, Kumho, Samsung, Daewoo, Miwon, Keb, LG, Posco, Booyang, Sellex and others.\n\nMany partnerships have been set up through the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] Foundation as well. The Japanese Foundation is an arm of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has been active with ULIS with special guests and lectures, student trips, and short training courses in Japan.  Other connections with Japan include University of Kumamoto Gakuen (considered a sister university to ULIS),  Daiaku, Nagaoka, Tokyo Foreign Language University, as well as several agreements with various business firms from Japan.  VNU-ULIS was the first institution in Vietnam to offer degrees in Japanese Language Teacher Education.\n\n'''VNU-ULIS''' is the only institution in Vietnam to have a bachelor program in German language teacher education.<ref>ULIS Magazine, Spring, 2013. pg3. \"ULIS Strengthens Connections with Germany\"</ref>\n\nThe joint ULIS-[[Southern New Hampshire University]] (USA) English program is one of the programs as is their intensive English studies program.

Students can also spend two years at the ULIS campus and then another two years in China and receive degree credit from Shanxi Normal University, Huadong Normal University.\n\nBesides the various programs and international agreements, several training and research centers follow under the ULIS umbrella organization. These include the Centre for Foreign Language Education Research and Quality Assurance, Centre for Research and Application of Information Technology in Teaching and Learning Foreign Languages, Centre for Distance Training and Teacher Development, and the Centre for International Education. The university also has close ties with the Foreign Languages Specializing School (FLSS). This school, established in 1969 and affiliated under the ULIS administration, is considered to be one of the best high schools for foreign language study in Vietnam.

After some years of work on educational field of Uzbekistan the \"Uzbekistan State University of World Languages\" was reopened as the fully operating institute and was recognized under the \"Ministry of Secondary-specialized and higher education of Uzbekistan\" and currently involved with training of specialists which are recognized worldwide.\nThe diploma which is obtained at the \"Uzbekistan State University of World Languages\" is considered to be as the approval of higher education graduation in Uzbekistan and in some other international countries. \"Uzbekistan State University of World Languages\" is fully supplied with the licenses by the \"Ministry of Secondary-specialized and higher education of Uzbekistan\" which means that the institute can fully operate in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Nowadays, it is estimated that there are more than 5000 students who are currently involved with the studies at the institute, who study for their bachelor's degrees. The studies at the \"Uzbekistan State University of World Languages\" are held in two types, which is set by the government of Uzbekistan. The first type of studies at the institute is set to be the studies on the contract basis. All the tuition fees are set by the standards of Uzbek government, and every student studying on the contract basis at the institute must pay the fee on time. The second type of the studies at the \"Uzbekistan State University of World Languages\" is set to be the studies on the grant basis. All the talented students are awarded by the sponsors of the institute with the grants, which allow the students to study for free. The length of studies at the institute is set to be 4 years for obtaining the bachelor's degree, and 2 years for gaining the master's degree. The teaching staff of the institute is estimated to be more than 500 professional teachers, and most of them are considered to be the professors on their related subjects. The study programs and textbooks are provided for the students, according to the higher educational standards of Republic of Uzbekistan and the study process is patrolled by the \"Ministry of Secondary-specialized and higher education of Uzbekistan\".
