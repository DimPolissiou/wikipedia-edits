Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled \"training\" data ([[supervised learning]]), but when no [[labeled data]] are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns ([[unsupervised learning]]). [[Machine learning]] is strongly related to pattern recognition and originates from [[artificial intelligence]]. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and [[Signal Processing]] into consideration. It originated in [[engineering]], and the term is popular in the context of [[computer vision]]: a leading computer vision conference is named [[Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]]. In pattern recognition, there may be a higher interest to formalize, explain and visualize the pattern, while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates. Yet, all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence, engineering and statistics, and they've become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other.\n\nIn [[machine learning]], pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, [[Linear discriminant analysis|discriminant analysis]] was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of ''classes'' (for example, determine whether a given email is \"spam\" or \"non-spam\"). However, pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are [[regression analysis|regression]], which assigns a [[real number|real-valued]] output to each input;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=W.R.|date=2007-02-20|title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning20072Christopher M.

This is opposed to ''[[pattern matching]]'' algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is [[regular expression]] matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s. In contrast to pattern recognition, pattern matching is not generally a type of machine learning, although pattern-matching algorithms (especially with fairly general, carefully tailored patterns) can sometimes succeed in providing similar-quality output of the sort provided by pattern-recognition algorithms.\n\n==Overview==\nPattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value. ''[[Supervised learning]]'' assumes that a set of ''training data'' (the ''[[training set]]'') has been provided, consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output. A learning procedure then generates a ''model'' that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives: Perform as well as possible on the training data, and generalize as well as possible to new data (usually, this means being as simple as possible, for some technical definition of \"simple\", in accordance with [[Occam's Razor]], discussed below). [[Unsupervised learning]], on the other hand, assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled, and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances.<ref>{{Cite journal| author= Carvalko, J.R., Preston K. | year=1972 |title= On Determining Optimum Simple Golay Marking Transforms for Binary Image Processing | journal= IEEE Transactions on Computers  | volume=21 | issue=12 | pages=1430\u201333  | doi = 10.1109/T-C.1972.223519}}.</ref> A combination of the two that has recently been explored is [[semi-supervised learning]], which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data). Note that in cases of unsupervised learning, there may be no training data at all to speak of; in other words,and the data to be labeled ''is'' the training data.\n\nNote that sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output. For example, the unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as ''[[data clustering|clustering]]'', based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of, and of grouping the input data into ''clusters'' based on some inherent [[similarity measure]] (e.g. the [[distance]] between instances, considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional [[vector space]]), rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of pre-defined classes. In some fields, the terminology is different: For example, in [[community ecology]], the term \"classification\" is used to refer to what is commonly known as \"clustering\".\n\nThe piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an ''instance''. The instance is formally described by a [[feature vector|vector]] of ''features'', which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance. (These feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate [[space (mathematics)|multidimensional space]], and methods for manipulating vectors in [[vector space]]s can be correspondingly applied to them, such as computing the [[dot product]] or the angle between two vectors.) Typically, features are either [[categorical data|categorical]] (also known as [[nominal data|nominal]], i.e., consisting of one of a set of unordered items, such as a gender of \"male\" or \"female\", or a blood type of \"A\", \"B\", \"AB\" or \"O\"), [[ordinal data|ordinal]] (consisting of one of a set of ordered items, e.g., \"large\", \"medium\" or \"small\"), [[integer|integer-valued]] (e.g., a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or [[real number|real-valued]] (e.g., a measurement of blood pressure). Often, categorical and ordinal data are grouped together; likewise for integer-valued and real-valued data. Furthermore, many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that real-valued or integer-valued data be ''discretized'' into groups (e.g., less than 5, between 5 and 10, or greater than 10).\n\n===Probabilistic classifiers===\n{{main|Probabilistic classifier}}\nMany common pattern recognition algorithms are ''probabilistic'' in nature, in that they use [[statistical inference]] to find the best label for a given instance. Unlike other algorithms, which simply output a \"best\" label, often probabilistic algorithms also output a [[probability]] of the instance being described by the given label. In addition, many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the ''N''-best labels with associated probabilities, for some value of ''N'', instead of simply a single best label. When the number of possible labels is fairly small (e.g., in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]]), ''N'' may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output. Probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:\n*They output a confidence value associated with their choice. (Note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values, but in general, only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in [[probability theory]]. Non-probabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning, and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm.)\n*Correspondingly, they can ''abstain'' when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low.\n*Because of the probabilities output, probabilistic pattern-recognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machine-learning tasks, in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of ''error propagation''.\n\n===Number of important feature variables===\n[[Feature selection]] algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features. A general introduction to [[feature selection]] which summarizes approaches and challenges, has been given.<ref>Isabelle Guyon Clopinet, Andr\u00e9 Elisseeff (2003).

For example, [[feature extraction]] algorithms attempt to reduce a large-dimensionality feature vector into a smaller-dimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy, using mathematical techniques such as [[principal components analysis]] (PCA). The distinction between '''feature selection''' and '''feature extraction''' is that the resulting features after feature extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original features and may not easily be interpretable, while the features left after feature selection are simply a subset of the original features.\n\n== Problem statement (supervised version)==\nFormally, the problem of [[supervised learning|supervised]] pattern recognition can be stated as follows: Given an unknown function <math>g:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> (the ''ground truth'') that maps input instances <math>\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}</math> to output labels <math>y \\in \\mathcal{Y}</math>, along with training data <math>\\mathbf{D} = \\{(\\boldsymbol{x}_1,y_1),\\dots,(\\boldsymbol{x}_n, y_n)\\}</math> assumed to represent accurate examples of the mapping, produce a function <math>h:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> that approximates as closely as possible the correct mapping <math>g</math>. (For example, if the problem is filtering spam, then <math>\\boldsymbol{x}_i</math> is some representation of an email and <math>y</math> is either \"spam\" or \"non-spam\"). In order for this to be a well-defined problem, \"approximates as closely as possible\" needs to be defined rigorously. In [[decision theory]], this is defined by specifying a [[loss function]] or cost function that assigns a specific value to \"loss\" resulting from producing an incorrect label. The goal then is to minimize the [[expected value|expected]] loss, with the expectation taken over the [[probability distribution]] of <math>\\mathcal{X}</math>. In practice, neither the distribution of <math>\\mathcal{X}</math> nor the ground truth function <math>g:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> are known exactly, but can be computed only empirically by collecting a large number of samples of <math>\\mathcal{X}</math> and hand-labeling them using the correct value of <math>\\mathcal{Y}</math> (a time-consuming process, which is typically the limiting factor in the amount of data of this sort that can be collected). The particular loss function depends on the type of label being predicted. For example, in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], the simple [[zero-one loss function]] is often sufficient. This corresponds simply to assigning a loss of 1 to any incorrect labeling and implies that the optimal classifier minimizes the [[Bayes error rate|error rate]] on independent test data (i.e. counting up the fraction of instances that the learned function <math>h:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> labels wrongly, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of correctly classified instances). The goal of the learning procedure is then to minimize the error rate (maximize the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]) on a \"typical\" test set.\n\nFor a probabilistic pattern recognizer, the problem is instead to estimate the probability of each possible output label given a particular input instance, i.e., to estimate a function of the form\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta) = f\\left(\\boldsymbol{x};\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)</math>\nwhere the [[feature vector]] input is <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math>, and the function ''f'' is typically parameterized by some parameters <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}</math>.<ref>For [[linear discriminant analysis]] the parameter vector <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math> consists of the two mean vectors <math>\\boldsymbol\\mu_1</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol\\mu_2</math> and the common [[covariance matrix]] <math>\\boldsymbol\\Sigma</math>.</ref> In a [[discriminative model|discriminative]] approach to the problem, ''f'' is estimated directly. In a [[generative model|generative]] approach, however, the inverse probability <math>p({\\boldsymbol{x}|\\rm label})</math> is instead estimated and combined with the [[prior probability]] <math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> using [[Bayes' rule]], as follows:\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta) = \\frac{p({\\boldsymbol{x}|\\rm label,\\boldsymbol\\theta}) p({\\rm label|\\boldsymbol\\theta})}{\\sum_{L \\in \\text{all labels}} p(\\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\\boldsymbol\\theta)}.</math>\n\nWhen the labels are [[continuous distribution|continuously distributed]] (e.g., in [[regression analysis]]), the denominator involves [[integral|integration]] rather than summation:\n\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta) = \\frac{p({\\boldsymbol{x}|\\rm label,\\boldsymbol\\theta}) p({\\rm label|\\boldsymbol\\theta})}{\\int_{L \\in \\text{all labels}} p(\\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\\boldsymbol\\theta) \\operatorname{d}L}.</math>\n\nThe value of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math> is typically learned using [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation. This finds the best value that simultaneously meets two conflicting objects: To perform as well as possible on the training data (smallest [[Bayes error rate|error-rate]]) and to find the simplest possible model. Essentially, this combines [[maximum likelihood]] estimation with a [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models. In a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] context, the regularization procedure can be viewed as placing a [[prior probability]] <math>p(\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> on different values of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math>. Mathematically:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\theta^* = \\arg \\max_{\\boldsymbol\\theta} p(\\boldsymbol\\theta|\\mathbf{D})</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta^*</math> is the value used for <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math> in the subsequent evaluation procedure, and <math>p(\\boldsymbol\\theta|\\mathbf{D})</math>, the [[posterior probability]] of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math>, is given by\n\n:<math>p(\\boldsymbol\\theta|\\mathbf{D}) = \\left[\\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i|\\boldsymbol{x}_i,\\boldsymbol\\theta) \\right] p(\\boldsymbol\\theta).</math>\n\nIn the [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] approach to this problem, instead of choosing a single parameter vector <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*</math>, the probability of a given label for a new instance <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math> is computed by integrating over all possible values of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math>, weighted according to the posterior probability:\n\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\int p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta)p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{D}) \\operatorname{d}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}.</math>\n\n=== Frequentist or Bayesian approach to pattern recognition ===\nThe first pattern classifier \u2013 the linear discriminant presented by [[Fisher discriminant analysis|Fisher]] \u2013 was developed in the [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]] tradition. The frequentist approach entails that the model parameters are considered unknown, but objective. The parameters are then computed (estimated) from the collected data. For the linear discriminant, these parameters are precisely the mean vectors and the [[covariance matrix]]. Also the probability of each class <math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> is estimated from the collected dataset. Note that the usage of '[[Bayes rule]]' in a pattern classifier does not make the classification approach Bayesian.\n\n[[Bayesian inference|Bayesian statistics]] has its origin in Greek philosophy where a distinction was already made between the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' and the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]' knowledge. Later [[A priori and a posteriori#Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined his distinction between what is a priori known \u2013 before observation \u2013 and the empirical knowledge gained from observations. In a Bayesian pattern classifier, the class probabilities <math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> can be chosen by the user, which are then a priori. Moreover, experience quantified as a priori parameter values can be weighted with empirical observations \u2013 using e.g., the [[Beta distribution|Beta-]] ([[Conjugate prior distribution|conjugate prior]]) and [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet-distributions]]. The Bayesian approach facilitates a seamless intermixing between expert knowledge in the form of subjective probabilities, and objective observations.\n\nProbabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a Bayesian approach.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:800px-Cool Kids of Death Off Festival p 146-face selected.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Face recognition|The face was automatically detected]] by special software.]]\nWithin medical science, pattern recognition is the basis for [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) systems.

Pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways: the first being template matching and the second being feature detection. \nA template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions. The template-matching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long term memory. If there is a match, the stimulus is identified.\nFeature detection models, such as the Pandemonium system for classifying letters (Selfridge, 1959), suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification.

Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled \"training\" data ([[supervised learning]]), but when no [[labeled data]] are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns ([[unsupervised learning]]). [[Machine learning]] is strongly related to pattern recognition and originates from [[artificial intelligence]]. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and [[Signal Processing]] into consideration. It originated in [[engineering]], and the term is popular in the context of [[computer vision]]: a leading computer vision conference is named [[Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]]. In pattern recognition, there may be a higher interest to formalize, explain and visualize the pattern, while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates. Yet, all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence, engineering and statistics, and they've become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other.\n\nIn [[machine learning]], pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, [[Linear discriminant analysis|discriminant analysis]] was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of ''classes'' (for example, determine whether a given email is \"spam\" or \"non-spam\"). However, pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are [[regression analysis|regression]], which assigns a [[real number|real-valued]] output to each input;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=W.R.|date=2007-02-20|title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning20072Christopher M.

This is opposed to ''[[pattern matching]]'' algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is [[regular expression]] matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s. In contrast to pattern recognition, pattern matching is not generally a type of machine learning, although pattern-matching algorithms (especially with fairly general, carefully tailored patterns) can sometimes succeed in providing similar-quality output of the sort provided by pattern-recognition algorithms.\n\n==Overview==\nPattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value. ''[[Supervised learning]]'' assumes that a set of ''training data'' (the ''[[training set]]'') has been provided, consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output. A learning procedure then generates a ''model'' that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives: Perform as well as possible on the training data, and generalize as well as possible to new data (usually, this means being as simple as possible, for some technical definition of \"simple\", in accordance with [[Occam's Razor]], discussed below). [[Unsupervised learning]], on the other hand, assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled, and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances.<ref>{{Cite journal| author= Carvalko, J.R., Preston K. | year=1972 |title= On Determining Optimum Simple Golay Marking Transforms for Binary Image Processing | journal= IEEE Transactions on Computers  | volume=21 | issue=12 | pages=1430\u201333  | doi = 10.1109/T-C.1972.223519}}.</ref> A combination of the two that has recently been explored is [[semi-supervised learning]], which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data). Note that in cases of unsupervised learning, there may be no training data at all to speak of; in other words,and the data to be labeled ''is'' the training data.\n\nNote that sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output. For example, the unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as ''[[data clustering|clustering]]'', based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of, and of grouping the input data into ''clusters'' based on some inherent [[similarity measure]] (e.g. the [[distance]] between instances, considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional [[vector space]]), rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of pre-defined classes. In some fields, the terminology is different: For example, in [[community ecology]], the term \"classification\" is used to refer to what is commonly known as \"clustering\".\n\nThe piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an ''instance''. The instance is formally described by a [[feature vector|vector]] of ''features'', which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance. (These feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate [[space (mathematics)|multidimensional space]], and methods for manipulating vectors in [[vector space]]s can be correspondingly applied to them, such as computing the [[dot product]] or the angle between two vectors.) Typically, features are either [[categorical data|categorical]] (also known as [[nominal data|nominal]], i.e., consisting of one of a set of unordered items, such as a gender of \"male\" or \"female\", or a blood type of \"A\", \"B\", \"AB\" or \"O\"), [[ordinal data|ordinal]] (consisting of one of a set of ordered items, e.g., \"large\", \"medium\" or \"small\"), [[integer|integer-valued]] (e.g., a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or [[real number|real-valued]] (e.g., a measurement of blood pressure). Often, categorical and ordinal data are grouped together; likewise for integer-valued and real-valued data. Furthermore, many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that real-valued or integer-valued data be ''discretized'' into groups (e.g., less than 5, between 5 and 10, or greater than 10).\n\n===Probabilistic classifiers===\n{{main|Probabilistic classifier}}\nMany common pattern recognition algorithms are ''probabilistic'' in nature, in that they use [[statistical inference]] to find the best label for a given instance. Unlike other algorithms, which simply output a \"best\" label, often probabilistic algorithms also output a [[probability]] of the instance being described by the given label. In addition, many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the ''N''-best labels with associated probabilities, for some value of ''N'', instead of simply a single best label. When the number of possible labels is fairly small (e.g., in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]]), ''N'' may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output. Probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:\n*They output a confidence value associated with their choice. (Note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values, but in general, only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in [[probability theory]]. Non-probabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning, and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm.)\n*Correspondingly, they can ''abstain'' when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low.\n*Because of the probabilities output, probabilistic pattern-recognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machine-learning tasks, in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of ''error propagation''.\n\n===Number of important feature variables===\n[[Feature selection]] algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features. A general introduction to [[feature selection]] which summarizes approaches and challenges, has been given.<ref>Isabelle Guyon Clopinet, Andr\u00e9 Elisseeff (2003).

[http://www-vis.lbl.gov/~romano/mlgroup/papers/guyon03a.pdf Link]</ref> The complexity of feature-selection is, because of its non-monotonous character, an [[optimization problem]] where given a total of <math>n</math> features the [[powerset]] consisting of all <math>2^n-1</math> subsets of features need to be explored.

For example, [[feature extraction]] algorithms attempt to reduce a large-dimensionality feature vector into a smaller-dimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy, using mathematical techniques such as [[principal components analysis]] (PCA). The distinction between '''feature selection''' and '''feature extraction''' is that the resulting features after feature extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original features and may not easily be interpretable, while the features left after feature selection are simply a subset of the original features.\n\n== Problem statement (supervised version)==\nFormally, the problem of [[supervised learning|supervised]] pattern recognition can be stated as follows: Given an unknown function <math>g:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> (the ''ground truth'') that maps input instances <math>\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}</math> to output labels <math>y \\in \\mathcal{Y}</math>, along with training data <math>\\mathbf{D} = \\{(\\boldsymbol{x}_1,y_1),\\dots,(\\boldsymbol{x}_n, y_n)\\}</math> assumed to represent accurate examples of the mapping, produce a function <math>h:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> that approximates as closely as possible the correct mapping <math>g</math>. (For example, if the problem is filtering spam, then <math>\\boldsymbol{x}_i</math> is some representation of an email and <math>y</math> is either \"spam\" or \"non-spam\"). In order for this to be a well-defined problem, \"approximates as closely as possible\" needs to be defined rigorously. In [[decision theory]], this is defined by specifying a [[loss function]] or cost function that assigns a specific value to \"loss\" resulting from producing an incorrect label. The goal then is to minimize the [[expected value|expected]] loss, with the expectation taken over the [[probability distribution]] of <math>\\mathcal{X}</math>. In practice, neither the distribution of <math>\\mathcal{X}</math> nor the ground truth function <math>g:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> are known exactly, but can be computed only empirically by collecting a large number of samples of <math>\\mathcal{X}</math> and hand-labeling them using the correct value of <math>\\mathcal{Y}</math> (a time-consuming process, which is typically the limiting factor in the amount of data of this sort that can be collected). The particular loss function depends on the type of label being predicted. For example, in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], the simple [[zero-one loss function]] is often sufficient. This corresponds simply to assigning a loss of 1 to any incorrect labeling and implies that the optimal classifier minimizes the [[Bayes error rate|error rate]] on independent test data (i.e. counting up the fraction of instances that the learned function <math>h:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}</math> labels wrongly, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of correctly classified instances). The goal of the learning procedure is then to minimize the error rate (maximize the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]) on a \"typical\" test set.\n\nFor a probabilistic pattern recognizer, the problem is instead to estimate the probability of each possible output label given a particular input instance, i.e., to estimate a function of the form\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta) = f\\left(\\boldsymbol{x};\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)</math>\nwhere the [[feature vector]] input is <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math>, and the function ''f'' is typically parameterized by some parameters <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}</math>.<ref>For [[linear discriminant analysis]] the parameter vector <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math> consists of the two mean vectors <math>\\boldsymbol\\mu_1</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol\\mu_2</math> and the common [[covariance matrix]] <math>\\boldsymbol\\Sigma</math>.</ref> In a [[discriminative model|discriminative]] approach to the problem, ''f'' is estimated directly. In a [[generative model|generative]] approach, however, the inverse probability <math>p({\\boldsymbol{x}|\\rm label})</math> is instead estimated and combined with the [[prior probability]] <math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> using [[Bayes' rule]], as follows:\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta) = \\frac{p({\\boldsymbol{x}|\\rm label,\\boldsymbol\\theta}) p({\\rm label|\\boldsymbol\\theta})}{\\sum_{L \\in \\text{all labels}} p(\\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\\boldsymbol\\theta)}.</math>\n\nWhen the labels are [[continuous distribution|continuously distributed]] (e.g., in [[regression analysis]]), the denominator involves [[integral|integration]] rather than summation:\n\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta) = \\frac{p({\\boldsymbol{x}|\\rm label,\\boldsymbol\\theta}) p({\\rm label|\\boldsymbol\\theta})}{\\int_{L \\in \\text{all labels}} p(\\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\\boldsymbol\\theta) \\operatorname{d}L}.</math>\n\nThe value of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math> is typically learned using [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation. This finds the best value that simultaneously meets two conflicting objects: To perform as well as possible on the training data (smallest [[Bayes error rate|error-rate]]) and to find the simplest possible model. Essentially, this combines [[maximum likelihood]] estimation with a [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models. In a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] context, the regularization procedure can be viewed as placing a [[prior probability]] <math>p(\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> on different values of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math>. Mathematically:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\theta^* = \\arg \\max_{\\boldsymbol\\theta} p(\\boldsymbol\\theta|\\mathbf{D})</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta^*</math> is the value used for <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math> in the subsequent evaluation procedure, and <math>p(\\boldsymbol\\theta|\\mathbf{D})</math>, the [[posterior probability]] of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math>, is given by\n\n:<math>p(\\boldsymbol\\theta|\\mathbf{D}) = \\left[\\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i|\\boldsymbol{x}_i,\\boldsymbol\\theta) \\right] p(\\boldsymbol\\theta).</math>\n\nIn the [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] approach to this problem, instead of choosing a single parameter vector <math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*</math>, the probability of a given label for a new instance <math>\\boldsymbol{x}</math> is computed by integrating over all possible values of <math>\\boldsymbol\\theta</math>, weighted according to the posterior probability:\n\n:<math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\int p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol\\theta)p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{D}) \\operatorname{d}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}.</math>\n\n=== Frequentist or Bayesian approach to pattern recognition ===\nThe first pattern classifier \u2013 the linear discriminant presented by [[Fisher discriminant analysis|Fisher]] \u2013 was developed in the [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]] tradition. The frequentist approach entails that the model parameters are considered unknown, but objective. The parameters are then computed (estimated) from the collected data. For the linear discriminant, these parameters are precisely the mean vectors and the [[covariance matrix]]. Also the probability of each class <math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> is estimated from the collected dataset. Note that the usage of '[[Bayes rule]]' in a pattern classifier does not make the classification approach Bayesian.\n\n[[Bayesian inference|Bayesian statistics]] has its origin in Greek philosophy where a distinction was already made between the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' and the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]' knowledge. Later [[A priori and a posteriori#Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined his distinction between what is a priori known \u2013 before observation \u2013 and the empirical knowledge gained from observations. In a Bayesian pattern classifier, the class probabilities <math>p({\\rm label}|\\boldsymbol\\theta)</math> can be chosen by the user, which are then a priori. Moreover, experience quantified as a priori parameter values can be weighted with empirical observations \u2013 using e.g., the [[Beta distribution|Beta-]] ([[Conjugate prior distribution|conjugate prior]]) and [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet-distributions]]. The Bayesian approach facilitates a seamless intermixing between expert knowledge in the form of subjective probabilities, and objective observations.\n\nProbabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a Bayesian approach.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:800px-Cool Kids of Death Off Festival p 146-face selected.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Face recognition|The face was automatically detected]] by special software.]]\nWithin medical science, pattern recognition is the basis for [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) systems.

Pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways: the first being template matching and the second being feature detection. \nA template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions. The template-matching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long term memory. If there is a match, the stimulus is identified.\nFeature detection models, such as the Pandemonium system for classifying letters (Selfridge, 1959), suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification. For example, a capital E has three horizontal lines and one vertical line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/psychology/attention/revise-it/pattern-recognition |title=A-level Psychology Attention Revision - Pattern recognition &#124; S-cool, the revision website |publisher=S-cool.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\nAlgorithms for pattern recognition depend on the type of label output, on whether learning is supervised or unsupervised, and on whether the algorithm is statistical or non-statistical in nature.

The plan involved enlarging the passenger terminus and plane taxiways. It also planned to add parking for 3,000 more cars, much of it on greenbelt land. North Somerset council voted to reject the plan. It said the detrimental effect on the area and the wider impact on the environment outweighed the narrower benefits to airport expansion. However the airport could lodge an appeal, which would be heard at a public inquiry.<ref>{{Cite

Columbus is home to museums and tourism sites, including the [[National Infantry Museum]], dedicated to the [[United States Army]]'s [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry Branch]]. It has the longest urban [[whitewater]] [[rafting]] course in the world constructed on the Chattahoochee River.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Columbus, Georgia}}\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Downtown columbus, georgia 1880.jpg|left|thumb|[[Downtown Columbus, Georgia|Downtown]] in 1880]]\nThis was for centuries and more the traditional territory of the [[Creek (people)|Creek Indians]], who became known as one of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the Southeast after European contact. Those who lived closest to white-occupied areas conducted considerable trading and adopted some European-American ways.\n\nFounded in 1828 by an act of the Georgia Legislature, Columbus was situated at the beginning of the navigable portion of the Chattahoochee River and on the last stretch of the [[Federal Road (Creek lands)|Federal Road]] before entering Alabama. The city was named for [[Christopher Columbus]]. The plan for the city was drawn up by Dr. Edwin L. DeGraffenried, who placed the town on a bluff overlooking the river. Across the river to the west, where Phenix City, Alabama, is now located, Creeks still lived until they were forcibly [[Indian Removal|removed]] in 1836 by the federal government to make way for European-American settlers.\n\nThe river served as Columbus's connection to the world, particularly enabling it to ship its commodity cotton crops from the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s to the international cotton market via [[New Orleans]] and ultimately [[Liverpool]], England. The city's [[commerce|commercial]] importance increased in the 1850s with the arrival of the railroad. In addition, [[textile]] mills were developed along the river, bringing industry to an area reliant upon agriculture. By 1860, the city was one of the more important industrial centers of the South, earning it the nickname \"the [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] of the South\", referring to an important textile mill town in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Manganiello|first1=Christopher J.|title=Southern Water, Southern Power : How the Politics of Cheap Energy and Water Scarcity Shaped a Region|date=2015|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9781469623306|page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Civil War and Reconstruction===\n{{Main|Battle of Columbus (1865)}}\n[[File:Redd House Columbs Georgia.jpg|thumb|Redd House, Columbus, [[Historic American Buildings Survey]]]][[File:Rebels Rally.jpg|left|thumb|An 1863 broadside published in Columbus warning of an impending attack]]\nWhen the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out in 1861, the industries of Columbus expanded their production; this became one of the most important centers of industry in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. During the war, Columbus ranked second to Richmond in the manufacture of supplies for the Confederate army. The Eagle Manufacturing Company made textiles of various sorts, but especially woolens for Confederate uniforms. The Columbus Iron Works manufactured cannons and machinery, Greenwood and Gray made firearms, and Louis and Elias Haimon produced swords and bayonets. Smaller firms provided additional munitions and sundries. As the war turned negative, each faced exponentially growing struggled shortages of raw materials and skilled labor, as well as worsening financial opportunities.<ref>Stewart C. Edwards, \"'To do the manufacturing for the South': Private Industry in Confederate Columbus.\" ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' 85.4 (2001): 538-554.</ref> In addition to textiles, the city had an ironworks, a sword factory, and a shipyard for the [[Confederate Navy]].\n\nUnaware of [[Battle of Appomattox Court House#Surrender|Lee's surrender]] to Grant and the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], Union and Confederates clashed in the [[Battle of Columbus, Georgia]], on Easter Sunday, April 16, 1865, when a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] detachment of two cavalry divisions under Maj. Gen. [[James H. Wilson]] attacked the lightly defended city and burned many of the industrial buildings. [[John Pemberton|John Stith Pemberton]], who later developed [[Coca-Cola]] in Columbus, was wounded in this battle.  Col. [[Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar]], owner of the [[The Wanderer (slave ship)|last slave ship]] in America, was also killed here. A historic marker erected in Columbus notes that this was the site of the \"Last Land Battle in the War from 1861 to 1865.\"\n\n[[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] began almost immediately and prosperity followed. Factories such as the [[Eagle & Phenix Dam|Eagle and Phenix Mills]] were revived and the industrialization of the town led to rapid growth; the city outgrew its original plan. The [[Springer Opera House]] was built on 10th Street, attracting such notables as Irish writer [[Oscar Wilde]]. The Springer is now the official State Theater of Georgia.\n\nBy the time of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the city's modernization included the addition of trolleys extending to outlying neighborhoods such as Rose Hill and Lakebottom, and a new water works. Mayor Lucius Chappell also brought a training camp for soldiers to the area. This training camp named Camp Benning grew into present-day [[Fort Benning]], named for General [[Henry L. Benning]], a native of the city.\n[[File:Downtowncolumbus ga.gif|thumb|[[Downtown Columbus, Georgia|Downtown Columbus]] in the early 1950s]]\n\n===Confederate Memorial Day===\n{{Main|Confederate Memorial Day}}\nIn the spring of 1866, the [[Ladies Memorial Association]] of Columbus passed a resolution to set aside one day annually to memorialize the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] dead.

Early efforts to halt the gradual deterioration of downtown began with the saving and restoration of the Springer Opera House in 1965. It was designated as the State Theatre of Georgia, helping spark a historic preservation movement in the city. This has documented and preserved various historic districts in and around downtown.\n\nThrough the late 1960s and early 1970s, large residential neighborhoods were built to accommodate the soldiers coming back from the [[Vietnam War]] and for those associated with Ft. Benning. These range from Wesley Woods to Leesburg to Brittney and Willowbrook and the high-end Sears Woods and Windsor Park. Large tracts of blighted areas were cleaned up. A modern Columbus Consolidated Government Center was constructed in the city center. A significant period of urban renewal and revitalization followed in the mid- to late 1990s.\n\nWith these improvements, residents and businesses have been attracted to formerly blighted areas. Municipal projects have included construction of a softball complex, which hosted the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic]] softball competition; construction of the [[Chattahoochee RiverWalk]]; construction of the [[National Civil War Naval Museum at Port Columbus]], construction of the Coca-Cola Space Science Center, the expansion of the Columbus Museum, and road improvements to include a new downtown bridge crossing the Chattahoochee River to Phenix City.  During the late 1990s, commercial activity expanded north of downtown along the [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|I-185]] corridor.\n\n===21st century===\nDuring the 2000s, expansion and historic preservation continued throughout the city. South Commons has been revitalized. This area combines the 1996 Olympic softball competition complex, [[A. J. McClung Memorial Stadium]], [[Golden Park]], the [[Columbus Civic Center]], and the recently added Jonathan Hatcher Skateboard Park. The [[National Infantry Museum]] has been constructed in [[South Columbus, Georgia|South Columbus]], located outside the Fort Benning main gate.\n\nColumbus has a center for the fine and performing arts. [[RiverCenter for the Performing Arts]], which opened in 2002, houses Columbus State University's music department. In 2002, Columbus State's art and drama departments moved to downtown locations. Such initiatives have provided Columbus with a cultural niche and with vibrant and modern architecture mixed among older brick facades.\n\nThe \"Ready to Raft 2012\" campaign is a project that created an estimated 700 new jobs and is projected to bring in $42 million annually to the Columbus area. The project resulted in the longest urban whitewater rafting venue in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100430175135/http://www.wtvm.com/Global/story.asp?S=12378721].

The [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] is where the hilly lands of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] [[plateau]] meet the flat terrain of the [[coastal plain]]. As such, Columbus has a varied landscape of rolling hills on the north side and flat plains on the south. The [[fall line]] causes rivers in the area to decline rapidly towards sea level. Textile mills were established here in the 19th and early 20th centuries to take advantage of the water power from the falls. \n\nInterstate 185 runs north-south through the middle of the city, with nine exits within Muscogee County. I-185 runs north about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} from its beginning to a junction with [[Interstate 85 (Georgia)|I-85]] just east of [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Atlanta.

It has the longest urban [[whitewater]] [[rafting]] course in the world constructed on the Chattahoochee River.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Timeline of Columbus, Georgia}}\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Downtown columbus, georgia 1880.jpg|left|thumb|[[Downtown Columbus, Georgia|Downtown]] in 1880]]\nThis was for centuries and more the traditional territory of the [[Creek (people)|Creek Indians]], who became known as one of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the Southeast after European contact. Those who lived closest to white-occupied areas conducted considerable trading and adopted some European-American ways.\n\nFounded in 1828 by an act of the Georgia Legislature, Columbus was situated at the beginning of the navigable portion of the Chattahoochee River and on the last stretch of the [[Federal Road (Creek lands)|Federal Road]] before entering Alabama. The city was named for [[Christopher Columbus]]. The plan for the city was drawn up by Dr. Edwin L. DeGraffenried, who placed the town on a bluff overlooking the river. Across the river to the west, where Phenix City, Alabama, is now located, Creeks still lived until they were forcibly [[Indian Removal|removed]] in 1836 by the federal government to make way for European-American settlers.\n\nThe river served as Columbus's connection to the world, particularly enabling it to ship its commodity cotton crops from the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s to the international cotton market via [[New Orleans]] and ultimately [[Liverpool]], England. The city's [[commerce|commercial]] importance increased in the 1850s with the arrival of the railroad. In addition, [[textile]] mills were developed along the river, bringing industry to an area reliant upon agriculture. By 1860, the city was one of the more important industrial centers of the South, earning it the nickname \"the [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] of the South\", referring to an important textile mill town in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Manganiello|first1=Christopher J.|title=Southern Water, Southern Power : How the Politics of Cheap Energy and Water Scarcity Shaped a Region|date=2015|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9781469623306|page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Civil War and Reconstruction===\n{{Main|Battle of Columbus (1865)}}\n[[File:Redd House Columbs Georgia.jpg|thumb|Redd House, Columbus, [[Historic American Buildings Survey]]]][[File:Rebels Rally.jpg|left|thumb|An 1863 broadside published in Columbus warning of an impending attack]]\nWhen the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out in 1861, the industries of Columbus expanded their production; this became one of the most important centers of industry in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. During the war, Columbus ranked second to Richmond in the manufacture of supplies for the Confederate army. The Eagle Manufacturing Company made textiles of various sorts, but especially woolens for Confederate uniforms. The Columbus Iron Works manufactured cannons and machinery, Greenwood and Gray made firearms, and Louis and Elias Haimon produced swords and bayonets. Smaller firms provided additional munitions and sundries. As the war turned negative, each faced exponentially growing struggled shortages of raw materials and skilled labor, as well as worsening financial opportunities.<ref>Stewart C. Edwards, \"'To do the manufacturing for the South': Private Industry in Confederate Columbus.\" ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' 85.4 (2001): 538-554.</ref> In addition to textiles, the city had an ironworks, a sword factory, and a shipyard for the [[Confederate Navy]].\n\nUnaware of [[Battle of Appomattox Court House#Surrender|Lee's surrender]] to Grant and the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], Union and Confederates clashed in the [[Battle of Columbus, Georgia]], on Easter Sunday, April 16, 1865, when a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] detachment of two cavalry divisions under Maj. Gen. [[James H. Wilson]] attacked the lightly defended city and burned many of the industrial buildings. [[John Pemberton|John Stith Pemberton]], who later developed [[Coca-Cola]] in Columbus, was wounded in this battle.  Col. [[Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar]], owner of the [[The Wanderer (slave ship)|last slave ship]] in America, was also killed here. A historic marker erected in Columbus notes that this was the site of the \"Last Land Battle in the War from 1861 to 1865.\"\n\n[[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] began almost immediately and prosperity followed. Factories such as the [[Eagle & Phenix Dam|Eagle and Phenix Mills]] were revived and the industrialization of the town led to rapid growth; the city outgrew its original plan. The [[Springer Opera House]] was built on 10th Street, attracting such notables as Irish writer [[Oscar Wilde]]. The Springer is now the official State Theater of Georgia.\n\nBy the time of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the city's modernization included the addition of trolleys extending to outlying neighborhoods such as Rose Hill and Lakebottom, and a new water works. Mayor Lucius Chappell also brought a training camp for soldiers to the area. This training camp named Camp Benning grew into present-day [[Fort Benning]], named for General [[Henry L. Benning]], a native of the city.\n[[File:Downtowncolumbus ga.gif|thumb|[[Downtown Columbus, Georgia|Downtown Columbus]] in the early 1950s]]\n\n===Confederate Memorial Day===\n{{Main|Confederate Memorial Day}}\nIn the spring of 1866, the [[Ladies Memorial Association]] of Columbus passed a resolution to set aside one day annually to memorialize the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] dead.

This was the beginning of the influential work by ladies' organizations to honor the war dead.\n\nThe date for the holiday was selected by Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Rutherford Ellis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2901|title=Lizzie Rutherford (1833-1873)|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}</ref> She chose April 26, the first anniversary of Confederate General [[Joseph E.

Logan]], commander in chief of the Union Civil War Veterans Fraternity called the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], launched the [[Memorial Day]] holiday that has become observed in the entire United States. General Logan's wife said he had borrowed from practices of Confederate Memorial Day. She wrote that Logan \"said it was not too late for the Union men of the nation to follow the example of the people of the South in perpetuating the memory of their friends who had died for the cause they thought just and right.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA246&dq=%22not+too+late+for+the+Union+men+of+the+nation+to+follow+the+example+of+the+people+of+the+south%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KnDPUoH9GMjg2gXBgIGAAQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22not+too+late+for+the+Union+men+of+the+nation+to+follow+the+example+of+the+people+of+the+south%22%22&f=false|title=Reminiscences of a Soldier's Wife: An Autobiography|first=Mrs John A.|last=Logan|date=July 12, 2018|publisher=C.

In ''The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America'', they show that the Columbus Ladies Memorial Association's call to observe a day annually to decorate soldiers\u2019 graves inaugurated a movement first in the South and then in the North to honor the soldiers who died during the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America|last=Bellware|first=Daniel and Richard Gardiner, PhD.|publisher=Columbus State University|year=2014|isbn=978-0-692-29225-9|location=|pages=1\u2013181}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nWith the expansion of the city, leaders  established a university, founded Columbus College, a two-year institution, which later was developed as [[Columbus State University]], now a comprehensive center of higher learning.\n\nThe city government became consolidated with the county in 1971, the first of its kind in Georgia (and one of only 16 in the U.S. at the time).\n\nExpanding on its industrial base of textile mills, the city is the home of the headquarters for [[Aflac]], [[Synovus]], and [[TSYS]].\n[[File:Old columbus, georgia.jpg|thumb|left|The Muscogee County Courthouse in 1941, which was demolished in 1973.]]\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the subsidized construction of highways and suburbs resulted in drawing off the middle and upper classes, with [[urban blight]], [[white flight]], and prostitution in much of downtown Columbus and adjacent neighborhoods. Early efforts to halt the gradual deterioration of downtown began with the saving and restoration of the Springer Opera House in 1965. It was designated as the State Theatre of Georgia, helping spark a historic preservation movement in the city. This has documented and preserved various historic districts in and around downtown.\n\nThrough the late 1960s and early 1970s, large residential neighborhoods were built to accommodate the soldiers coming back from the [[Vietnam War]] and for those associated with Ft. Benning. These range from Wesley Woods to Leesburg to Brittney and Willowbrook and the high-end Sears Woods and Windsor Park. Large tracts of blighted areas were cleaned up. A modern Columbus Consolidated Government Center was constructed in the city center. A significant period of urban renewal and revitalization followed in the mid- to late 1990s.\n\nWith these improvements, residents and businesses have been attracted to formerly blighted areas. Municipal projects have included construction of a softball complex, which hosted the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic]] softball competition; construction of the [[Chattahoochee RiverWalk]]; construction of the [[National Civil War Naval Museum at Port Columbus]], construction of the Coca-Cola Space Science Center, the expansion of the Columbus Museum, and road improvements to include a new downtown bridge crossing the Chattahoochee River to Phenix City.  During the late 1990s, commercial activity expanded north of downtown along the [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|I-185]] corridor.\n\n===21st century===\nDuring the 2000s, expansion and historic preservation continued throughout the city. South Commons has been revitalized. This area combines the 1996 Olympic softball competition complex, [[A. J. McClung Memorial Stadium]], [[Golden Park]], the [[Columbus Civic Center]], and the recently added Jonathan Hatcher Skateboard Park. The [[National Infantry Museum]] has been constructed in [[South Columbus, Georgia|South Columbus]], located outside the Fort Benning main gate.\n\nColumbus has a center for the fine and performing arts. [[RiverCenter for the Performing Arts]], which opened in 2002, houses Columbus State University's music department. In 2002, Columbus State's art and drama departments moved to downtown locations. Such initiatives have provided Columbus with a cultural niche and with vibrant and modern architecture mixed among older brick facades.\n\nThe \"Ready to Raft 2012\" campaign is a project that created an estimated 700 new jobs and is projected to bring in $42 million annually to the Columbus area. The project resulted in the longest urban whitewater rafting venue in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100430175135/http://www.wtvm.com/Global/story.asp?S=12378721].

The [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] is where the hilly lands of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] [[plateau]] meet the flat terrain of the [[coastal plain]]. As such, Columbus has a varied landscape of rolling hills on the north side and flat plains on the south. The [[fall line]] causes rivers in the area to decline rapidly towards sea level. Textile mills were established here in the 19th and early 20th centuries to take advantage of the water power from the falls. \n\nInterstate 185 runs north-south through the middle of the city, with nine exits within Muscogee County. I-185 runs north about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} from its beginning to a junction with [[Interstate 85 (Georgia)|I-85]] just east of [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Atlanta. [[U.S. Route 27 in Georgia|U.S. Route 27]], [[U.S. Route 280#Georgia|U.S. Route 280]], and [[Georgia State Route 520]] (known as South Georgia Parkway) all meet in the interior of the city. [[U.S. Route 80#Georgia|U.S. Route 80]] runs through the northern part of the city, locally known as J.R.
