The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective (see [[#Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit]]).\n\nHowever, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27 \u00a7 4 WG/LArm):\n* Has a valid hunting license and is carrying the firearm for hunting.\n* Is participating in a demonstration and is carrying the firearm in reference to a historical event.\n* Is participating in a shooting competition for air-soft guns, provided that the competition has a secure perimeter.\n* Is an airport security officer for an authorized country, a border patrol officer, or a game warden, who is carrying the firearm in the course of their employment.\n\nFurthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may ''transport'' an unloaded firearm for special situations (see [[#Transporting guns]]).\n\n====Conditions for obtaining a Carrying Permit====\nThere are three conditions (art. 27 \u00a7 2 WG/LArm):\n* fulfilling the conditions for a buying permit (see section above).\n* stating plausibly the need to carry firearms to protect oneself, other people, or real property from a specified danger.\n* passing an examination proving both weapon handling skills and knowledge regarding lawful use of the weapon.\n\nThe carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued.

This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm):\n* The gun must be unloaded and transported separately from any ammunition, with no ammunition being transported in a magazine.\n* The transport must be by a reasonable route and requires a valid purpose:\n** To or from courses or exercises in marksmanship, hunting or for military purposes.\n** To or from an army warehouse.\n** To show the gun to a possible buyer.\n** To or from a holder of a valid arms trade permit.\n** To or from a specific event, e.g. gun shows.\n** During change of residence.\n\n===EU firearm ban===\n{{Main|European Firearms Directive\n|European Firearms Directive#Amending Directive (EU) 2017/853}}\n\nA 2017 amendment to the [[European Firearms Directive]], known as the \"'''EU Gun Ban'''\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-security-finland-idUKKBN0TZ1L820151216| title=Finland seeks exception from EU gun ban  |work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseaa.ch/fr/33-news/63-eu-gun-ban-intervention-suisse-a-bruxelles| title=EU Gun Ban : Intervention Suisse \u00e0 Bruxelles |publisher=ASEAA|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|title=Trilog schlie\u00dft die Verhandlungen zum \"EU-Gun ban\"|publisher=Firearms United|accessdate=2017-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060112/https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|archive-date=12 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-gun-lobby-mobilizing-against-new-firearms-guns-weapons-rules/| title=Gun lobby stirs to life in Europe |publisher=Politico|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref> introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition, especially on semi-automatic firearms, personal defense weapons, magazine capacity, blank firing guns and historical firearms.

The buyer must provide the following information to the seller (art. 15, 16 WG/LArm; art. 24 WV/OArm):<ref name=WV/><ref name=WG/>\n*a passport or other valid official identification (the holder must be over 18 years of age) (art. 10a WG/LArm).\n*a copy of their criminal record not older than 3 months, or a weapons acquisition permit which isn't older than 2 years, if asked by the seller (art. 24 \u00a7 3 WV/OArm).\n*Further, they must not be a citizen of the following countries (art. 12 WV/OArm): Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania).\n[[File:Schwarzpulver behaelter.jpg|thumb|A Swiss 100 gram black powder container.]]\nThe possession of the following ammunition is generally prohibited:\n* Armor-piercing bullets.\n* Ammunition with projectile containing an explosive or incendiary device.\n* Ammunition with one or more projectiles releasing substances which damage the health of people in the long run, particularly those mentioned in annex 2  of the WV/OArm.\n* Ammunition, missiles and missile launchers for military explosive.\n* Ammunition with projectiles for transmitting electric shocks.\n* Ammunition for handguns which may cause deformations.\n\n===Carrying guns===\nTo carry a firearm in public or outdoors (and for a militia member to carry a firearm other than his issued weapons while off-duty), a person must have a gun carrying permit ({{lang-de|Waffentragbewilligung}}, {{lang-fr|permis de port d'armes}}, {{lang-it|permesso di porto di armi}}; art. 27 WG/LArm), which in most cases is issued only to private citizens working in occupations such as security.<ref name=WG/> It is, however, quite common to see a person in military service to be ''en route'' with his rifle, albeit unloaded. The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective (see [[#Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit]]).\n\nHowever, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27 \u00a7 4 WG/LArm):\n* Has a valid hunting license and is carrying the firearm for hunting.\n* Is participating in a demonstration and is carrying the firearm in reference to a historical event.\n* Is participating in a shooting competition for air-soft guns, provided that the competition has a secure perimeter.\n* Is an airport security officer for an authorized country, a border patrol officer, or a game warden, who is carrying the firearm in the course of their employment.\n\nFurthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may ''transport'' an unloaded firearm for special situations (see [[#Transporting guns]]).\n\n====Conditions for obtaining a Carrying Permit====\nThere are three conditions (art. 27 \u00a7 2 WG/LArm):\n* fulfilling the conditions for a buying permit (see section above).\n* stating plausibly the need to carry firearms to protect oneself, other people, or real property from a specified danger.\n* passing an examination proving both weapon handling skills and knowledge regarding lawful use of the weapon.\n\nThe carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued. Additional constraints may be invoked to modify any specific permit. (art. 27 \u00a7 3 WG/LArm).\n\n===Transporting guns===\nGuns may be transported in public as long as an appropriate justification is present. This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm):\n* The gun must be unloaded and transported separately from any ammunition, with no ammunition being transported in a magazine.\n* The transport must be by a reasonable route and requires a valid purpose:\n** To or from courses or exercises in marksmanship, hunting or for military purposes.\n** To or from an army warehouse.\n** To show the gun to a possible buyer.\n** To or from a holder of a valid arms trade permit.\n** To or from a specific event, e.g. gun shows.\n** During change of residence.\n\n===EU firearm ban===\n{{Main|European Firearms Directive\n|European Firearms Directive#Amending Directive (EU) 2017/853}}\n\nA 2017 amendment to the [[European Firearms Directive]], known as the \"'''EU Gun Ban'''\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-security-finland-idUKKBN0TZ1L820151216| title=Finland seeks exception from EU gun ban  |work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseaa.ch/fr/33-news/63-eu-gun-ban-intervention-suisse-a-bruxelles| title=EU Gun Ban : Intervention Suisse \u00e0 Bruxelles |publisher=ASEAA|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|title=Trilog schlie\u00dft die Verhandlungen zum \"EU-Gun ban\"|publisher=Firearms United|accessdate=2017-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060112/https://firearms-united.com/de/2016/12/22/trilogue-ends-eu-gun-ban/|archive-date=12 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-gun-lobby-mobilizing-against-new-firearms-guns-weapons-rules/| title=Gun lobby stirs to life in Europe |publisher=Politico|accessdate=2017-03-09}}</ref> introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition, especially on semi-automatic firearms, personal defense weapons, magazine capacity, blank firing guns and historical firearms.

This was so that, in the case of an emergency, the militia could respond quickly.\n\n[[File:Stand-tir-p1000496.jpg|thumb|right|The federal shooting range of [[Versoix]], Switzerland; people come to such ranges to complete mandatory training (''Obligatorischeschiessen'') with service arms, or to shoot for sport and competition.]]\nIn December 2007, the [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided that the distribution of ammunition to soldiers would stop and that previously issued ammo would be returned. By March 2011, more than 99% of the ammo has been received.

Retrieved 12 January 2015.</ref> Identity cards that do not state EEA or Swiss citizenship, including national identity cards issued to residents who are not citizens, are not valid as a [[travel document]] within the EEA and Switzerland.\n\nNational identity cards are often accepted in other parts of the world for unofficial identification purposes (such as age verification in commercial establishments that serve or sell alcohol, or checking in at hotels) and sometimes for official purposes such as proof of identity/nationality to authorities (especially machine-readable cards).\n\nThree EEA member states do not issue cards defined by EU as national identity cards to their citizens: Denmark, Iceland and Norway; although Norway is expected to start issuing such cards from 2020.<ref name=\"no2020\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.abcnyheter.no/reise/reisenyheter/2018/05/07/195393945/justisdepartementet-tipper-nye-id-kort-og-pass-kommer-i-2020|title=Justisdepartementet: \u2013 Tipper nye ID-kort og pass kommer i 2020 {{!}} ABC Nyheter|date=2018-05-07|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> At present, citizens from these three countries can only use a passport as a [[travel document]] when travelling between EEA member states, and Switzerland.<ref>[http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/eu-citizen/index_en.htm Travel documents for EU nationals], europa.eu.

For example, where a supermarket in the UK refuses to accept a German national identity card as proof of age when a German citizen attempts to purchase an age-restricted product and insists on the production of a UK-issued passport or driving licence or other identity document, the supermarket would, in effect, be discriminating against this individual on this basis of his/her nationality in the provision of a service, thereby contravening the prohibition in [[Directive on services in the internal market|Art 20(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC]] of discriminatory treatment relating to the nationality of a service recipient in the conditions of access to a service which are made available to the public at large by a service provider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2014-004933&language=EN|title=Answer to a written question - Validity of national ID cards - E-004933/2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 2014, [[The Guardian]] published leaked internal documents from [[HM Passport Office]] in the UK which revealed that government officials who dealt with [[British passport]] applications sent from overseas treated EU citizen counter-signatories differently depending on their nationality.

In contrast, citizens of other EU member states ([[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]] and [[Spain]]) acting as counter-signatories could only submit a copy of their passport and not their national identity card to prove their identity as national identity cards issued by these member states were deemed by HM Passport Office to be less secure and more susceptible to fraud/forgery. The day following the revelations, on 12 June 2014, the [[Home Office]] and HM Passport Office withdrew the leaked internal guidance relating to EU citizen counter-signatories submitting a copy of their national identity card instead of their passport as proof of identity, and all EU citizen counter-signatories are now able only to submit a copy of their passport and not of their national identity card.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications|title=Countersigning passport applications and photos - GOV.UK|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/12/ministers-intervene-to-prevent-relaxation-of-rules-in-passport-office|title=Ministers intervene to prevent relaxation of checks at Passport Office|first=Rajeev|last=Syal|date=11 June 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==Common design and security features==\nOn 13 July 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called on all [[European Union member state]]s to adopt common designs and security features for national identity cards by December 2005, with detailed standards being laid out as soon as possible thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/05/st14/st14351.en05.pdf|title=Council of the European Union: Draft Conclusions of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on common minimum security standards for Member States' national identity cards|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 December 2006, all [[European Union member state]]s agreed to adopt the following common designs and minimum security standards for national identity cards that were in the draft resolution of 15 November 2006:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2006/dec/eu-id-cards.pdf|title=Council of the European Union: Draft Resolution of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council on common minimum security standards for Member States' national identity cards|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/EN-2006-REL.pdf|title=List of texts adopted by the Council in the JHA area&nbsp;\u2013 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n; Material\nThe card can be made with paper core that is laminated on both sides or made entirely of a synthetic substrate.\n\n; Biographical data\n\nThe data on the card shall contain at least: name, birth date, nationality, a photo, signature, card number, and end date of validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p5_cons_en.pdf|title=Machine Readable Travel Documents - Part 5|publisher=ICAO|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> Some cards contain more information such as height, eye colour, start date of validity, sex, issue place or province, and birth place.\n\nThe biographical data on the card is to be [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] and follow the ICAO specification for [[Machine-readable passport|machine-readable travel documents]].\n\nThe [[Regulation (European Union)|EU Regulation]] revising the Schengen Borders Code (which entered into force on 7 April 2017 and introduced systematic checks of the travel documents of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens against relevant databases when entering and leaving the [[Schengen Area]]) states that all member states should phase out travel documents (including national identity cards) which are not [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]].<ref>Recital 14 to Regulation (EU) 2017/458 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 amending Regulation (EU) 2016/399 as regards the reinforcement of checks against relevant databases at external borders ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.074.01.0001.01.ENG OJ L 74, 18 March 2017, p.1])</ref>\n\nHowever, as of 2017, Greece continues to issue solely non-machine readable identity cards, while Italy is in the process of phasing out the issuing of non-machine readable [[Identity document#Italy|paper booklets]] in favour of biometric cards.\n\n===Electronic identity cards===\nAll EEA electronic identity cards should comply with the [[ISO/IEC 14443|ISO/IEC standard 14443]].

In concert with other information, this attacker might then be able to produce profiles specific to a particular card and, consequently its bearer. Defence is a trivial task when most electronic cards make new and randomised UIDs during every session [NH08] to preserve a level of privacy more comparable with contact cards than commercial RFID tags.<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons\">{{cite book|last1=Helmbrecht|first1=Udo|last2=Naumann|first2=Ingo|chapter=8: Overview of European Electronic Identity Cards|editor1-last=Fumy|editor1-first=Walter|editor2-last=Paeschke|editor2-first=Manfred|title=Handbook of eID Security: Concepts, Practical Experiences, Technologies|volume=II|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|publication-date=2011|page=109|isbn=978-3-89578-379-1}}</ref>\n\nThe electronic identity cards of Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesdruckerei.de/sites/default/files/documents/2013/06/eid-card-pocketguide-en.pdf|title=Bundesdruckerei|publisher=}}</ref> Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Portugal and Spain all have a digital signature application which, upon activation, enables the bearer to authenticate the card using their confidential [[Personal identification number|PIN]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Consequently they can, at least theoretically, authenticate documents to satisfy any third party that the document's not been altered after being digitally signed.

Conference paper presented at ECIW'2010 describes \"''a case study of the re-engineering process used to discover the low-level application protocol data units  (APDUs) and their associated significance when used in communications with the Portuguese e-id smart card... primarily done simply to learn the processes involved given the low level of documentation available from the Portuguese government concerning the inner workings of the Citizens Card... also done in order to produce a generic platform for accessing and auditing the Portuguese Citizen Card and for using Match-on-Card biometrics for use in different scenarios... The Portuguese government rolled out a new  electronic identity card ... called the \"Cart\u00e3o de Cidad\u00e3o Portugu\u00eas\" produced by the \"Imprensa  Nacional-Casa  da  Moeda\" (INCM\nwww.incm.pt).

Some countries demand the usage of the national identity card or a passport. Other countries allow usage of other documents like driver's licences.\n\nIn some countries, e.g. Austria, Finland and Sweden, national identity cards are fully voluntary and not needed by everyone, as identity documents like driving licences are accepted domestically. In these countries only a minority have a national identity card, since a majority have a passport and a driving licence and don't need more identity documents.

For example, where a supermarket in the UK refuses to accept a German national identity card as proof of age when a German citizen attempts to purchase an age-restricted product and insists on the production of a UK-issued passport or driving licence or other identity document, the supermarket would, in effect, be discriminating against this individual on this basis of his/her nationality in the provision of a service, thereby contravening the prohibition in [[Directive on services in the internal market|Art 20(2) of Directive 2006/123/EC]] of discriminatory treatment relating to the nationality of a service recipient in the conditions of access to a service which are made available to the public at large by a service provider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2014-004933&language=EN|title=Answer to a written question - Validity of national ID cards - E-004933/2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 June 2014, [[The Guardian]] published leaked internal documents from [[HM Passport Office]] in the UK which revealed that government officials who dealt with [[British passport]] applications sent from overseas treated EU citizen counter-signatories differently depending on their nationality.

In contrast, citizens of other EU member states ([[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]] and [[Spain]]) acting as counter-signatories could only submit a copy of their passport and not their national identity card to prove their identity as national identity cards issued by these member states were deemed by HM Passport Office to be less secure and more susceptible to fraud/forgery. The day following the revelations, on 12 June 2014, the [[Home Office]] and HM Passport Office withdrew the leaked internal guidance relating to EU citizen counter-signatories submitting a copy of their national identity card instead of their passport as proof of identity, and all EU citizen counter-signatories are now able only to submit a copy of their passport and not of their national identity card.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications|title=Countersigning passport applications and photos - GOV.UK|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/12/ministers-intervene-to-prevent-relaxation-of-rules-in-passport-office|title=Ministers intervene to prevent relaxation of checks at Passport Office|first=Rajeev|last=Syal|date=11 June 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==Common design and security features==\nOn 13 July 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called on all [[European Union member state]]s to adopt common designs and security features for national identity cards by December 2005, with detailed standards being laid out as soon as possible thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/05/st14/st14351.en05.pdf|title=Council of the European Union: Draft Conclusions of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on common minimum security standards for Member States' national identity cards|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 December 2006, all [[European Union member state]]s agreed to adopt the following common designs and minimum security standards for national identity cards that were in the draft resolution of 15 November 2006:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2006/dec/eu-id-cards.pdf|title=Council of the European Union: Draft Resolution of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council on common minimum security standards for Member States' national identity cards|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/EN-2006-REL.pdf|title=List of texts adopted by the Council in the JHA area&nbsp;\u2013 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n; Material\nThe card can be made with paper core that is laminated on both sides or made entirely of a synthetic substrate.\n\n; Biographical data\n\nThe data on the card shall contain at least: name, birth date, nationality, a photo, signature, card number, and end date of validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p5_cons_en.pdf|title=Machine Readable Travel Documents - Part 5|publisher=ICAO|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> Some cards contain more information such as height, eye colour, start date of validity, sex, issue place or province, and birth place.\n\nThe biographical data on the card is to be [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] and follow the ICAO specification for [[Machine-readable passport|machine-readable travel documents]].\n\nThe [[Regulation (European Union)|EU Regulation]] revising the Schengen Borders Code (which entered into force on 7 April 2017 and introduced systematic checks of the travel documents of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens against relevant databases when entering and leaving the [[Schengen Area]]) states that all member states should phase out travel documents (including national identity cards) which are not [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]].<ref>Recital 14 to Regulation (EU) 2017/458 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 amending Regulation (EU) 2016/399 as regards the reinforcement of checks against relevant databases at external borders ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2017.074.01.0001.01.ENG OJ L 74, 18 March 2017, p.1])</ref>\n\nHowever, as of 2017, Greece continues to issue solely non-machine readable identity cards, while Italy is in the process of phasing out the issuing of non-machine readable [[Identity document#Italy|paper booklets]] in favour of biometric cards.\n\n===Electronic identity cards===\nAll EEA electronic identity cards should comply with the [[ISO/IEC 14443|ISO/IEC standard 14443]].

In concert with other information, this attacker might then be able to produce profiles specific to a particular card and, consequently its bearer. Defence is a trivial task when most electronic cards make new and randomised UIDs during every session [NH08] to preserve a level of privacy more comparable with contact cards than commercial RFID tags.<ref name=\"John Wiley & Sons\">{{cite book|last1=Helmbrecht|first1=Udo|last2=Naumann|first2=Ingo|chapter=8: Overview of European Electronic Identity Cards|editor1-last=Fumy|editor1-first=Walter|editor2-last=Paeschke|editor2-first=Manfred|title=Handbook of eID Security: Concepts, Practical Experiences, Technologies|volume=II|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|publication-date=2011|page=109|isbn=978-3-89578-379-1}}</ref>\n\nThe electronic identity cards of Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesdruckerei.de/sites/default/files/documents/2013/06/eid-card-pocketguide-en.pdf|title=Bundesdruckerei|publisher=}}</ref> Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Portugal and Spain all have a digital signature application which, upon activation, enables the bearer to authenticate the card using their confidential [[Personal identification number|PIN]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Consequently they can, at least theoretically, authenticate documents to satisfy any third party that the document's not been altered after being digitally signed.

Conference paper presented at ECIW'2010 describes \"''a case study of the re-engineering process used to discover the low-level application protocol data units  (APDUs) and their associated significance when used in communications with the Portuguese e-id smart card... primarily done simply to learn the processes involved given the low level of documentation available from the Portuguese government concerning the inner workings of the Citizens Card... also done in order to produce a generic platform for accessing and auditing the Portuguese Citizen Card and for using Match-on-Card biometrics for use in different scenarios... The Portuguese government rolled out a new  electronic identity card ... called the \"Cart\u00e3o de Cidad\u00e3o Portugu\u00eas\" produced by the \"Imprensa  Nacional-Casa  da  Moeda\" (INCM\nwww.incm.pt).

Population estimated at 13,000 residents, all of whom are [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholic]].\n\n==Etymology==\nKahale is derived from [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Aramaic]], from ''kah'' (verb meaning breathed or respired); ''al'' or ''el'' (the name of the [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] god [[El (god)|El]], who was considered the father of God and of mankind); and ''e'' (an ending denoting that the god El is the speaker's god)\n\n==Geography==\nConsidering the locale and geography of the Kahale this name is suited well. A valley extends from the Sh'har west side of the Kahale into the Rjoum, eastern side of the Kahale.

Population estimated at 13,000 residents, all of whom are [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholic]].\n\n==Etymology==\nKahale is derived from [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Aramaic]], from ''kah'' (verb meaning breathed or respired); ''al'' or ''el'' (the name of the [[Canaanite]] god [[El (god)|El]], who was considered the father of God and of mankind); and ''e'' (an ending denoting that the god El is the speaker's god)\n\n==Geography==\nConsidering the locale and geography of the Kahale this name is suited well. A valley extends from the Sh'har west side of the Kahale into the Rjoum, eastern side of the Kahale. In this valley, the winds accelerate as if being sped along by some external supernatural will, the will of the ancient god El.\n\n==Religion==\nKahale has a predominantly, if not wholly, Maronite Catholic population, with a Druze minority. \n\nThe village has three churches:\n*Mar Elias (\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0633 )\n*Our Lady (\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u062f\u0629)\n*Mar Antonios (\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0633)\n\nThis in addition to [[Don Bosco]] monastery and school, and [[Saint Charbel]] Home for the elderly which is now closed.\n\n==Geography==\nLatitude: 33\u00b049'18.64\"N, longitude: 35\u00b035'14.55\"E, 200 to 500&nbsp;m above sea level and a land size of approximately 1.96 square kilometers.\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20060901151618/http://www.kahale.net/\n\n==References==\n*Abi Khalil, Charbel.
