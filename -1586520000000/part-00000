{"title_page": "Oblivious transfer", "text_new": "In [[cryptography]], an '''oblivious transfer''' ('''OT''') protocol is a type of protocol in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information to a receiver, but remains [[wikt:oblivious|oblivious]] as to what piece (if any) has been transferred.\n\nThe first form of oblivious transfer was introduced in 1981 by [[Michael O. Rabin]].{{ref|Note1|1}}  In this form, the sender sends a message to the receiver with [[probability]] 1/2, while the sender remains oblivious as to whether or not the receiver received the message.  Rabin's oblivious transfer scheme is based on the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] cryptosystem.  A more useful form of oblivious transfer called '''1\u20132 oblivious transfer''' or \"1 out of 2 oblivious transfer\", was developed later by [[Shimon Even]], [[Oded Goldreich]], and [[Abraham Lempel]],{{ref|Note2|2}} in order to build protocols for [[secure multiparty computation]]. It is generalized to \"1 out of ''n'' oblivious transfer\" where the user gets exactly one database element without the server getting to know which element was queried, and without the user knowing anything about the other elements that were not retrieved. The latter notion of oblivious transfer is a strengthening of [[private information retrieval]], in which the database is not kept private.\n\n[[Claude Cr\u00e9peau]] showed that Rabin's oblivious transfer is equivalent to 1\u20132 oblivious transfer.{{ref|Note3|3}}\n\nFurther work has revealed oblivious transfer to be a fundamental and important problem in cryptography.  It is considered one of the critical problems in the field, because of the importance of the applications that can be built based on it. In particular, it is [[Complete (complexity)|complete]] for [[secure multiparty computation]]: that is, given an implementation of oblivious transfer it is possible to securely evaluate any polynomial time computable function without any additional primitive.{{ref|Note4|4}}\n\n==Rabin's oblivious transfer protocol==\n\nIn Rabin's oblivious transfer protocol, the sender generates an RSA public modulus ''N''=''pq'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are large [[prime number]]s, and an exponent ''e'' [[relatively prime]] to ''\u03bb(N)'' = (''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)(''q''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1).  The sender encrypts the message ''m'' as ''m''<sup>''e''</sup> mod ''N''.\n\n# The sender sends ''N'', ''e'', and ''m''<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''N'' to the receiver.\n# The receiver picks a random ''x''&nbsp;modulo&nbsp;''N'' and sends ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''N'' to the sender. Note that gcd(''x'',''N'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 with overwhelming probability, which ensures that there are 4 square roots of ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''N''.\n# The sender finds a square root ''y'' of ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''N'' and sends ''y'' to the receiver.\n\nIf the receiver finds ''y'' is neither ''x'' nor \u2212''x'' modulo ''N'', the receiver will be able to [[integer factorization|factor]] ''N'' and therefore decrypt ''m''<sup>''e''</sup> to recover ''m'' (see [[Rabin encryption]] for more details).  However, if ''y'' is ''x'' or \u2212''x''&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''N'', the receiver will have no information about ''m'' beyond the encryption of it.  Since every [[quadratic residue]] modulo ''N'' has four square roots, the probability that the receiver learns ''m'' is 1/2.\n\n==1\u20132 oblivious transfer==\n\nIn a 1\u20132 oblivious transfer protocol, the sender has two messages ''m''<sub>0</sub> and ''m''<sub>1</sub>, and the receiver has a bit ''b'', and the receiver wishes to receive ''m''<sub>''b''</sub>, without the sender learning ''b'', while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receives only one of the two messages.\nThe protocol of Even, Goldreich, and Lempel (which the authors attribute partially to [[Silvio Micali]]), is general, but can be instantiated using RSA encryption as follows.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=3 | Alice\n! rowspan=2 |\n! colspan=3 | Bob\n|-\n!

One of these will be equal to <math>k</math> and can be correctly decrypted by Bob (but not Alice), while the other will produce a meaningless random value that does not reveal any information about <math>k</math>.\n# She combines the two secret messages with each of the possible keys, <math>m'_0 = m_0 + k_0</math> and <math>m'_1 = m_1 + k_1</math>, and sends them both to Bob.\n# Bob knows which of the two messages can be unblinded with <math>k</math>, so he is able to compute exactly one of the messages <math>m_b = m'_b - k</math>\n\n==1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer and ''k''-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer==\n\nA 1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer protocol can be defined as a natural generalization of a 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol. Specifically, a sender has ''n'' messages, and the receiver has an index ''i'', and the receiver wishes to receive the ''i''-th among the sender's messages, without the sender learning ''i'', while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receive only one of the ''n'' messages.\n\n1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer is incomparable to [[private information retrieval]] (PIR).\nOn the one hand, 1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer imposes an additional privacy requirement for the database: namely, that the receiver learn at most one of the database entries. On the other hand, PIR requires communication [[sublinear]] in ''n'', whereas 1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer has no such requirement.\n\n1-''n'' oblivious transfer protocols were proposed, e.g., by [[Moni Naor]] and [[Benny Pinkas]],{{Ref|Pinkas|10}} [[William Aiello]], [[Yuval Ishai]] and [[Omer Reingold]],{{Ref|Aiello|11}} [[Sven Laur]] and [[Helger Lipmaa]].{{Ref|Laur|12}}. In 2017, [[Kolesnikov et al.]],{{Ref|Kov|13}} proposed an efficient 1-n oblivious transfer protocol which requires roughly 4x the cost of 1-2 oblivious transfer in amortized setting.\n\n[[Gilles Brassard|Brassard]], [[Claude Cr\u00e9peau|Cr\u00e9peau]] and [[Jean-Marc Robert|Robert]] further generalized this notion to ''k''-''n'' oblivious transfer,{{ref|Note5|5}} wherein the receiver obtains a set of ''k'' messages from the ''n'' message collection.  The set of ''k'' messages may be received simultaneously (\"non-adaptively\"), or they may be requested consecutively, with each request based on previous messages received.{{ref|Note6|6}}\n\n==Generalized oblivious transfer==\n''k''-''n'' Oblivious transfer is a special case of generalized oblivious transfer, which was presented by Ishai and Kushilevitz.{{ref|Note7|7}} In that setting, the sender has a set ''U'' of ''n'' messages, and the transfer constraints are specified by a collection ''A'' of permissible subsets of ''U''.\nThe receiver may obtain any subset of the messages in ''U'' that appears in the collection ''A''. The sender should remain oblivious of the selection made by the receiver, while the receiver cannot learn the value of the messages outside the subset of messages that he chose to obtain. The collection ''A'' is monotone decreasing, in the sense that it is closed under containment (i.e., if a given subset ''B'' is in the collection ''A'', so are all of the subsets of ''B'').\nThe solution proposed by Ishai and Kushilevitz uses the parallel invocations of 1-2 oblivious transfer while making use of a special model of private protocols. Later on, other solutions that are based on secret sharing were published \u2013 one by Bhavani Shankar, Kannan Srinathan, and [[C. Pandu Rangan]],{{ref|Note8|8}} and another by Tamir Tassa.{{ref|Note9|9}}\n\n==Origins==\nIn the early seventies [[Stephen Wiesner]] introduced a primitive called '''multiplexing''' in his seminal paper \"Conjugate Coding\",\nwhich was the starting point of [[quantum cryptography]].{{ref|Note0}} Unfortunately it took more than ten years to be published. Even though\nthis primitive was equivalent to what was later called ''1\u20132 oblivious transfer'', Wiesner did not see its application to cryptography.\n\n==Quantum oblivious transfer==\n\nProtocols for oblivious transfer can be implemented with [[quantum systems]]. In contrast to other tasks in [[quantum cryptography]], like [[quantum key distribution]], it has been shown that quantum oblivious transfer cannot be implemented with unconditional security, i.e. the security of quantum oblivious transfer protocols cannot be guaranteed only from the laws of [[quantum physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lo|first=H.-K.|date= 1997|title=Insecurity of quantum secure computations|url=https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1154|journal=Phys.

Specifically, a sender has ''n'' messages, and the receiver has an index ''i'', and the receiver wishes to receive the ''i''-th among the sender's messages, without the sender learning ''i'', while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receive only one of the ''n'' messages. \n\n1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer is incomparable to [[private information retrieval]] (PIR).\nOn the one hand, 1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer imposes an additional privacy requirement for the database: namely, that the receiver learn at most one of the database entries. On the other hand, PIR requires communication [[sublinear]] in ''n'', whereas 1-out-of-''n'' oblivious transfer has no such requirement. \n\n1-''n'' oblivious transfer protocols were proposed, e.g., by [[Moni Naor]] and [[Benny Pinkas]],{{Ref|Pinkas|10}} [[William Aiello]], [[Yuval Ishai]] and [[Omer Reingold]],{{Ref|Aiello|11}} [[Sven Laur]] and [[Helger Lipmaa]].{{Ref|Laur|12}}. In 2017, [[Kolesnikov et al.]],{{Ref|Kov|13}} proposed an efficient 1-n oblivious transfer protocol which requires roughly 4x the cost of 1-2 oblivious transfer in amortized setting.\n\n[[Gilles Brassard|Brassard]], [[Claude Cr\u00e9peau|Cr\u00e9peau]] and [[Jean-Marc Robert|Robert]] further generalized this notion to ''k''-''n'' oblivious transfer,{{ref|Note5|5}} wherein the receiver obtains a set of ''k'' messages from the ''n'' message collection.  The set of ''k'' messages may be received simultaneously (\"non-adaptively\"), or they may be requested consecutively, with each request based on previous messages received.{{ref|Note6|6}}\n\n==Generalized oblivious transfer==\n''k''-''n'' Oblivious transfer is a special case of generalized oblivious transfer, which was presented by Ishai and Kushilevitz.{{ref|Note7|7}} In that setting, the sender has a set ''U'' of ''n'' messages, and the transfer constraints are specified by a collection ''A'' of permissible subsets of ''U''.\nThe receiver may obtain any subset of the messages in ''U'' that appears in the collection ''A''. The sender should remain oblivious of the selection made by the receiver, while the receiver cannot learn the value of the messages outside the subset of messages that he chose to obtain. The collection ''A'' is monotone decreasing, in the sense that it is closed under containment (i.e., if a given subset ''B'' is in the collection ''A'', so are all of the subsets of ''B'').\nThe solution proposed by Ishai and Kushilevitz uses the parallel invocations of 1-2 oblivious transfer while making use of a special model of private protocols. Later on, other solutions that are based on secret sharing were published \u2013 one by Bhavani Shankar, Kannan Srinathan, and [[C. Pandu Rangan]],{{ref|Note8|8}} and another by Tamir Tassa.{{ref|Note9|9}}\n\n==Origins==\nIn the early seventies [[Stephen Wiesner]] introduced a primitive called '''multiplexing''' in his seminal paper \"Conjugate Coding\",\nwhich was the starting point of [[quantum cryptography]].{{ref|Note0}} Unfortunately it took more than ten years to be published. Even though\nthis primitive was equivalent to what was later called ''1\u20132 oblivious transfer'', Wiesner did not see its application to cryptography.\n\n==Quantum oblivious transfer==\n\nProtocols for oblivious transfer can be implemented with [[quantum systems]]. In contrast to other tasks in [[quantum cryptography]], like [[quantum key distribution]], it has been shown that quantum oblivious transfer cannot be implemented with unconditional security, i.e. the security of quantum oblivious transfer protocols cannot be guaranteed only from the laws of [[quantum physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lo|first=H.-K.|date= 1997|title=Insecurity of quantum secure computations|url=https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1154|journal=Phys.

It is one of the 275 ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]s'' and no [[Navagraha]] where the two of the most revered [[Nayanars]] ([[Saivite]] Saints), [[Appar]] and [[Campantar|Tirugnana Sambandar]] have glorified the temple with their verses during the 7th-8th century. The temple has been widely expanded by [[Chola]] kings during the 11th century.<ref name=\"matters\"/> The temple has two seven tiered gateway towers, a huge tank, with the overall temple area covering 1 acre. The Marundeeswarar temple has been a place of curative worship for people with diseases.\n\nThe temple has six daily rituals at various times from [[5:30]] a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the [[Chola dynasty]] in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Vijayanagar rulers. The temple is maintained and administered by the [[Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]] of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The latest consecration of the temple after renovation was performed during February 2020. The previous one was in May 2008.\n\n== Legend ==\n[[File:Thiruvanmiyur5.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Image of the Marundeeswarar shrine]]\nMarundeeswarar is known so because he imparted sage [[Agastya]] on curative properties of various herbs and plants.<ref name=\"matters\">[[#Hodgetts|Hodgetts 2008]], p.55</ref> Since then the Marundeeswarar temple has been a place of worship for people with diseases and various problems with their health.<ref name=\"ttdc\"/> It is said that sage [[Valmiki]], who wrote ''[[Ramayana]]'', worshiped Shiva in the temple.<ref name=\"kamath\"/> Since Valmiki was blessed here, the place was to be known as Thiruvalmikiyur, which is pronounced as 'Thiruvanmikiyur' in Tamil, the name gradually changed to Thiruvanmiyur.<ref name=\"V.\">[[#V.|V. 2006]], p. 14</ref> There is a place present in Thiruvanmiyur called Valmiki Nagar in his honour.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]].

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat. A variety of weapons are used, including [[Mace (bludgeon)|iron clubs]] (''Eisenkolben''), [[Flail (weapon)|flails]] (''Drischel''), swords (''Turnierschwert'')<ref name=krause179>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=179}}</ref> and daggers.<ref name=krause181>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=181}}</ref> The ''[[Melee (tournament)|m\u00eal\u00e9e]]'' is also shown in the manuscript.<ref name=Clephan87/>\n\nAfter each of the sixty-four tournaments is a scene depicting a [[moresca]] (a pantomime dance) or other post-tournament festivities with male courtiers, including the knights who had competed in the tournament, dressing up to dance in a variety of exotic costumes.<ref name=Locke121/> Known as \u2018mummeries\u2019, these were a regular feature of the evening entertainment after tournaments.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nThe male courtiers in the mummeries in the manuscript dress up, amongst other things, in costumes based on nationality or ethnicity, for example [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] costume, or as animals such as [[apes]] and creatures with bird's heads.<ref name=Locke121/> In one masquerade illustrated, the male participants engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear women's gowns.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nIn each scene, all the men are dressed in the same costume and normally wear a mask. Women, however, are always shown wearing their usual court attire.<ref name=Locke121/> In each of these post-tournament pictures, Freydal appears carrying a torch and wearing a mask.<ref name=Locke121/> The ''Freydal'' illustrations constitute the most extensive pictorial record of these late medieval court masquerades.<ref name=moma122/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = center\n | header = <br>Scenes from the Kunsthistorisches Museum ''Freydal'' illuminated manuscript\n | total_width = 725\n | image_style = border:none;\n | perrow = 3\n\n | image2 = Freydal KK5073.jpg\n | alt2 = Flying shields\n | caption2 = ''Scharfrennen''&nbsp;\u2013 joust of war with flying shields (fol.157)\n\n | image1 = Stechen gegen Graf Sigmund von Hardegk.jpg\n | alt1 = Stechen\n | caption1 = ''Stechen''&nbsp;\u2013 joust of peace, against Sigmund von Hardegk (fol.106)\n\n | image3 = Freydal fol14.jpg\n | alt3 = Italian\n | caption3 = ''Welsches Gestecht''&nbsp;\u2013 Italian joust of peace (fol.14)\n\n | image4 = Freydal fol156 Mummerei.jpg\n | alt4 = Mummery\n | caption4 = Mummery festivities (fol.156)\n\n | image6 = Masquerade, Freydal manuscript, folio 207.jpg\n | alt6 = Cross-dressing mummery \n | caption6 = Cross-dressing mummery (fol. 207)\n\n | image5 = Freydal fol083.jpg\n | alt5 = Flail\n | caption5 = Foot combat with flails against Wilhelm Auer von Herrenkirchen zu Neudorf (fol.83)<ref name=krause179/>\n\n}}\n==Significance==\nTournament books were a feature of late medieval and renaissance courtly culture and provide a graphic record of the jousting and it\u2019s rituals.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

German identity and the problem of history. ''History and ethnicity'', p.146</ref>\n\nPan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of [[East Prussia]], sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.\n\n===1871\u20131918===\n{{Further|Unification of Germany}}\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria\u2013Hungary, 1910]]\nBy the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire. [[German nationalism in Austria]] grew among all social circles of the empire, many wanted to be unified with the German Reich to form a [[Greater Germany]] and wanted policies to be carried out to enforce their German ethnic identity rejecting any Austrian pan-ethnic identity.<ref name=\"DPSO\">{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in \u00d6sterreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423112116/http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | archive-date=23 April 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Many German Austrians felt annoyed that they were excluded from the German Empire since it included various non-German ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Urspr\u00fcnge, Anf\u00e4nge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&pg=PA41 |isbn=9783825230760 }}</ref> Prominent Austrian pan-Germans such as [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]]  created pan-German movements which demanded the annexation of all ethnic German territories.

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Nationalism and Pan-Germanism became almost taboo because they had been used so destructively by the Nazis. Indeed, the word \"Volksdeutscher\" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging \"[[Gastarbeiter]]\" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Further|German reunification}}\n\nHowever, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates.

And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position at the center of the Continent.\"<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> Heilbrunn believes that the adage, \"what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union\" has been supplanted by a new mentality\u2014what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its [[Nazi]] past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed\u2014and not represented\u2014by [[Nazism]].<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy.

[[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspaper in 2003 referred to Matisse as \"art royalty\",<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> a term occasionally [[paraphrase]]d when discussing Matisse and her artwork.\n\n==Early life==\nMatisse was born in [[Boston]] on February 13, 1965,<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"Chess\"/>\nand was raised in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> having what has been described as a \"[[hippie]] childhood\".<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> Her father is the sculptor [[Paul Matisse]], whose grandfather was [[Henri Matisse]].<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\nMatisse had \"serious\" [[dyslexia]] in her youth,<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> which she remedied through creative pursuits.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Education==\nMatisse began studies in 1985 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston, but she dropped out after her first year.<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> In 1990, she relocated to [[Paris, France|Paris]] and attended the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]],<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"Chess\"/> the same institution where her great-grandfather [[Henri Matisse]] had studied.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> She also bought supplies at the same art-supply store where he had shopped.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\nMatisse lived with her grandmother Teeny Duchamp in France for a time. Teeny, after divorcing [[Pierre Matisse]], had married the French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] (Duchamp died in 1968).<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> Studies at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts were not easy for Matisse; not only facing imposed expectations of being an art student in France named \"Matisse\", but also being an American lacking proficiency in reading and writing French.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> After three years Matisse was asked to leave.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> She did, however, meet the French artist [[Alain Jacquet]] while at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, whom she married in 1992.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1996, Matisse moved to New York City, setting up her studio in Manhattan's [[Tribeca]] neighborhood, and soon began exhibiting her artwork.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> The artist's 1997 painting [[Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations|''Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes)'']]<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> initiated art world interest which furthered her career. In the painting, Matisse replicated the background setting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s original, but omitted the [[eponymous]] subject Mona Lisa from the scene.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS A&GT\"/> It was the first of what became her signature ''Be Back in 5 Minutes'' series.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nThe ''Be Back in Five Minutes'' series gave Matisse her first widespread exposure as an artist, in her own right, and informed her work for years thereafter. In those paintings, Matisse reproduced the recognizable settings of famous paintings, always omitting the figures; as if the models had \"stepped out for the moment\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\nFamous works of [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] also figured prominently in other early entries to the series; ''[[Young Woman with a Water Pitcher]]'', ''[[The Art of Painting]]'', and ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''  were all reinterpreted by Matisse in the late 1990s, minus the figures portrayed by Vermeer.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nAlthough she had previously participated in group exhibitions in New York and elsewhere, Matisse's first solo exhibition opened in January 2002, at the gallery which continued to represent her in New York, Francis Naumann Fine Art. It was the gallery's first exhibition of [[Contemporary art]].<ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> Matisse's ''Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes)'' was featured in this first exhibition along with over twenty others of the artist's absentee paintings.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nAmong American artworks from which Matisse \"removed\" the occupants are [[Grant Wood]]'s ''[[American Gothic]]'', in which the [[pitchfork]] is left standing alone in the foreground, and [[Edward Hopper]]'s ''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'', in which the [[diner]] is replicated devoid of customers and staff. Both of these were painted in 2001.<ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\nThe artwork of Henri Matisse is also among those reinterpreted. ''Goldfish'' reproduces the scene as originally portrayed by him, minus the [[goldfish]]. ''[[The Conversation (painting)|The Conversation]]'' leaves an empty chair by the window.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nArtwork from this series was also assembled for an exhibition titled \"Once Removed\" at the [[Upstate New York|upstate New York]] [[Katonah Museum of Art]] in the summer of 2005.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS A&GT\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/>\n\n===Matisse's reinterpretation of ''Guernica''===\nIn 2003, Matisse added [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to the number of paintings she reinterpreted.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> This time, Matisse opted to \"colorize\" Picasso's [[monochrome|monochromatic]] \"anti-war testament\" \u2014 a painting to which she had never actually stood \"face to face\".<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> \nDespite her great-grandfather and Picasso's \"rocky relationship\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Vanity Fair|first=John|last=Richardson|date=February 2003 |title=Between Picasso and Matisse |accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2003/02/picasso-matisse200302}}</ref>\nMatisse followed her own color sensibilities, as opposed to mimicking those of her great-grandfather.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/>\n\nMatisse used Guerra Paint acrylics and painted on canvas,<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> testing color combinations by first painting many small sketches.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> She kept true to the impact of Picasso's original by painting it large-scale, approximately {{convert|8|by|20|ft}}. Her efforts yielded several paintings and various drawings, which culminated in her Sophie Matisse Does Guernica exhibition, early in 2003 in New York.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> One piece, ''911 Guernica'', uses ''Guernica'' as the motif to convey her own first hand experiences witnessing the terrorist attack on New York's [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers]] from her neighborhood near the site.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> Matisse's ''Guernica'' exhibition was scheduled to coincide with the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s dual survey exhibiting the works of both Picasso and Matisse.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/>\n\nThe artist and her \"Be Back in 5 minutes\" series faced as much opposition as they did praise, with some critics deriding her \"coloring-in\" of Picasso by comparing it with the colorization of black and white movies.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/> Art critic [[Arthur Danto]] said Matisse's work \"demonstrates why Picasso was right to use black and white and gray, and why Matisse was exactly right never to have attempted to depict violence\".\n\nMatisse in 2003 also participated in a project coordinated by [[Dodie Kazanjian]] for ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' magazine.\n\"Self Portraits: A Vogue Portfolio\" appeared in print as a ten-page feature in the December 2003, issue of the magazine.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/> As the title suggests, each artist submitted a \"self-portrait\". Matisse was featured among other female artists of her generation such as [[Kiki Smith]]. Matisse's contribution was a \"Be Back in 5 Minutes\" interpretation of [[Gustave Courbet]]'s erotic painting ''[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]'', this time removing the 19th century French painter's graphically portrayed [[Nude (painting)|nude]] model, leaving only the rumpled bedsheets. The completed artworks were exhibited at [[Deitch Projects]] SoHo gallery space at the time of publication.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/>\n\n===Zebra stripe paintings===\nMatisse began a new series of paintings in the Spring of 2004, which culminated in her third solo exhibition, the Zebra Stripe Paintings,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/> debuting in New York in the latter months of 2005.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/><ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> Matisse once again appropriated historically significant artworks, this time superimposing her own imagery in the form of zebra stripes overlapping the originals. In these paintings, all acrylics and oil on canvas, the appropriated originals are somewhat obscured by the stripes, rendering them less readily identifiable,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> and the artist herself has joked that her dyslexia may have been helpful in creating these works.<ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> The series was compared to [[James Rosenquist]]'s later works, juxtaposing and overlapping seemingly unrelated imagery.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> Matisse again appropriated one of her great-grandfather's artworks, this time overlaying his ''Blue Nude'' with her zebra stripes.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Special projects==\nMatisse has provided artwork in collaboration with business interests and also in support of charitable causes. In 2008, She collaborated with [[Kilian Hennessy]], heir to the [[Hennessy]] lineage of [[cognac]] makers, providing artwork for a line of fragrances. Matisse added her personal touch to fifty bottles of Kilian perfumes, hand-painting, signing and numbering every bottle and its box. Each of the limited edition creations bore a design different from the others.  Additionally, Matisse collaborated with @byKilian in December 2009 on 15 hand-painted, Special Edition (Gold) perfume bottles, which were sold to key By Kilian clients.<ref name=\"Kilian\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net OBJECT\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2008\"/>\n\nFor an exhibition titled The Art of the Game coinciding with [[San Diego]]'s Beyond the Border International Contemporary Art Fair of 2009, Matisse created five chess sets of her own design. She considered her participation \"a tribute\" to the game's presence within her family in general, and her upbringing personally.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Matisse participated in the New York installment of an international campaign produced by the non-profit group [[Sing For Hope]].\nThe project called for 60 pianos to be placed in specifically chosen public places around a chosen city, in this case New York City, each first hand-painted by participating artists and amateurs alike. The decorated pianos remained at their specified locations for two weeks in July 2010, with the instructions \"Play me, I'm yours\" clearly marked, and an attendant present to oversee and invite passersby. Matisse hand-painted four [[Kimball International#Kimball piano and organ|Kimball]] pianos, all of which had been donated for the cause, even painting the piano keys. Some, if not all, of Sophie's four were displayed in the lobby of [[Avery Fisher Hall]] and [[Lincoln Center]] [[esplanade|promenade]]. All 60 pianos were auctioned that fall.<ref name=\"Pianos1\"/><ref name=\"Pianos2\"/><ref name=\"Pianos3\"/>\n\nMatisse is represented by Francis Naumann Fine Art, LLC, in New York City.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1992, when she was 27, Matisse married French [[Pop art]]ist [[Alain Jacquet]], who was then 53,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> whom she had met during her years at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Jacquet similarly reworked classic artworks into his own creations, which have been described as \"Pop subterfuge\".<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> The marriage produced a daughter, [[Ga\u00efa Jacquet-Matisse]], born in 1993.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> Matisse and Jacquet were considered a \"perfect couple\" by friends and acquaintances, and remained married until Jacquet's death, at age 69, in 2008.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/>\nMatisse married Amar Zribi in St. Martin FWI, in 2012.<ref name=\"marriage Vogue\"/>\n\n===Family background===\nMatisse's father is the sculptor and inventor [[Paul Matisse]], a [[Harvard]] graduate.<ref name=\"Chess\"/> Her grandfather, Paul's father, was [[Modern art]] dealer [[Pierre Matisse]], who had moved to America in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/> Pierre was the youngest child of 20th century painter [[Henri Matisse]], Sophie's great-grandfather.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nHenri Matisse died in 1954, aged 85, eleven years before Sophie's birth. Family members expressed concern as to Sophie's use of the Matisse name, and in her youth she was discouraged from admitting to be a descendant of her great-grandfather. Only by incidentally noticing her family name on museum walls did Sophie come to consider that her great-grandfather may have been someone \"exceptional\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/>\n\nMatisse's step-grandfather was the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]], who [[Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations|reinterpreted Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa'']] in his ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' by adding a mustache.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"New Yorker\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> Duchamp married Matisse's grandmother Alexina \"Teeny\" Matisse, an American,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> in 1954 after she and Pierre Matisse had divorced.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> Matisse has cited Duchamp as an influence, once saying \"his presence stopped me from getting too serious\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> Art writers have pointed to the \"[[visual pun|visual jokes]]\" sometimes apparent in Matisse's own work as a sign of Duchamp's influence.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\">{{cite web | url = http://sophiematisse.net/fr/cms_items/view/1/element:4/Biography | title =

paintings, in which she appropriated and embellished upon, or subtracted from, recognizable works from art history.\n\nMedia coverage is often quick to note Matisse's family background, an art [[pedigree chart|pedigree]] originating with her great-grandfather, the 20th century painter [[Henri Matisse]]. [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspaper in 2003 referred to Matisse as \"art royalty\",<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> a term occasionally [[paraphrase]]d when discussing Matisse and her artwork.\n\n==Early life==\nMatisse was born in [[Boston]] on February 13, 1965,<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"Chess\"/>\nand was raised in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> having what has been described as a \"[[hippie]] childhood\".<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> Her father is the sculptor [[Paul Matisse]], whose grandfather was [[Henri Matisse]].<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\nMatisse had \"serious\" [[dyslexia]] in her youth,<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> which she remedied through creative pursuits.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Education==\nMatisse began studies in 1985 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston, but she dropped out after her first year.<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> In 1990, she relocated to [[Paris, France|Paris]] and attended the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]],<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\"/><ref name=\"Chess\"/> the same institution where her great-grandfather [[Henri Matisse]] had studied.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> She also bought supplies at the same art-supply store where he had shopped.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\nMatisse lived with her grandmother Teeny Duchamp in France for a time. Teeny, after divorcing [[Pierre Matisse]], had married the French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] (Duchamp died in 1968).<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> Studies at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts were not easy for Matisse; not only facing imposed expectations of being an art student in France named \"Matisse\", but also being an American lacking proficiency in reading and writing French.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> After three years Matisse was asked to leave.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> She did, however, meet the French artist [[Alain Jacquet]] while at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, whom she married in 1992.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1996, Matisse moved to New York City, setting up her studio in Manhattan's [[Tribeca]] neighborhood, and soon began exhibiting her artwork.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> The artist's 1997 painting [[Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations|''Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes)'']]<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> initiated art world interest which furthered her career. In the painting, Matisse replicated the background setting of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s original, but omitted the [[eponymous]] subject Mona Lisa from the scene.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS A&GT\"/> It was the first of what became her signature ''Be Back in 5 Minutes'' series.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nThe ''Be Back in Five Minutes'' series gave Matisse her first widespread exposure as an artist, in her own right, and informed her work for years thereafter. In those paintings, Matisse reproduced the recognizable settings of famous paintings, always omitting the figures; as if the models had \"stepped out for the moment\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\nFamous works of [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] also figured prominently in other early entries to the series; ''[[Young Woman with a Water Pitcher]]'', ''[[The Art of Painting]]'', and ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''  were all reinterpreted by Matisse in the late 1990s, minus the figures portrayed by Vermeer.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nAlthough she had previously participated in group exhibitions in New York and elsewhere, Matisse's first solo exhibition opened in January 2002, at the gallery which continued to represent her in New York, Francis Naumann Fine Art. It was the gallery's first exhibition of [[Contemporary art]].<ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> Matisse's ''Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes)'' was featured in this first exhibition along with over twenty others of the artist's absentee paintings.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nAmong American artworks from which Matisse \"removed\" the occupants are [[Grant Wood]]'s ''[[American Gothic]]'', in which the [[pitchfork]] is left standing alone in the foreground, and [[Edward Hopper]]'s ''[[Nighthawks (painting)|Nighthawks]]'', in which the [[diner]] is replicated devoid of customers and staff. Both of these were painted in 2001.<ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\nThe artwork of Henri Matisse is also among those reinterpreted. ''Goldfish'' reproduces the scene as originally portrayed by him, minus the [[goldfish]]. ''[[The Conversation (painting)|The Conversation]]'' leaves an empty chair by the window.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nArtwork from this series was also assembled for an exhibition titled \"Once Removed\" at the [[Upstate New York|upstate New York]] [[Katonah Museum of Art]] in the summer of 2005.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS A&GT\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/>\n\n===Matisse's reinterpretation of ''Guernica''===\nIn 2003, Matisse added [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to the number of paintings she reinterpreted.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> This time, Matisse opted to \"colorize\" Picasso's [[monochrome|monochromatic]] \"anti-war testament\" \u2014 a painting to which she had never actually stood \"face to face\".<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> \nDespite her great-grandfather and Picasso's \"rocky relationship\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Vanity Fair|first=John|last=Richardson|date=February 2003 |title=Between Picasso and Matisse |accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2003/02/picasso-matisse200302}}</ref>\nMatisse followed her own color sensibilities, as opposed to mimicking those of her great-grandfather.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/>\n\nMatisse used Guerra Paint acrylics and painted on canvas,<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> testing color combinations by first painting onto photocopies.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> She kept true to the impact of Picasso's original by painting it large-scale, approximately {{convert|8|by|20|ft}}. Her efforts yielded several paintings and various drawings, which culminated in her Sophie Matisse Does Guernica exhibition, early in 2003 in New York.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> One piece, ''911 Guernica'', uses ''Guernica'' as the motif to convey her own first hand experiences witnessing the terrorist attack on New York's [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers]] from her neighborhood near the site.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> Matisse's ''Guernica'' exhibition was scheduled to coincide with the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s dual survey exhibiting the works of both Picasso and Matisse.<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/>\n\nThe artist and her \"Be Back in 5 minutes\" series faced as much opposition as they did praise, with some critics deriding her \"coloring-in\" of Picasso by comparing it with the colorization of black and white movies.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/> Art critic [[Arthur Danto]] said Matisse's work \"demonstrates why Picasso was right to use black and white and gray, and why Matisse was exactly right never to have attempted to depict violence\".\n\nMatisse in 2003 also participated in a project coordinated by [[Dodie Kazanjian]] for ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' magazine.\n\"Self Portraits: A Vogue Portfolio\" appeared in print as a ten-page feature in the December 2003, issue of the magazine.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/> As the title suggests, each artist submitted a \"self-portrait\". Matisse was featured among other female artists of her generation such as [[Kiki Smith]]. Matisse's contribution was a \"Be Back in 5 Minutes\" interpretation of [[Gustave Courbet]]'s erotic painting ''[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]'', this time removing the 19th century French painter's graphically portrayed [[Nude (painting)|nude]] model, leaving only the rumpled bedsheets. The completed artworks were exhibited at [[Deitch Projects]] SoHo gallery space at the time of publication.<ref name=\"Self portrait Vogue03\"/>\n\n===Zebra stripe paintings===\nMatisse began a new series of paintings in the Spring of 2004, which culminated in her third solo exhibition, the Zebra Stripe Paintings,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/> debuting in New York in the latter months of 2005.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS ZSPcat\"/><ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> Matisse once again appropriated historically significant artworks, this time superimposing her own imagery in the form of zebra stripes overlapping the originals. In these paintings, all acrylics and oil on canvas, the appropriated originals are somewhat obscured by the stripes, rendering them less readily identifiable,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> and the artist herself has joked that her dyslexia may have been helpful in creating these works.<ref name=\"Sophies Choices\"/> The series was compared to [[James Rosenquist]]'s later works, juxtaposing and overlapping seemingly unrelated imagery.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> Matisse again appropriated one of her great-grandfather's artworks, this time overlaying his ''Blue Nude'' with her zebra stripes.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/>\n\n==Special projects==\nMatisse has provided artwork in collaboration with business interests and also in support of charitable causes. In 2008, She collaborated with [[Kilian Hennessy]], heir to the [[Hennessy]] lineage of [[cognac]] makers, providing artwork for a line of fragrances. Matisse added her personal touch to fifty bottles of Kilian perfumes, hand-painting, signing and numbering every bottle and its box. Each of the limited edition creations bore a design different from the others.  Additionally, Matisse collaborated with @byKilian in December 2009 on 15 hand-painted, Special Edition (Gold) perfume bottles, which were sold to key By Kilian clients.<ref name=\"Kilian\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net OBJECT\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2008\"/>\n\nFor an exhibition titled The Art of the Game coinciding with [[San Diego]]'s Beyond the Border International Contemporary Art Fair of 2009, Matisse created five chess sets of her own design. She considered her participation \"a tribute\" to the game's presence within her family in general, and her upbringing personally.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Matisse participated in the New York installment of an international campaign produced by the non-profit group [[Sing For Hope]].\nThe project called for 60 pianos to be placed in specifically chosen public places around a chosen city, in this case New York City, each first hand-painted by participating artists and amateurs alike. The decorated pianos remained at their specified locations for two weeks in July 2010, with the instructions \"Play me, I'm yours\" clearly marked, and an attendant present to oversee and invite passersby. Matisse hand-painted four [[Kimball International#Kimball piano and organ|Kimball]] pianos, all of which had been donated for the cause, even painting the piano keys. Some, if not all, of Sophie's four were displayed in the lobby of [[Avery Fisher Hall]] and [[Lincoln Center]] [[esplanade|promenade]]. All 60 pianos were auctioned that fall.<ref name=\"Pianos1\"/><ref name=\"Pianos2\"/><ref name=\"Pianos3\"/>\n\nMatisse is represented by Francis Naumann Fine Art, LLC, in New York City.<ref name=\"Chess\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1992, when she was 27, Matisse married French [[Pop art]]ist [[Alain Jacquet]], who was then 53,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> whom she had met during her years at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Jacquet similarly reworked classic artworks into his own creations, which have been described as \"Pop subterfuge\".<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/> The marriage produced a daughter, [[Ga\u00efa Jacquet-Matisse]], born in 1993.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> Matisse and Jacquet were considered a \"perfect couple\" by friends and acquaintances, and remained married until Jacquet's death, at age 69, in 2008.<ref name=\"artnet ALAIN\"/>\nMatisse married Amar Zribi in St. Martin FWI, in 2012.<ref name=\"marriage Vogue\"/>\n\n===Family background===\nMatisse's father is the sculptor and inventor [[Paul Matisse]], a [[Harvard]] graduate.<ref name=\"Chess\"/> Her grandfather, Paul's father, was [[Modern art]] dealer [[Pierre Matisse]], who had moved to America in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/> Pierre was the youngest child of 20th century painter [[Henri Matisse]], Sophie's great-grandfather.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS AiA\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/>\n\nHenri Matisse died in 1954, aged 85, eleven years before Sophie's birth. Family members expressed concern as to Sophie's use of the Matisse name, and in her youth she was discouraged from admitting to be a descendant of her great-grandfather. Only by incidentally noticing her family name on museum walls did Sophie come to consider that her great-grandfather may have been someone \"exceptional\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/><ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Tele\"/>\n\nMatisse's step-grandfather was the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]], who [[Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations|reinterpreted Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa'']] in his ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' by adding a mustache.<ref name=\"Chess\"/><ref name=\"New Yorker\"/><ref name=\"artnet Back in Five\"/> Duchamp married Matisse's grandmother Alexina \"Teeny\" Matisse, an American,<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS Vog2004\"/> in 1954 after she and Pierre Matisse had divorced.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> Matisse has cited Duchamp as an influence, once saying \"his presence stopped me from getting too serious\".<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/> Art writers have pointed to the \"[[visual pun|visual jokes]]\" sometimes apparent in Matisse's own work as a sign of Duchamp's influence.<ref name=\"s.m.net PRESS H&Q\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"s.m.net BIO\">{{cite web | url = http://sophiematisse.net/fr/cms_items/view/1/element:4/Biography | title =
