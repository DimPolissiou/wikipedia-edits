In February 2012, both services aired a promotion, announcing the split of CHASE and TGC to form themselves as separate channels. On February 15, 2012, The Game Channel finally shuts down on free TV and was relaunched as a cable channel; CHASE was also relaunched as a separate channel, now occupying the entire BEAM broadcast airtime on Free TV.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Solar transferred its former Salcedo Village facilities to their new facility in Worldwide Corporate Center in [[Mandaluyong|Mandaluyong City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2012/04/solar-news-update-debuts-new-look.html|title=Solar News Update debuts new look|website=Medianewser.com}}</ref> It also featured a newly constructed set for Solar's then-news division, which would become fully functional three months later.\n\nOn July 16, 2012, Solar News launched its first local newscast ''Solar Network News'', followed by ''Solar Nightly News'', an hourly Solar News Update, Solar Daybreak, and Solar Newsday.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, Jack TV plugged their announcement through CHASE programs bearing the title \"Another Jack TV is rising, coming soon on this channel\" (BEAM Channel 31). This indicated that CHASE was being replaced; finally, on October 20, 2012, Jack City was then launched, marking October 19 as the end of CHASE's broadcasts. [[Jack City]] still does carry some of CHASE's programs however.\n\nIn October 2012, it was found out that Solar News would replace the government-controlled RPN News, as a result of RPN's privatization, making Solar TV covering the entire network's airtime. More than 200 RPN employees, particularly those from the labor union and the NewsWatch staff, were retrenched and RPN News was closed down on October 29, effectively axing NewsWatch and NewsCap. Some retrenched government employees were relocated to either [[People's Television Network|People's Television Network (PTV 4)]] or [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC 13)]] (both State-run broadcasters).\n\n[[File:FvfOmbudsman0222 37.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A [[Toyota HiAce]] van used by Solar News parked at the Office of the Ombudsman.]]\nOn October 30, 2012, at 5:45 am, TalkTV was replaced as Solar News Channel on Channel 21 via [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]]. The channel saw the relaunch of sports news program ''Solar Sports Desk'' (now known as [[Sports Desk (2004 TV series)|CNN Philippines Sports Desk]]), as well as the initial telecast of the Solar News and Current affairs block in November 2012 comprising five public affairs programs ([[Legal Help Desk|Legal HD]], [[MedTalk]], [[News.PH]], [[Opposing Views]], Elections 2013 and [[News Cafe]]), ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Undercover Boss (U.S. TV series)|Undercover Boss]]'' and the \"Stories\" [[documentary film|documentaries]] block. In January 2013, Solar News Cebuano (now known as [[CNN Philippines Cebuano News]]) made history as the first national newscast delivered in a local dialect. In 2014, it also launched the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] national newscast, [[Kapampangan News]] and the public service program ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]'', which is shown in [[Filipino language]].\n\nPrior to the channel's transfer to RPN, SNC's flagship newscast (Solar Network News) simulcasted on RPN 9 (free TV only) from the SNC's launch. The news content for RPN (then affiliated with ETC), however, was switched to ''Solar Nightly News'' on January 14, 2013, onwards, to avoid backlash from free TV viewers, particularly Free TV viewers of ''[[American Idol]]'' (in which the original plan was to replace the 6 pm via satellite broadcast to Free TV viewers by Network News, then airs the AI episodes at the 8 pm rerun in simulcast with cable and satellite viewers). Throughout the ''American Idol'' season, as the episodes are repeated at 8 PM on cable, Solar used the separate free TV-only feed, that contains reruns of selected ETC shows (but with advertisements replaced by ETC teasers and promotions) at 8&nbsp;pm and ''Nightly News'' at 9 PM (with additional ETC programs, if necessary) to be used by RPN after each AI via satellite episode before RPN returns to the main ETC feed at 10 PM. This is to retain RPN's news content as it then has no newscast since the axing of NewsWatch.\n\nOn January 3, 2013, SEC launched Blink Cinema (later renamed as [[My Movie Channel]]) with the full broadcast taking effect later that month.\n\nOn April 14, 2013, [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5 Network Inc.]] and Solar Entertainment Corporation joined to broadcast the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]] in Manila on Philippine television on August 1\u201311. Aside from [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and its sister channel ([[AksyonTV]]), the games were also broadcast over Solar\u2019s cable channel [[Basketball TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/tv5-solar-team-up-for-2013-fiba-asia-championship-coverage|title=TV5, Solar team up for 2013 FIBA Asia Championship coverage - InterAksyon.com - Sports5|author=|date=|work=InterAksyon.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===New management===\nOn May 22, 2013, Solar Entertainment Corporation appointed two officers to manage its broadcasting and cable businesses: Manuel \u201cMeckoy\u201d Quiogue as chief commercial officer and Maria Theresa \u201cMitos\u201d Borromeo as chief operating officer (COO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.ph/lifestyle/2013/05/22/solar-entertainment-corp.-appoints-2-new-officers|title=9news.ph - 9news Resources and Information.|author=|date=|work=9news.ph|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> However, Quiogue suddenly died on May 31, 2013 prior to assuming his position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=73221|title=Your life is your message to the world|work=BWorldOnline.com|access-date=April 6, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221542/http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=73221|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 28, 2013, [[Jack City]] reduced its free TV broadcast to 18 hours a day on BEAM in compliance with the [[National Telecommunications Commission]]'s guidelines. However, it still continues to air as a cable channel 24 hours a day.\n\nOn November 9, 2013, [[San Miguel Corporation]]'s president and COO, [[Ramon S.

As a result of this ownership change, STVNI, Solar News Channel and RPN's majority stake were separated from the Tiengs; while ETC, 2nd Avenue, and Jack City reverted to Solar Entertainment's ownership.\n\nOn September 1, 2014, [[Jack City]] ended its run on free TV due to the preparations being made by [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media|BEAM 31]] for the incoming transition to ISDB-T digital television, though it continues to be broadcast as a separate cable channel. However, Jack City continued to broadcast on cable networks until March 21, 2015. After Jack City's closure to free TV, BEAM aired under blocktime programs from various local production and religious companies. On November 15, 2014, BEAM began being carried on [[SkyCable]] and Destiny Cable subscribers (per compliance with NTC's \"must-carry\" basis). This move resulted of Jack City in a change of its channel assignment for SkyCable and [[Destiny Cable]] subscribers, as well as several pay TV companies.\n\nIn 2015, Solar Entertainment Corporation launched the #1stonPHTV brand of Solar channels for [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Jack TV]], Jack City and [[My Movie Channel]], with the brand implemented on January 6, 2015. Since then, all SEC channels broadcast first-run foreign television programs with the hashtag #1stonPHTV (First on Philippine TV), which was formerly known as \"Match Airing\" (ETC), \"Playing 1st\" (Jack TV), \"The Newest in the US\" and \"FastCast\" (2nd Avenue) and \"See It First\" (Jack City).\n\n[[The Game Channel]], after almost three years on broadcasting, selling or ceased on February 28, 2015. The channel space was taken over by [[My Movie Channel]] on March 1.\n\nOn March 22, 2015, Jack City was replaced by [[CT (TV channel)|CT]], thus becoming independent from its parent network. Upon launch, the channel broadened its programming focus by adding talk shows, sitcoms and men's lifestyle programs to its roster.\n\nOn March 26, 2015, Solar Entertainment announced its broadcast of the \"Fight Of The Century\" between [[Manny Pacquiao]] and [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] on May 3, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/2015/03/27/1437964/abs-cbn-gma-tv5-join-hands-air-pacquiao-fight-networks-unite-historic|title=ABS-CBN, GMA, TV5 join hands to air Pacquiao fight: Networks unite for historic broadcast|first=Abac|last=Cordero|date=March 27, 2015|work=PhilStar.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> As stated in a press conference that day, it was broadcast on May 3 via delayed broadcast in three major television stations in the Philippines, [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], and [[GMA Network]] (who waived its exclusive contract with Solar to allow its multi-network coverage, but maintained its exclusive live broadcast on its radio division), with [[Solar Sports]] as its main content provider for this historic event in boxing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/88062-pacquiao-mayweather-television-broadcast-ph|title=Pacquiao vs Mayweather to be televised by GMA, ABS-CBN and TV5|author=|date=|work=Rappler.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/459458/sports/boxing/pacquiao-mayweather-fight-to-air-live-over-gma-radio-stations-nationwide|title=Pacquiao-Mayweather fight to air live over GMA radio stations nationwide|author=|date=|work=GMANetwork.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2015, My Movie Channel ceased broadcasting. The closure or selling was announced by Solar a day before.\n\n===Rebranding of the four flagship networks===\nOn October 16, 2016, Solar relaunched its flagship channels ETC, 2nd Avenue, Basketball TV and Solar Sports. The four networks unveiled their new logos, on-air graphics and station IDs, which took effect on that day. CT, Jack TV, Shop TV and NBA Premium TV on the other hand remains unchanged. Also that day, Solar launched its corporate campaign slogan ''...There's More To Come'', which evolved in 2017 as ''We go for More''.\n\nIn 2017, Solar Entertainment became the official Philippine broadcaster of the 65th edition of the [[Miss Universe]] in Manila. This led to another deal with [[ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]] (the second time that such deal happened between Solar and the Big 3 networks). According to some sources, a directive from [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Duterte]] ordered that the major networks must cover the prestige pageant as it happens live in the [[Philippines]]. Alongside the Big Three, Solar Entertainment channels [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|etc]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Jack TV]] and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] aired the pageant simultaneously. It was also in the same year when Solar Entertainment forged a joint venture with the Bermuda-based communications satellite company [[Asia Broadcast Satellite]] to launch the first nationwide free-to-air [[Satellite television#Direct broadcast via satellite|direct-to-home]] satellite television services using the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]], which is set to launch on the 3rd quarter of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/broadcasting/2017/05/22/abs-solar-group-launch-new-dth-service-philippines/|title=ABS, The Solar Group to Launch New DTH Service in the Philippines|author=Kendall Russell|date=May 22, 2017|work=Satellite Today|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Carriage disputes==\n===Sky Cable===\n====2008====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSolar's channels have ceased airing on [[Sky Cable]], the Philippines' largest cable television provider. An insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that these troubles with Sky Cable started when boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]], whose fights Solar Entertainment has the exclusive right to air and distribute to, moved from [[ABS-CBN]], the flagship television network of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and the primary owner of [[Sky Cable Corporation]], to rival [[GMA Network]]. Another insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that SkyCable wanted to remove [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and [[Jack TV]] to make room for their own channels, [[Velvet (TV channel)|Velvet]] (now defunct) and [[Maxxx]] (now defunct). Sky Cable wanted to retain [[C/S]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Solar Sports]] and [[Basketball TV]], but Solar made a decision that they would only renew their contract if Sky Cable carried all six channels. Thus, Solar decided to pull out all their channels rather than remove ETC and Jack TV.\n\nHowever, Solar has signed a deal with local terrestrial channels [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC]], [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] and [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|RJTV]] for block-time programming. C/S, ETC and 2nd Avenue programming are seen on terrestrial TV channels RPN, SBN and RJTV, respectively, while [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[WWE]] programming were seen on TV5, now moved to RPN (WWE programming are currently being broadcast thru TV5, while its terrestrial NBA coverage were moved to [[ABS-CBN Sports]] under Solar).\n\nMost of its channels were later returned to Sky Cable, while Jack TV would eventually return to its lineup on January 1, 2010 replacing Maxxx.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacquiao's boxing promotion, [[Top Rank]], signed a non-guaranteed contract with [[ABS-CBN Sports]] to exclusively air fights promoted by Top Rank, with the exception of Pacquiao fights which are still signed exclusively through Solar Entertainment.\n\n====2017\u201319====\nOn April 10, 2017, 3 days before the [[2017 NBA Playoffs]] was scheduled to begin (and coincided with the final day of the [[2016\u201317 NBA season|2016\u201317 NBA regular season]]), Basketball TV, [[NBA Premium TV]], Solar Sports, Jack TV and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] (now defunct) were removed by Solar from Sky Cable (including [[Sky Direct]], [[Destiny Cable]] & [[Sky On Demand]] thru video on demand) without any prior announcement from Solar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/167065-sky-nba-premium-btv-unavailable |title=Sky subscribers frustrated as NBA Premium, BTV unavailable for playoffs start |last= Rola|first=Alyssa |date= April 16, 2017|website=[[Rappler]] |access-date= April 16, 2017|quote=}}</ref> Initially, both Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV were replaced by airing a simulcast of [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]] with a ticker announcing the unavailability of the channels, with Solar Sports, Jack TV and CT (now defunct) also doing the latter albeit with a black screen. Later, almost all of the pulled-out Solar channels were replaced by an imaging card, initially detailing the unavailability of the channels and then later, announcing that they will discuss with Solar on returning the aforementioned channels; while for BTV and NBA Premium TV, a schedule of the NBA games that will air on [[ABS-CBN]], ABS-CBN Sports and Action and [[Fox Sports Asia|Fox Sports]] within the week and a loop of an NBA promo. Solar did not comment on the situation for the removal of the channels, but sources and some netizens pointed out a carriage dispute between the two parties for not paying an undisclosed price to continue broadcasting these channels, which was later proven true by an article published by the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''.\n\nAs the dispute continued, some media enthusiasts and netizens raised concerns of whether these Solar channels will return to Sky and/or Destiny. Others pointed that inaction between the two parties could affect the next long-term local broadcast franchise with the NBA, slated to begin at the Association's 2019-2020 regular season. (Currently, Solar and Sky's parent, ABS-CBN, have a shared broadcast agreement to air the NBA games on pay and terrestrial television, respectively. Rumours circulated that both networks may bid separately, if they could not reach renewal, and use their respective infrastructure to broadcast adequate NBA coverage; otherwise, rival networks with a functioning sports department like [[5 (TV channel)|The 5 Network]] may also seek their own bidding to steal the 2019 contract from both Solar and ABS-CBN.)\n\nNetizens and viewers were dismayed and frustrated by the removal of the said channels by Sky Cable, most notably for BTV and NBA Premium due to the importance of the Playoffs. Some netizens were angered by the removal of the said channels and asked Sky Cable to return the channels before the scheduled Playoffs would begin, however Sky Cable would respond to angered netizens on social media that they are \"fixing the situation with Solar\". Other netizens and viewers would otherwise switch providers from Sky Cable to other cable companies that carried these channels or to other satellite providers like [[Cignal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/news/sky-cable-nba-premium-basketball-tv-negotiations-with-solar |title=SKYcable unable to give timetable for return of NBA Premium, Basketball TV to channel lineup |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=April 15, 2017 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=April 16, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 2018, Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV returned to Sky Cable, Sky Direct, & Sky On Demand for the first time in 18 months<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-btv-channels-back-on-skycable-per-advisory-a795-20181016 |title=NBA Premium, BTV channels back on SKYCable, per advisory |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=October 16, 2018 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=October 26, 2018 |quote=}}</ref>; however it was later removed on October 28, 2018 for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mysky.com.ph/MetroManila/updates/1031/2018/10/28/sky-advisory|title=SKY Advisory|website=Me & My SKY: SKY at 25 years}}</ref>\n\nThe carriage dispute officially ended on January 1, 2019 when all Solar channels: Basketball TV, NBA Premium TV, Solar Sports, and Jack TV were restored on Sky Cable (including Sky On Demand & Sky Direct).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-and-btv-are-back-in-skycable-s-channel-lineup-a795-20190101|title=NBA Premium and BTV are back in SKYcable's channel lineup|website=Spin.ph}}</ref>\n\nIronically, [[MTVph]], which is a Solar channel, ended its operations on the same day at that time Sky returned the affected Solar channels. As of 2019, Sky Cable's sister company Destiny Cable still does not carry all the aforementioned Solar channels despite its aforementioned return on Sky Cable.\n\nDuring the aforementioned period, [[Shop TV]], ETC and 2nd Avenue (now defunct) were kept on the air, due to the \"must-carry\" rules by the NTC. MTVph was also kept on the air (until it was discontinued on January 1, 2019) since it was carried in a separate programming agreement outside of the affected channels despite its ownership.\n\n===Dream Satellite TV===\n[[Dream Satellite TV]] ceased carrying three Solar Channels, namely [[Solar Sports]], [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] (which was at that time a cable channel prior to its move to free TV and cable) and [[2nd Avenue (TV channel)|2nd Avenue]] (now defunct) (except [[C/S 9]]) effective 1 February 2009. Dream's carriage contract with Solar Entertainment, which expired on 31 December 2008 was not renewed by Dream, citing financial constraints as its main reason. The three Solar channels were replaced by A&E's [[History (South East Asian TV channel)|The History Channel]], [[Bio.

This channel was later known as Solar USA (the acronym stands for \"Ultimate in Suspense and Action\"), and then later simply as USA before it was replaced by two separate channels.\n\nIn January 2004, Solar launched on cable sports alternative channel as Sports Plus.\n\nOn August 23, 2004, Solar Entertainment launched [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] or Entertainment Central, which is positioned as the country\u2019s premier cable female entertainment channel. ETC is a platform that brings its audience closer to their aspirational lifestyle, as embodied by their idols.\n\nOn May 5, 2005, it test launched delivering debuting service. Intended for a predominantly male audience, the company launched the country\u2019s leading general entertainment cable channel, [[Jack TV]], in July.\n\nOn October 15, 2005, Solar Entertainment launched a crime and action cable channel, Crime/Suspense or [[C/S]].\n\nOn December 15, 2005, Solar Entertainment launched a spin-off channel to ETC, [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|ETC 2nd Avenue]], a lifestyle and general entertainment channel.

The move was a result of [[SkyCable]] pulling out C/S, ETC, and 2nd Avenue from the cable company's lineup at their own right. Those three started carrying shows from Solar's, with [[C/S]] on RPN, [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|ETC]] on SBN, and [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]] on RJTV.\n\n[[File:Solar Sports.png|200px|thumb|left| Former logo of [[Solar Sports]]]]\nOn May 22, 2009, a victory party for [[Manny Pacquiao|Manny \"Pacman\" Pacquiao]], who just became the new IBO (International Boxing Organization) and ''Ring Magazine'' Light Welterweight Champion, was held at the Renaissance Hotel in [[Makati City]], in partnership with [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] Solar and [[GMA Network|GMA]] executives at that time signed for a partnership in TV coverage of Manny Pacquiao's upcoming boxing matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/photos/1295/gma-victory-party-for-manny-pac-man-pacquiao|title=GMA victory party for Manny 'Pac-Man' Pacquiao|author=|date=|work=PEP.ph|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe C/S cable channel was later rebranded as [[C/S Origin]] in September 2008, while the RPN network later changed its branding to [[C/S 9]] the next month.\n\nOn November 29, 2009, Solar rebranded C/S9 as [[Solar TV]] at 11:00 am with a slogan ''It's A Bright New World'' on RPN.

In February 2012, both services aired a promotion, announcing the split of CHASE and TGC to form themselves as separate channels. On February 15, 2012, The Game Channel finally shuts down on free TV and was relaunched as a cable channel; CHASE was also relaunched as a separate channel, now occupying the entire BEAM broadcast airtime on Free TV.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Solar transferred its former Salcedo Village facilities to their new facility in Worldwide Corporate Center in [[Mandaluyong|Mandaluyong City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2012/04/solar-news-update-debuts-new-look.html|title=Solar News Update debuts new look|website=Medianewser.com}}</ref> It also featured a newly constructed set for Solar's then-news division, which would become fully functional three months later.\n\nOn July 16, 2012, Solar News launched its first local newscast ''Solar Network News'', followed by ''Solar Nightly News'', an hourly Solar News Update, Solar Daybreak, and Solar Newsday.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, Jack TV plugged their announcement through CHASE programs bearing the title \"Another Jack TV is rising, coming soon on this channel\" (BEAM Channel 31). This indicated that CHASE was being replaced; finally, on October 20, 2012, Jack City was then launched, marking October 19 as the end of CHASE's broadcasts. [[Jack City]] still does carry some of CHASE's programs however.\n\nIn October 2012, it was found out that Solar News would replace the government-controlled RPN News, as a result of RPN's privatization, making Solar TV covering the entire network's airtime. More than 200 RPN employees, particularly those from the labor union and the NewsWatch staff, were retrenched and RPN News was closed down on October 29, effectively axing NewsWatch and NewsCap. Some retrenched government employees were relocated to either [[People's Television Network|People's Television Network (PTV 4)]] or [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC 13)]] (both State-run broadcasters).\n\n[[File:FvfOmbudsman0222 37.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A [[Toyota HiAce]] van used by Solar News parked at the Office of the Ombudsman.]]\nOn October 30, 2012, at 5:45 am, TalkTV was replaced as Solar News Channel on Channel 21 via [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]]. The channel saw the relaunch of sports news program ''Solar Sports Desk'' (now known as [[Sports Desk (2004 TV series)|CNN Philippines Sports Desk]]), as well as the initial telecast of the Solar News and Current affairs block in November 2012 comprising five public affairs programs ([[Legal Help Desk|Legal HD]], [[MedTalk]], [[News.PH]], [[Opposing Views]], Elections 2013 and [[News Cafe]]), ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Undercover Boss (U.S. TV series)|Undercover Boss]]'' and the \"Stories\" [[documentary film|documentaries]] block. In January 2013, Solar News Cebuano (now known as [[CNN Philippines Cebuano News]]) made history as the first national newscast delivered in a local dialect. In 2014, it also launched the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] national newscast, [[Kapampangan News]] and the public service program ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]'', which is shown in [[Filipino language]].\n\nPrior to the channel's transfer to RPN, SNC's flagship newscast (Solar Network News) simulcasted on RPN 9 (free TV only) from the SNC's launch. The news content for RPN (then affiliated with ETC), however, was switched to ''Solar Nightly News'' on January 14, 2013, onwards, to avoid backlash from free TV viewers, particularly Free TV viewers of ''[[American Idol]]'' (in which the original plan was to replace the 6 pm via satellite broadcast to Free TV viewers by Network News, then airs the AI episodes at the 8 pm rerun in simulcast with cable and satellite viewers). Throughout the ''American Idol'' season, as the episodes are repeated at 8 PM on cable, Solar used the separate free TV-only feed, that contains reruns of selected ETC shows (but with advertisements replaced by ETC teasers and promotions) at 8&nbsp;pm and ''Nightly News'' at 9 PM (with additional ETC programs, if necessary) to be used by RPN after each AI via satellite episode before RPN returns to the main ETC feed at 10 PM. This is to retain RPN's news content as it then has no newscast since the axing of NewsWatch.\n\nOn January 3, 2013, SEC launched Blink Cinema (later renamed as [[My Movie Channel]]) with the full broadcast taking effect later that month.\n\nOn April 14, 2013, [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5 Network Inc.]] and Solar Entertainment Corporation joined to broadcast the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]] in Manila on Philippine television on August 1\u201311. Aside from [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and its sister channel ([[AksyonTV]]), the games were also broadcast over Solar\u2019s cable channel [[Basketball TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/tv5-solar-team-up-for-2013-fiba-asia-championship-coverage|title=TV5, Solar team up for 2013 FIBA Asia Championship coverage - InterAksyon.com - Sports5|author=|date=|work=InterAksyon.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===New management===\nOn May 22, 2013, Solar Entertainment Corporation appointed two officers to manage its broadcasting and cable businesses: Manuel \u201cMeckoy\u201d Quiogue as chief commercial officer and Maria Theresa \u201cMitos\u201d Borromeo as chief operating officer (COO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.ph/lifestyle/2013/05/22/solar-entertainment-corp.-appoints-2-new-officers|title=9news.ph - 9news Resources and Information.|author=|date=|work=9news.ph|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> However, Quiogue suddenly died on May 31, 2013 prior to assuming his position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=73221|title=Your life is your message to the world|work=BWorldOnline.com|access-date=April 6, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221542/http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=73221|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 28, 2013, [[Jack City]] reduced its free TV broadcast to 18 hours a day on BEAM in compliance with the [[National Telecommunications Commission]]'s guidelines.

As a result of this ownership change, STVNI, Solar News Channel and RPN's majority stake were separated from the Tiengs; while ETC, 2nd Avenue, and Jack City reverted to Solar Entertainment's ownership.\n\nOn September 1, 2014, [[Jack City]] ended its run on free TV due to the preparations being made by [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media|BEAM 31]] for the incoming transition to ISDB-T digital television, though it continues to be broadcast as a separate cable channel. However, Jack City continued to broadcast on cable networks until March 21, 2015. After Jack City's closure to free TV, BEAM aired under blocktime programs from various local production and religious companies. On November 15, 2014, BEAM began being carried on [[SkyCable]] and Destiny Cable subscribers (per compliance with NTC's \"must-carry\" basis). This move resulted of Jack City in a change of its channel assignment for SkyCable and [[Destiny Cable]] subscribers, as well as several pay TV companies.\n\nIn 2015, Solar Entertainment Corporation launched the #1stonPHTV brand of Solar channels for [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Jack TV]], Jack City and [[My Movie Channel]], with the brand implemented on January 6, 2015. Since then, all SEC channels broadcast first-run foreign television programs with the hashtag #1stonPHTV (First on Philippine TV), which was formerly known as \"Match Airing\" (ETC), \"Playing 1st\" (Jack TV), \"The Newest in the US\" and \"FastCast\" (2nd Avenue) and \"See It First\" (Jack City).\n\n[[The Game Channel]], after almost three years on broadcasting, selling or ceased on February 28, 2015. The channel space was taken over by [[My Movie Channel]] on March 1.\n\nOn March 22, 2015, Jack City was replaced by [[CT (TV channel)|CT]], thus becoming independent from its parent network. Upon launch, the channel broadened its programming focus by adding talk shows, sitcoms and men's lifestyle programs to its roster.\n\nOn March 26, 2015, Solar Entertainment announced its broadcast of the \"Fight Of The Century\" between [[Manny Pacquiao]] and [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] on May 3, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/2015/03/27/1437964/abs-cbn-gma-tv5-join-hands-air-pacquiao-fight-networks-unite-historic|title=ABS-CBN, GMA, TV5 join hands to air Pacquiao fight: Networks unite for historic broadcast|first=Abac|last=Cordero|date=March 27, 2015|work=PhilStar.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> As stated in a press conference that day, it was broadcast on May 3 via delayed broadcast in three major television stations in the Philippines, [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], and [[GMA Network]] (who waived its exclusive contract with Solar to allow its multi-network coverage, but maintained its exclusive live broadcast on its radio division), with [[Solar Sports]] as its main content provider for this historic event in boxing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/88062-pacquiao-mayweather-television-broadcast-ph|title=Pacquiao vs Mayweather to be televised by GMA, ABS-CBN and TV5|author=|date=|work=Rappler.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/459458/sports/boxing/pacquiao-mayweather-fight-to-air-live-over-gma-radio-stations-nationwide|title=Pacquiao-Mayweather fight to air live over GMA radio stations nationwide|author=|date=|work=GMANetwork.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2015, My Movie Channel ceased broadcasting. The closure or selling was announced by Solar a day before.\n\n===Rebranding of the four flagship networks===\nOn October 16, 2016, Solar relaunched its flagship channels ETC, 2nd Avenue, Basketball TV and Solar Sports. The four networks unveiled their new logos, on-air graphics and station IDs, which took effect on that day. CT, Jack TV, Shop TV and NBA Premium TV on the other hand remains unchanged. Also that day, Solar launched its corporate campaign slogan ''...There's More To Come'', which evolved in 2017 as ''We go for More''.\n\nIn 2017, Solar Entertainment became the official Philippine broadcaster of the 65th edition of the [[Miss Universe]] in Manila. This led to another deal with [[ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]] (the second time that such deal happened between Solar and the Big 3 networks). According to some sources, a directive from [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Duterte]] ordered that the major networks must cover the prestige pageant as it happens live in the [[Philippines]]. Alongside the Big Three, Solar Entertainment channels [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|etc]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Jack TV]] and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] aired the pageant simultaneously. It was also in the same year when Solar Entertainment forged a joint venture with the Bermuda-based communications satellite company [[Asia Broadcast Satellite]] to launch the first nationwide free-to-air [[Satellite television#Direct broadcast via satellite|direct-to-home]] satellite television services using the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]], which is set to launch on the 3rd quarter of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/broadcasting/2017/05/22/abs-solar-group-launch-new-dth-service-philippines/|title=ABS, The Solar Group to Launch New DTH Service in the Philippines|author=Kendall Russell|date=May 22, 2017|work=Satellite Today|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Carriage disputes==\n===Sky Cable===\n====2008====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSolar's channels have ceased airing on [[Sky Cable]], the Philippines' largest cable television provider. An insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that these troubles with Sky Cable started when boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]], whose fights Solar Entertainment has the exclusive right to air and distribute to, moved from [[ABS-CBN]], the flagship television network of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and the primary owner of [[Sky Cable Corporation]], to rival [[GMA Network]]. Another insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that SkyCable wanted to remove [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and [[Jack TV]] to make room for their own channels, [[Velvet (TV channel)|Velvet]] (now defunct) and [[Maxxx]] (now defunct). Sky Cable wanted to retain [[C/S]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Solar Sports]] and [[Basketball TV]], but Solar made a decision that they would only renew their contract if Sky Cable carried all six channels. Thus, Solar decided to pull out all their channels rather than remove ETC and Jack TV.\n\nHowever, Solar has signed a deal with local terrestrial channels [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC]], [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] and [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|RJTV]] for block-time programming. C/S, ETC and 2nd Avenue programming are seen on terrestrial TV channels RPN, SBN and RJTV, respectively, while [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[WWE]] programming were seen on TV5, now moved to RPN (WWE programming are currently being broadcast thru TV5, while its terrestrial NBA coverage were moved to [[ABS-CBN Sports]] under Solar).\n\nMost of its channels were later returned to Sky Cable, while Jack TV would eventually return to its lineup on January 1, 2010 replacing Maxxx.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacquiao's boxing promotion, [[Top Rank]], signed a non-guaranteed contract with [[ABS-CBN Sports]] to exclusively air fights promoted by Top Rank, with the exception of Pacquiao fights which are still signed exclusively through Solar Entertainment.\n\n====2017\u201319====\nOn April 10, 2017, 3 days before the [[2017 NBA Playoffs]] was scheduled to begin (and coincided with the final day of the [[2016\u201317 NBA season|2016\u201317 NBA regular season]]), Basketball TV, [[NBA Premium TV]], Solar Sports, Jack TV and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] (now defunct) were removed by Solar from Sky Cable (including [[Sky Direct]], [[Destiny Cable]] & [[Sky On Demand]] thru video on demand) without any prior announcement from Solar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/167065-sky-nba-premium-btv-unavailable |title=Sky subscribers frustrated as NBA Premium, BTV unavailable for playoffs start |last= Rola|first=Alyssa |date= April 16, 2017|website=[[Rappler]] |access-date= April 16, 2017|quote=}}</ref> Initially, both Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV were replaced by airing a simulcast of [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]] with a ticker announcing the unavailability of the channels, with Solar Sports, Jack TV and CT (now defunct) also doing the latter albeit with a black screen. Later, almost all of the pulled-out Solar channels were replaced by an imaging card, initially detailing the unavailability of the channels and then later, announcing that they will discuss with Solar on returning the aforementioned channels; while for BTV and NBA Premium TV, a schedule of the NBA games that will air on [[ABS-CBN]], ABS-CBN Sports and Action and [[Fox Sports Asia|Fox Sports]] within the week and a loop of an NBA promo. Solar did not comment on the situation for the removal of the channels, but sources and some netizens pointed out a carriage dispute between the two parties for not paying an undisclosed price to continue broadcasting these channels, which was later proven true by an article published by the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''.\n\nAs the dispute continued, some media enthusiasts and netizens raised concerns of whether these Solar channels will return to Sky and/or Destiny. Others pointed that inaction between the two parties could affect the next long-term local broadcast franchise with the NBA, slated to begin at the Association's 2019-2020 regular season. (Currently, Solar and Sky's parent, ABS-CBN, have a shared broadcast agreement to air the NBA games on pay and terrestrial television, respectively. Rumours circulated that both networks may bid separately, if they could not reach renewal, and use their respective infrastructure to broadcast adequate NBA coverage; otherwise, rival networks with a functioning sports department like [[5 (TV channel)|The 5 Network]] may also seek their own bidding to steal the 2019 contract from both Solar and ABS-CBN.)\n\nNetizens and viewers were dismayed and frustrated by the removal of the said channels by Sky Cable, most notably for BTV and NBA Premium due to the importance of the Playoffs. Some netizens were angered by the removal of the said channels and asked Sky Cable to return the channels before the scheduled Playoffs would begin, however Sky Cable would respond to angered netizens on social media that they are \"fixing the situation with Solar\". Other netizens and viewers would otherwise switch providers from Sky Cable to other cable companies that carried these channels or to other satellite providers like [[Cignal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/news/sky-cable-nba-premium-basketball-tv-negotiations-with-solar |title=SKYcable unable to give timetable for return of NBA Premium, Basketball TV to channel lineup |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=April 15, 2017 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=April 16, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 2018, Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV returned to Sky Cable, Sky Direct, & Sky On Demand for the first time in 18 months<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-btv-channels-back-on-skycable-per-advisory-a795-20181016 |title=NBA Premium, BTV channels back on SKYCable, per advisory |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=October 16, 2018 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=October 26, 2018 |quote=}}</ref>; however it was later removed on October 28, 2018 for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mysky.com.ph/MetroManila/updates/1031/2018/10/28/sky-advisory|title=SKY Advisory|website=Me & My SKY: SKY at 25 years}}</ref>\n\nThe carriage dispute officially ended on January 1, 2019 when all Solar channels: Basketball TV, NBA Premium TV, Solar Sports, and Jack TV were restored on Sky Cable (including Sky On Demand & Sky Direct).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-and-btv-are-back-in-skycable-s-channel-lineup-a795-20190101|title=NBA Premium and BTV are back in SKYcable's channel lineup|website=Spin.ph}}</ref>\n\nIronically, [[MTVph]], which is a Solar channel, ended its operations on the same day at that time Sky returned the affected Solar channels. As of 2019, Sky Cable's sister company Destiny Cable still does not carry all the aforementioned Solar channels despite its aforementioned return on Sky Cable.\n\nDuring the aforementioned period, [[Shop TV]], ETC and 2nd Avenue (now defunct) were kept on the air, due to the \"must-carry\" rules by the NTC. MTVph was also kept on the air (until it was discontinued on January 1, 2019) since it was carried in a separate programming agreement outside of the affected channels despite its ownership.\n\n===Dream Satellite TV===\n[[Dream Satellite TV]] ceased carrying three Solar Channels, namely [[Solar Sports]], [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] (which was at that time a cable channel prior to its move to free TV and cable) and [[2nd Avenue (TV channel)|2nd Avenue]] (now defunct) (except [[C/S 9]]) effective 1 February 2009. Dream's carriage contract with Solar Entertainment, which expired on 31 December 2008 was not renewed by Dream, citing financial constraints as its main reason. The three Solar channels were replaced by A&E's [[History (South East Asian TV channel)|The History Channel]], [[Bio. (South East Asia)|Biography Channel]] and [[Crime & Investigation Network (South East Asia)|Crime and Investigation Channel]]. As of 2017, ETC and 2nd Avenue remained on its lineup due to the \"must-carry\" rules of the NTC. \n\nUnfortunately, Dream Satellite ended its operations on December 31, 2017 due to bankruptcy and its competition with other satellite providers.\n\n==Divisions / Subsidiaries==\n* ETC Productions<!-- ETC Productions is a production arm of the female-oriented TV channel, ETC -->\n* Blink\n* Solar Pictures\n* Domestic Satellite Philippines, Inc.

He is also known for the [[Taxil hoax]], a spurious expos\u00e9 of [[Freemasonry]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s opposition to it.\n\n==Early life==\nMarie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pag\u00e8s was born in [[Marseille]], and at the age of five, he was placed into a [[Jesuit]] seminary. After spending his childhood years in the seminary, he became disillusioned with the Catholic faith and began to see the religious ideology as socially harmful.\n\n==La Bible amusante==\nTaxil first became known for writing [[Anti-clericalism|anti-Clerical]] or [[anti-Catholic]] books,<ref>Robin Waterfield, Rene Guenon and the Future of the West, Published, 1987, p.32-36 {{ISBN|1597310190}}</ref> notably ''[[La Bible amusante]]'' (''The Amusing Bible'') and ''La Vie de Jesus'' (''The Life of Jesus''), in which Taxil satirically pointed out inconsistencies, errors, and false beliefs presented in these religious works. In his other books ''Les D\u00e9bauches d'un confesseur'' (''Debauchery of a Confessor'', with Karl Milo), ''Les Pornographes sacr\u00e9s: la confession et les confesseurs'' (''Sacred Pornographs: confession and confessors''), and ''Les Ma\u00eetresses du Pape'' (''The Pope's Mistresses''), Taxil portrays leaders of the Catholic Church as hedonistic creatures exploring their fetishes in the manner of the [[Marquis de Sade]]. In 1879, he was tried at the Seine [[Cour d'assises|Assizes]] for writing a pamphlet ''A Bas la Calotte'' (\"Down with the Cloth\"), which was accused of insulting a religion recognized by the state, but he was acquitted.\n\n==The Taxil hoax==\n{{main|Taxil hoax}}\nIn 1885, he professed conversion to Catholicism, was solemnly received into the church, and renounced his earlier works. In the 1890s, he wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing [[Freemasonry]],<ref name=HC>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, August 1, 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell</ref> charging their lodges with worshiping the devil and alleging that Diana Vaughan had written for him her confessions of the Satanic \"[[Palladist]]\" cult. The book had great sales among Catholics, although Diana Vaughan never appeared in public. In 1892, Taxil also began to publish a paper, ''La France chr\u00e9tienne anti-ma\u00e7onnique (Christian Antimasonic France)'', with his staunch anti-Masonic publishing friend, [[Abel Clarin de la Rive]].<ref name=IIT>Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry? Authors: de Hoyos, Arturo and Morris, S. Brent, 1988, 2nd edition, p. 27-36, Leo Taxil: The Hoax of Luciferian Masonry {{ISBN|1590771532}}</ref> In 1887, he had an audience with [[Pope Leo XIII]], who rebuked the [[Diocese of Charleston|bishop of Charleston]] for denouncing the [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] confessions as a fraud and, in 1896, sent his blessing to an anti-Masonic Congress of [[Trento|Trent]].<ref>Story of Freemasonry \n by W. G. Sibley, p. 35, Kessinger Publishing, LLC (April 1, 1996), {{ISBN|1564598225}}</ref>\n\nDoubts about Vaughan's veracity and even her existence began to grow, and finally, Taxil promised to produce her at a lecture to be delivered by him on 19 April 1897. To the amazement of the audience (which included a number of [[priest]]s), he announced that Diana was one of a series of hoaxes.<ref name=HC/><ref name=IIT/> He had begun, he said, by persuading the commandant of Marseille that the harbor was infested with sharks, and a ship was sent to destroy them. Next, he invented an underwater city in [[Lake Geneva]], drawing tourists and archaeologists to the spot. He thanked the bishops and Catholic newspapers for facilitating his crowning hoax, namely his conversion, which had exposed the anti-Masonic fanaticism of many Catholics.

He is also known for the [[Taxil hoax]], a spurious expos\u00e9 of [[Freemasonry]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s opposition to it.\n\n==Early life==\nMarie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pag\u00e8s was born in [[Marseille]], and at the age of five, he was placed into a [[Jesuit]] seminary. After spending his childhood years in the seminary, he became disillusioned with the Catholic faith and began to see the religious ideology as socially harmful.\n\n==La Bible amusante==\nTaxil first became known for writing [[Anti-clericalism|anti-Clerical]] or [[anti-Catholic]] books,<ref>Robin Waterfield, Rene Guenon and the Future of the West, Published, 1987, p.32-36 {{ISBN|1597310190}}</ref> notably ''[[La Bible amusante]]'' (''The Amusing Bible'') and ''La Vie de Jesus'' (''The Life of Jesus''), in which Taxil satirically pointed out inconsistencies, errors, and false beliefs presented in these religious works. In his other books ''Les D\u00e9bauches d'un confesseur'' (''Debauchery of a Confessor'', with Karl Milo), ''Les Pornographes sacr\u00e9s: la confession et les confesseurs'' (''Sacred Pornographs: confession and confessors''), and ''Les Ma\u00eetresses du Pape'' (''The Pope's Mistresses''), Taxil portrays leaders of the Catholic Church as hedonistic creatures exploring their fetishes in the manner of the [[Marquis de Sade]]. In 1879, he was tried at the Seine [[Cour d'assises|Assizes]] for writing a pamphlet ''A Bas la Calotte'' (\"Down with the Cloth\"), which was accused of insulting a religion recognized by the state, but he was acquitted.\n\n==The Taxil hoax==\n{{main|Taxil hoax}}\nIn 1885, he professed conversion to Catholicism, was solemnly received into the church, and renounced his earlier works. In the 1890s, he wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing [[Freemasonry]],<ref name=HC>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Mysteries of the Freemasons: America'', video documentary, August 1, 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell</ref> charging their lodges with worshiping the devil and alleging that Diana Vaughan had written for him her confessions of the Satanic \"[[Palladist]]\" cult. The book had great sales among Catholics, although Diana Vaughan never appeared in public. In 1892, Taxil also began to publish a paper, ''La France chr\u00e9tienne anti-ma\u00e7onnique (Christian Antimasonic France)'', with his staunch anti-Masonic publishing friend, [[Abel Clarin de la Rive]].<ref name=IIT>Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry?

To the amazement of the audience (which included a number of [[priest]]s), he announced that Diana was one of a series of hoaxes.<ref name=HC/><ref name=IIT/> He had begun, he said, by persuading the commandant of Marseille that the harbor was infested with sharks, and a ship was sent to destroy them. Next, he invented an underwater city in [[Lake Geneva]], drawing tourists and archaeologists to the spot. He thanked the bishops and Catholic newspapers for facilitating his crowning hoax, namely his conversion, which had exposed the anti-Masonic fanaticism of many Catholics. Diana Vaughan was revealed to be a simple typist in his employ, who laughingly allowed her name to be used by him.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nThe audience received these revelations with indignation and contempt.

Their current home The Creek used to be the site of the Port of Bristol Authority Sports & Social Club but when they moved to new premises 1965, Manor Farm took it over. The pitch at the Creek was once notorious for its sloping surface but work has been undertaken in recent years to eliminate the slope. With seating and floodlights added since 1980, the club now boasts excellent facilities alongside a spacious clubhouse.\n \nHaving a permanent base enabled the club to apply successfully to join the Somerset Senior League where they were to progress rapidly through the divisions before deciding to advance further to the Western League in 1977.\n \nThe club joined the First Division for the 1977/78 season and remained there until the 1982/83 season when they won the First Division championship and gained promotion to the Premier Division. They remained there until relegation under Pete McCall's management team in 2001/02 but regained their Premier status just two seasons later in 2003/04 under Shaun Bond and Nicky Johns. In 1983/84 they reached the final of the G.F.A. Challenge Trophy where they lost to then Hellenic League side [[Shortwood United]]. The trophy did make its way to the Creek in 1987/88 and has been won on a further three occasions by the club.\n \n \nMain stand at The Creek.\nThe 2011/12 season saw the club win its first double when they took both the GFA Challenge Trophy and the Toolstation League Les Phillips League Cup back to Sea Mills.\n \nLee Lashenko become the new manager at the start of the 2013/14 season and quickly made an impact in the [[FA Cup]], overcoming [[Oldland Abbotonians F.C.|Oldland Abootonians]], [[Lymington Town F.C.|Lymington Town]] and [[Corsham Town]] to reach the Second Qualifying Round, equaling their best ever performance in the competition. Unfortunately, they were unable to go one better and lost to [[Bridgwater Town]] 1-2 in a replay at Fairfax Park. The club continued to fight for top spot in the league and applied for promotion. The club finished second but were unsuccessful in their promotion bid when [[Larkhall Athletic F.C.|Larkhall Athletic]] were accepted into the Southern League. The second-placed finish was the best in the club's history. It also saw the team break the club records for the most goals scored in a season and the fewest goals conceded.\n \nThe 2015/16 season left the club with mixed feelings as on one hand they managed to get to the Quarter-Final of the [[FA Vase]] narrowly going out away to eventual winners [[Morpeth Town]]. On the other hand, whilst they finished 3rd in the Western League, again they just missed out on promotion to the Southern League by one place. They did, however, win the GFA County Challenge Trophy for the second time in succession and the fourth time overall with a record 9-2 win over [[Lydney Town F.C.|Lydney Town]].\n \nIn the 2016/17 season, Bristol Manor Farm were finally successful in gaining promotion to the Southern League, winning the Western League by quite a distance. They also had another successful run in the FA Vase where they went out in the Fifth Round Proper to Semi-Finalists [[Bromsgrove Sporting F.C.|Bromsgrove Sporting]].\n \nThe Farm finished their first season in the eighth tier with a very respectable 9th-place finish, falling away towards the end after troubling the top six places all season.\n\n== Staff ==\n \n*'''First team manager''': Lee Lashenko\n*'''Assistant manager''': Iain Harvey\n*'''Physio''': Stephen Carter\n*'''Coach(s)''': Chris Bailes, Terry Buffrey, [[Mike Mahoney (footballer)|Mike Mahoney]]\n\n== Club rivals ==\nBristol Manor Farm's main rivals are considered to be [[Yate Town F.C.|Yate Town]] and [[Mangotsfield United F.C.|Mangotsfield United]], both from the northern outskirts of Bristol. With all three clubs playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League Division One]] since 2017, fixtures among the three have been seen by some fans as a contest to claim the title of

They are currently members of the {{English football updater|BristoMF}} and play at The Creek. The club is affiliated to the [[Gloucestershire County FA]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Creek, Bristol Manor Farm.jpg|alt=|thumb|400x400px|Bristol Manor Farm's ground, The Creek, in 2015]]\nBristol Manor Farm Football Club was formed for the 1960/61 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bristolmanorfarm.com/history.php|title=Club History|publisher=Bristol Manor Farm FC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708094805/http://www.bristolmanorfarm.com/history.php|archive-date=2011-07-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> After just one season, the club was disbanded but was reformed and began playing again in the 1962/63 season. Their current home The Creek used to be the site of the Port of Bristol Authority Sports & Social Club but when they moved to new premises 1965, Manor Farm took it over. The pitch at the Creek was once notorious for its sloping surface but work has been undertaken in recent years to eliminate the slope. With seating and floodlights added since 1980, the club now boasts excellent facilities alongside a spacious clubhouse.\n \nHaving a permanent base enabled the club to apply successfully to join the Somerset Senior League where they were to progress rapidly through the divisions before deciding to advance further to the Western League in 1977.\n \nThe club joined the First Division for the 1977/78 season and remained there until the 1982/83 season when they won the First Division championship and gained promotion to the Premier Division. They remained there until relegation under Pete McCall's management team in 2001/02 but regained their Premier status just two seasons later in 2003/04 under Shaun Bond and Nicky Johns. In 1983/84 they reached the final of the G.F.A. Challenge Trophy where they lost to then Hellenic League side [[Shortwood United]]. The trophy did make its way to the Creek in 1987/88 and has been won on a further three occasions by the club.\n \n \nMain stand at The Creek.\nThe 2011/12 season saw the club win its first double when they took both the GFA Challenge Trophy and the Toolstation League Les Phillips League Cup back to Sea Mills.\n \nLee Lashenko become the new manager at the start of the 2013/14 season and quickly made an impact in the [[FA Cup]], overcoming [[Oldland Abbotonians F.C.|Oldland Abootonians]], [[Lymington Town F.C.|Lymington Town]] and [[Corsham Town]] to reach the Second Qualifying Round, equaling their best ever performance in the competition. Unfortunately, they were unable to go one better and lost to [[Bridgwater Town]] 1-2 in a replay at Fairfax Park. The club continued to fight for top spot in the league and applied for promotion. The club finished second but were unsuccessful in their promotion bid when [[Larkhall Athletic F.C.|Larkhall Athletic]] were accepted into the Southern League. The second-placed finish was the best in the club's history. It also saw the team break the club records for the most goals scored in a season and the fewest goals conceded.\n \nThe 2015/16 season left the club with mixed feelings as on one hand they managed to get to the Quarter-Final of the [[FA Vase]] narrowly going out away to eventual winners [[Morpeth Town]]. On the other hand, whilst they finished 3rd in the Western League, again they just missed out on promotion to the Southern League by one place. They did, however, win the GFA County Challenge Trophy for the second time in succession and the fourth time overall with a record 9-2 win over [[Lydney Town F.C.|Lydney Town]].\n \nIn the 2016/17 season, Bristol Manor Farm were finally successful in gaining promotion to the Southern League, winning the Western League by quite a distance. They also had another successful run in the FA Vase where they went out in the Fifth Round Proper to Semi-Finalists [[Bromsgrove Sporting F.C.|Bromsgrove Sporting]].\n \nThe Farm finished their first season in the eighth tier with a very respectable 9th-place finish, falling away towards the end after troubling the top six places all season.\n\n== Staff ==\n \n*'''First team manager''': Lee Lashenko\n*'''Assistant manager''': Iain Harvey\n*'''Physio''': Stephen Carter\n*'''Coach(s)''': Chris Bailes, Terry Buffrey, [[Mike Mahoney (footballer)|Mike Mahoney]]\n\n== Club rivals ==\nBristol Manor Farm's main rivals are considered to be [[Yate Town F.C.|Yate Town]] and [[Mangotsfield United F.C.|Mangotsfield United]], both from the northern outskirts of Bristol. With all three clubs playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League Division One]] since 2017, fixtures among the three have been seen by some fans as a contest to claim the title of Bristol's third club and tend to attract higher than usual attendances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mufc-online.co.uk/teams/32267/match-centre/1-2862155|title=Bristol Manor Farm 3 vs. 1 Mangotsfield

New York: Penguin Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y77BAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA274 p. 272.]</ref> a spandrel that curves across a right angle to support a dome. Robert Mark, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton, offered his expertise in the pages of ''[[American Scientist]]'', noting that these definitions are often misunderstood in [[architectural theory]]. Mark concluded, \"Gould and Lewontin's misapplication of the term spandrel for pendentive perhaps implies a wider latitude of design choice than they intended for their analogy. But Dennett's critique of the architectural basis of the analogy goes even further astray because he slights the technical rationale of the architectural elements in question.\"<ref name=\"MarkSpandrel\"/>\n\n===Evolutionary progress===\nGould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term \"[[Largest-scale trends in evolution|progress]]\". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a [[March of Progress (illustration)|ladder of progress]], leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards [[complexity]], but towards [[biodiversity|diversification]]. Because life is constrained to begin with a [[abiogenesis|simple starting point]] (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, as is often the case with [[parasitism|parasites]].<ref name=FullHouse>Gould, S. J. (1996). ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin]]. New York: Harmony Books.</ref>\n\nIn a review of ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] approved of Gould's general argument, but suggested that he saw evidence of a \"tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the-wool, indispensably progressive.\"<ref>{{Citation |doi=10.2307/2411179 |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |year=1997 |title=Human chauvinism |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml |journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=1015\u20131020 |postscript=. |jstor=2411179 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601215949/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml |archivedate=June 1, 2008  }}</ref>\n\n===Cultural evolution===\nGould's arguments towards progress in evolutionary biology did not extend towards a notion of progress in general or notions of [[cultural evolution]]. In ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]'', Gould compares two notions of progress against one another. While the first concept of progress, evolutionary progress, is argued to be invalid for a number of biological considerations, Gould permits that evolution may operate in human cultural evolution through a [[Lamarckism#In sociocultural evolution|Lamarckian]] mechanism. Gould goes on to argue that the disappearance of the 0.400 [[batting average]] in baseball is paradoxically due to the inclusion of better players in the league, rather than players becoming worse over time. In his view such a process is likely reflective in a number of cultural phenomena including sports, the visual arts, and music where, unlike in biological systems, the realm of aesthetic possibilities is constrained by a \"right wall\" of human limits and aesthetic preferences.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Gould |first=Jay |interviewer=[[Michael Krasny (talk show host)]] |title=Stephen Jay Gould |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |publisher=Mother Jones Magazine|location=San Francisco |date=January 1997}}</ref> Gould later goes on to state that his arguments for biological evolution should not be applied to cultural change lest they be employed by, \"so-called \u2018political correctness\u2019 as a doctrine that celebrates all indigenous practice, and therefore permits no distinctions, judgements, or analyses.\"<ref name=FullHouse/>\n\n===Cladistics===\nGould never embraced [[cladistics]] as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with [[Derek Briggs]], who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the [[Burgess Shale]] fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils.<ref>Gould, S.

He focused his early work on the [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] genus [[Bermuda Land Snail|''Poecilozonites'']], while his later work concentrated on the [[Caribbean|West Indian]] genus ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''. According to Gould \"''Cerion'' is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one.

It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals\u2014very different from my popular science writings\u2014but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life.\"<ref>de Mythe, Johannes (2000).

Hilversum, Netherlands.</ref>\n\n===As a public figure===\nGould became widely known through his popular essays on [[evolution]] in the ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled ''This View of Life'' (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'') from January 1974 to January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays.<ref name=tatt/> Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became [[bestseller|bestselling books]] such as ''[[Ever Since Darwin]]'' and ''[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb]]'', ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', and ''[[The Flamingo's Smile]]''.\n\nA passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]]. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and [[sabermetrician]] (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book ''Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville'' (2003).<ref name=\"mudville\"/>\n\nAlthough a self-described Darwinist, Gould's emphasis was less [[gradualism|gradualist]] and [[reductionism|reductionist]] than most [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinists]]. He fiercely opposed many aspects of [[sociobiology]] and its intellectual descendant [[evolutionary psychology]]. He devoted considerable time to fighting against [[creationism]], [[creation science]], and [[intelligent design]]. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]''. Gould later developed the term \"non-overlapping magisteria\" (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion should not comment on each other's realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books ''Rocks of Ages'' (1999) and ''The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox'' (2003). In a 1982 essay for ''Natural History'' Gould wrote:\n\n{{quote|Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people. The answers will not be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, arise from the data of science.

They wrote in comment on two NYRB articles by Gould (June 12 and 26).\n\n:John Maynard Smith, one of the world's leading evolutionary biologists, recently summarized in the NYRB the sharply conflicting assessments of Stephen Jay Gould: \"Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the pre-eminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists.\" (NYRB, November 30, 1995, p. 46). No one can take any pleasure in the evident pain Gould is experiencing now that his actual standing within the community of professional evolutionary biologists is finally becoming more widely known. If what was a stake was solely one man's self-regard, common decency would preclude comment.\n\n:But as Maynard Smith points out, more is at stake. Gould \"is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory\"\u2014or as Ernst Mayr says of Gould and his small group of allies\u2014they \"quite conspicuously misrepresent the views of [biology's] leading spokesmen.\"{{ref|a}} Indeed, although Gould characterizes his critics as \"anonymous\" and \"a tiny coterie,\" nearly every major evolutionary biologist of our era has weighed in a vain attempt to correct the tangle of confusions that the higher profile Gould has inundated the intellectual world with.{{ref|b}} The point is not that Gould is the object of some criticism\u2014so properly are we all\u2014it is that his reputation as a credible and balanced authority about evolutionary biology is non-existent among those who are in a professional position to know.\n\n:1.{{note|a}} Mayr, Ernst (1988) ''Toward a new philosophy of biology''.

Sterelny documents their disagreements over theoretical issues, including the prominence of [[gene selection]] in evolution. Dawkins argues that natural selection is best understood as competition among genes (or replicators), while Gould advocated [[Group selection#Multilevel selection theory|multi-level selection]], which includes selection amongst [[gene]]s, [[Transposon|nucleic acid sequences]], [[cell lineage]]s, [[organism]]s, [[deme (biology)|demes]], [[species]], and [[clade]]s.<ref name=\"Sterelny\" />\n\nDawkins accused Gould of deliberately underplaying the differences between rapid [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradualism]] and [[macromutation]] in his published accounts of [[punctuated equilibrium]].<ref>Dawkins, Richard (1998). ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZudTchiioUoC&pg=PA202 pp. 196\u2013197]. \"It is when we ask what happens during the sudden bursts of species formation that the confusion... arises... Gould is aware of the difference between rapid gradualism and macromutation, but he treats the matter as though it were a minor detail, to be cleared up after we have taken on board the overarching question of whether evolution is episodic rather than gradual.\"</ref> He also devoted entire chapters to critiquing Gould's account of evolution in his books ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]'', as did Daniel Dennett in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''.\n\n===Cambrian fauna===\nIn his book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'' (1989) Gould famously described the [[Cambrian]] fauna of the [[Burgess Shale]], emphasizing their bizarre anatomical designs, their sudden appearance, and the role chance played in determining which members survived. He used the Cambrian fauna as an example of the role contingency has in shaping the broader pattern of evolution.\n\nHis view of contingency was criticized by [[Simon Conway Morris]] in his 1998 book ''The Crucible of Creation''.<ref name=Conway1998>{{cite journal |last1=Conway Morris |first1=S. |last2=Gould |first2=S.

Proposed examples include the \"masculinized genitalia in female [[Hyenas#Appearance and biology|hyenas]], exaptive use of an [[Umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]] as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant [[Irish Elk|Irish deer]], and several key features of human mentality.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/20/10750.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.20.10750 |pmid=11038582|pmc=23474 |title=The exaptive excellence of spandrels as a term and prototype |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=94 |issue=20 |pages=10750\u201310755 |year=1997 |last1=Gould |first1=S.

Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is [[Panglossian]] for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental [[Biological constraints|constraints]]. The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in [[evolutionary biology]].<ref>Maynard Smith, John (1995).

New York: Penguin Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y77BAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA274 p. 272.]</ref> a spandrel that curves across a right angle to support a dome. Robert Mark, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton, offered his expertise in the pages of ''[[American Scientist]]'', noting that these definitions are often misunderstood in [[architectural theory]]. Mark concluded, \"Gould and Lewontin's misapplication of the term spandrel for pendentive perhaps implies a wider latitude of design choice than they intended for their analogy. But Dennett's critique of the architectural basis of the analogy goes even further astray because he slights the technical rationale of the architectural elements in question.\"<ref name=\"MarkSpandrel\"/>\n\n===Evolutionary progress===\nGould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term \"[[Largest-scale trends in evolution|progress]]\". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a [[March of Progress (illustration)|ladder of progress]], leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards [[complexity]], but towards [[biodiversity|diversification]]. Because life is constrained to begin with a [[abiogenesis|simple starting point]] (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, as is often the case with [[parasitism|parasites]].<ref name=FullHouse>Gould, S. J. (1996). ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin]]. New York: Harmony Books.</ref>\n\nIn a review of ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] approved of Gould's general argument, but suggested that he saw evidence of a \"tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the-wool, indispensably progressive.\"<ref>{{Citation |doi=10.2307/2411179 |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |year=1997 |title=Human chauvinism |url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml |journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=1015\u20131020 |postscript=. |jstor=2411179 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601215949/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml |archivedate=June 1, 2008  }}</ref>\n\n===Cultural evolution===\nGould's arguments towards progress in evolutionary biology did not extend towards a notion of progress in general or notions of [[cultural evolution]]. In ''[[Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin|Full House]]'', Gould compares two notions of progress against one another. While the first concept of progress, evolutionary progress, is argued to be invalid for a number of biological considerations, Gould permits that evolution may operate in human cultural evolution through a [[Lamarckism#In sociocultural evolution|Lamarckian]] mechanism. Gould goes on to argue that the disappearance of the 0.400 [[batting average]] in baseball is paradoxically due to the inclusion of better players in the league, rather than players becoming worse over time. In his view such a process is likely reflective in a number of cultural phenomena including sports, the visual arts, and music where, unlike in biological systems, the realm of aesthetic possibilities is constrained by a \"right wall\" of human limits and aesthetic preferences.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Gould |first=Jay |interviewer=[[Michael Krasny (talk show host)]] |title=Stephen Jay Gould |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |publisher=Mother Jones Magazine|location=San Francisco |date=January 1997}}</ref> Gould later goes on to state that his arguments for biological evolution should not be applied to cultural change lest they be employed by, \"so-called \u2018political correctness\u2019 as a doctrine that celebrates all indigenous practice, and therefore permits no distinctions, judgements, or analyses.\"<ref name=FullHouse/>\n\n===Cladistics===\nGould never embraced [[cladistics]] as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with [[Derek Briggs]], who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the [[Burgess Shale]] fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils.<ref>Gould, S.

Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics.

He focused his early work on the [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] genus [[Bermuda Land Snail|''Poecilozonites'']], while his later work concentrated on the [[Caribbean|West Indian]] genus ''[[Cerion (gastropod)|Cerion]]''. According to Gould \"''Cerion'' is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ...

Hilversum, Netherlands.</ref>\n\n===As a public figure===\nGould became widely known through his popular essays on [[evolution]] in the ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled ''This View of Life'' (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'') from January 1974 to January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays.<ref name=tatt/> Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became [[bestseller|bestselling books]] such as ''[[Ever Since Darwin]]'' and ''[[The Panda's Thumb (book)|The Panda's Thumb]]'', ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', and ''[[The Flamingo's Smile]]''.\n\nA passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]]. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and [[sabermetrician]] (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book ''Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville'' (2003).<ref name=\"mudville\"/>\n\nAlthough a self-described Darwinist, Gould's emphasis was less [[gradualism|gradualist]] and [[reductionism|reductionist]] than most [[neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinists]]. He fiercely opposed many aspects of [[sociobiology]] and its intellectual descendant [[evolutionary psychology]]. He devoted considerable time to fighting against [[creationism]], [[creation science]], and [[intelligent design]]. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]''. Gould later developed the term \"non-overlapping magisteria\" (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion should not comment on each other's realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books ''Rocks of Ages'' (1999) and ''The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox'' (2003). In a 1982 essay for ''Natural History'' Gould wrote:\n\n{{quote|Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people. The answers will not be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, arise from the data of science.

They wrote in comment on two NYRB articles by Gould (June 12 and 26).\n\n:John Maynard Smith, one of the world's leading evolutionary biologists, recently summarized in the NYRB the sharply conflicting assessments of Stephen Jay Gould: \"Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the pre-eminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists.\" (NYRB, November 30, 1995, p. 46). No one can take any pleasure in the evident pain Gould is experiencing now that his actual standing within the community of professional evolutionary biologists is finally becoming more widely known. If what was a stake was solely one man's self-regard, common decency would preclude comment.\n\n:But as Maynard Smith points out, more is at stake. Gould \"is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory\"\u2014or as Ernst Mayr says of Gould and his small group of allies\u2014they \"quite conspicuously misrepresent the views of [biology's] leading spokesmen.\"{{ref|a}} Indeed, although Gould characterizes his critics as \"anonymous\" and \"a tiny coterie,\" nearly every major evolutionary biologist of our era has weighed in a vain attempt to correct the tangle of confusions that the higher profile Gould has inundated the intellectual world with.{{ref|b}} The point is not that Gould is the object of some criticism\u2014so properly are we all\u2014it is that his reputation as a credible and balanced authority about evolutionary biology is non-existent among those who are in a professional position to know.\n\n:1.{{note|a}} Mayr, Ernst (1988) ''Toward a new philosophy of biology''.

Also, the list of major biologists provided by Tooby and Cosmides may not be fairly represented. E.g., Mayr, Williams, Dawkins, and Coyne have expressed public admiration for Gould as a scientist.\n\n<br />In the first of his two articles that provoked Tooby and Cosmides, Gould had commented on the November 1995 review of his work by Maynard Smith: Gould, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/jun/12/darwinian-fundamentalism/?page=2 \"Darwinian Fundamentalism\"], ''New York Review of Books'' 44 (June 12, 1997): 34\u201337.\n\n:A false fact can be refuted, a false argument exposed; but how can one respond to a purely ad hominem attack?

These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry.\"<ref name=RoA /> He suggests that \"NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism\" and that NOMA is \"a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria.\"<ref name=RoA/>\n\nThis view has not been without criticism, however.

Set in a [[Birmingham|Birmingham, England]] suburb, the film is about a man named Noddy and his girlfriend Kim who operate a [[motorcycle courier]] business. One day Noddy buys a classic [[motorbike]], an 850cc [[Norton Commando]], and restores it. That motorbike, however, is possessed by the evil spirit of a man who was being summoned by an occultist who was killed by a [[motorbike gang]]. Whenever the spirit is overcome by a seeming blood lust, the bike starts up, rides on its own and kills people, particularly members of the [[Hells Angels]]. [[Michael Elphick]] plays Inspector Cleaver and [[Anthony Daniels]] plays the eccentric priest who attempts to exorcise the bike's evil spirit.<ref name=\"mfb\" />\n\n==Plot==\nA [[motorbike gang]] kills an occultist with a crossbow during a satanic ritual. An evil spirit inhabits a damaged bike. Noddy is then seen purchasing that very motorcycle for the price of \u00a31100 from a dealer, but he tells Kim he only paid \u00a3600. He proceeds to take it home and fix, with his friend, Buzzer, and girlfriend, Kim, the damage caused by the crossbow by replacing the fuel tank. Buzzer steals the petrol cap for \"funsies\" but then the bike kills him by decapitation.\n\nIt is revealed to the audience that the vehicle has become a bloodthirsty monster. Noddy goes to the scene of the crime where he meets an inspector who smells like garlic. Later, Noddy has a bad dream that the inspector gives him Buzzer's head in a bag and it talks at him but then he wakes up. Then he goes back to sleep and dreams Buzzer is a poo that jumps in his mouth and starts asking how he is. Noddy wakes up again and is chewing his duvet. Noddy and Kim go to the pub and order a large vodka tonic and a pint of cider. Then ten of the bikers from the beginning come in and shoot the bar with the crossbow. One then offers to show Kim his \"chopper\" while she is playing pool. She declines, claiming not to have brought her magnifying glass. He then proceeds to unsheathe an axe and attack the pool table and moving onto plates, starting a bar wide brawl of 10 bikers against our protagonists. Kim manages to slip out the front and drive the bike round the back of the pub where Noddy jumps on it from the first floor and then gets shot with a crossbow bolt.\n\nThey then have Chinese. When Kim orders garlic prawns, the bike goes mad and drives off with her. It takes her under a bridge, throws her off and makes advances on her, until it notices the crucifix around her neck. It drives off back to the pub where Chopper attempts to steal it but the bike stabs him through the leg with a large metal spike, then launches him at some graffiti artists. It then proceeds to exact its revenge on the rest of the gang, decapitating the majority and leaving only Roach with a bolt inserted into his posterior.\n\nNoddy then finds out Kim has been taken to hospital where she describes the bike's advances with a hollow look in her eyes. It is then seen that the inspector is looking at some heads. Noddy then goes to a priest, who also has a motorcycle. There is then several crucifix wipes as they travel to the garage where the bike is kept. The priest is sarcastic and does not believe Noddy. Not wanting to be taken into the sunlight, the bike uses its brake lever to sever the priest's fingers. Determining the bike is a vampire, the priest decides to do an exorcism. Believing the bike will come back for Kim, the priest gives her a crucifix and garlic. The priest throws a shuriken at a fly whilst planning the exorcism and exclaims \"Right. Let's go kick some bottom!\".\n\nThe vampire bike stops Noddy and the priest on the way home by disabling the bike they are riding, so they decide to call a taxi but instead wait for a bus. It is a race against the sun to get to the vampire bike before nightfall when it will be free to roam once more. During the exorcism, the priest is hit in the head with a wrench and Noddy is blown around the room by a mysterious wind, knocking him into cupboards. The priest is then crucified with a crown of barbed wire. Believing to have successfully vanquished the demon, the priest sprinkles holy water, but that only makes the bike angry, growing spikes and glowing red.\n\nNoddy runs off and steals a police motorcycle, dragging the policeman behind him, who is almost run over by the vampire bike. The bike is chased by a police car, while the priest attempts to explain it to the authorities and Kim is washed, having her garlic removed. The bike evades the police by driving vertically down a wall and goes to the hospital to finish off Kim but not before cleaving the tea lady in two. Kim uses her crucifix to scare it away, so it goes after Roach, passing the priest and inspector in the corridor of the hospital. Roach crashes while fleeing and lands in a coffin. He is presumed dead.\n\nThe bike then goes for Noddy but gets its front wheel stuck in a bridge, giving Noddy the chance to throw it in a river and spit. Thinking he is safe, Noddy has a victory smoke, but the audience sees a red-light under the water. Noddy then sees it and screams and runs around like a lunatic. He hides in a gym, but the bike doesn't take long to find him and start attacking the patrons with its spikes. Noddy then bashes the bike, which feigns death, making everyone feel safe, until it starts throwing people's limbs in the air. The inspector scares it with his smell. The bike manages to trap Noddy against a wall, but is stopped when Noddy turns on a sun bed. Everyone uses their crucifix and/or garlic breath to force it into the light and it melts. Kim asks how much Noddy really spent on the bike and the priest says they are usually reliable. Back in Noddy's workshop, he accidentally cuts his hand and the blood drips onto the bike's old fuel tank which springs open, leaving the audience begging for a sequel.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Neil Morrissey]] - Noddy\n*[[Amanda Noar]] - Kim\n*[[Michael Elphick]] - Inspector Cleaver\n*[[Anthony Daniels]] - Priest\n*[[Andrew Powell (actor)|Andrew Powell]] - Roach\n*[[George Rossi]] - Chopper\n*[[Daniel Peacock]] - Buzzer\n*[[Midge Taylor]] - First Road Toad\n*[[David Daker]] - Desk Sergeant\n*[[Burt Kwouk]] - Fu King Owner\n*[[Brendan Donnison]] - Satanist High Priest\n*[[Graham Padden]] - Dorm\n*[[Paula Ann Bland]] - Hospital Nurse\n*[[Terence Budd]] - Bikes\n*[[Ann Casson]] - Mrs. Bancroft\n*[[Douglas Campbell (actor)|Douglas Campbell]] - Mr. Bancroft\n*[[Ed Devereaux]] - Pub Landlord\n*[[Colin Campbell (actor)|Colin Campbell]] - Moped\n*[[John Wolskel]] - Clyde\n*[[Solly Assa]] - Victor\n*[[Esta Charkham]] - Mrs. P.C.

Set in a [[Birmingham|Birmingham, England]] suburb, the film is about a man named Noddy and his girlfriend Kim who operate a [[motorcycle courier]] business. One day Noddy buys a classic [[motorbike]], an 850cc [[Norton Commando]], and restores it. That motorbike, however, is possessed by the evil spirit of a man who was being summoned by an occultist who was killed by a [[motorbike gang]]. Whenever the spirit is overcome by a seeming blood lust, the bike starts up, rides on its own and kills people, particularly members of the [[Hells Angels]]. [[Michael Elphick]] plays Inspector Cleaver and [[Anthony Daniels]] plays the eccentric priest who attempts to exorcise the bike's evil spirit.<ref name=\"mfb\" />\n\n==Plot==\nA [[motorbike gang]] kills an occultist with a crossbow during a satanic ritual. An evil spirit inhabits a damaged bike. Noddy is then seen purchasing that very motorcycle for the price of \u00a31100 from a dealer, but he tells Kim he only paid \u00a3600. He proceeds to take it home and fix, with his friend, Buzzer, and girlfriend, Kim, the damage caused by the crossbow by replacing the fuel tank. Buzzer steals the petrol cap for \"funsies\" but then the bike kills him by decapitation.\n\nIt is revealed to the audience that the vehicle has become a bloodthirsty monster. Noddy goes to the scene of the crime where he meets an inspector who smells like garlic. Later, Noddy has a bad dream that the inspector gives him Buzzer's head in a bag and it talks at him but then he wakes up. Then he goes back to sleep and dreams Buzzer is a poo that jumps in his mouth and starts asking how he is. Noddy wakes up again and is chewing his duvet. Noddy and Kim go to the pub and order a large vodka tonic and a pint of cider. Then ten of the bikers from the beginning come in and shoot the bar with the crossbow. One then offers to show Kim his \"chopper\" while she is playing pool. She declines, claiming not to have brought her magnifying glass. He then proceeds to unsheathe an axe and attack the pool table and moving onto plates, starting a bar wide brawl of 10 bikers against our protagonists. Kim manages to slip out the front and drive the bike round the back of the pub where Noddy jumps on it from the first floor and then gets shot with a crossbow bolt.\n\nThey then have Chinese. When Kim orders garlic prawns, the bike goes mad and drives off with her. It takes her under a bridge, throws her off and makes advances on her, until it notices the crucifix around her neck.
