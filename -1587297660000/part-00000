It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]].

The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\".

It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]]. Following their re-branding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.\n\n== Catalog content ==\n\n=== Android applications ===\n{{Further|Android (operating

The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\".

The river flowed eastward from Dorset, following the course of the modern Solent strait, before travelling south and southwest towards the major Channel River system. \n\nThe earliest evidence of archaic human presence on what is now the Isle of Wight is found at [[Priory Bay]]. Here more than 300 [[Acheulean|acheulean handaxes]] have been recovered from the beach and cliff slopes, originating from a sequence of Pleistocene gravels dating approximately to [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|MIS 11]] (424,000-374,000 years ago).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wenban-Smith|first=Francis|title=The Pleistocene sequence at Priory Bay, Isle of Wight (SZ 635 900)|url=https://www.academia.edu/1794967/The_Pleistocene_sequence_at_Priory_Bay_Isle_of_Wight_SZ_635_900_|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA Mousterian flint assemblage, consisting of 50 handaxes and debitage has been recovered from Great Pan Farm near Newport. Possibly dating to MIS 7 (c.240,000 years ago), these tools are associated with Neanderthal occupation. \n\n=== Mesolithic Isle of Wight ===\nA submerged escarpment 11m below sea level off [[Bouldnor Cliff]] on the island's northwest coastline is home to an internationally significant mesolithic archaeological site. The site has yielded evidence of seasonal occupation by mesolithic hunter-gatherers dating to c.8000 years BP.  Finds include flint tools, burnt flint, worked timbers, wooden platforms and pits. The worked wood shows evidence of the splitting of large planks from oak trunks, interpreted as being intended for use as dug-out canoes. DNA analysis of sediments at the site yielded wheat DNA, not found in Britain until the [[Neolithic]] 2000 years after the occupation at Bouldnor Cliff. It has been suggested this is evidence of wide-reaching trade in mesolithic Europe, however the contemporaneity of the wheat with the Mesolithic occupation has been contested. When hunter-gatherers used the site it was located on a river bank surrounded by wetland and woodland.<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/8000-year-old-boat-building-platform-found-coast-britain-180972989/</ref> As sea levels rose throughout the [[Holocene]] the river valley slowly flooded, submerging the site.\n\nEvidence of mesolithic occupation on the island is generally found along the river valleys, particularly along the north of the Island, and in the former catchment of the western Yar. Further key sites are found at Newtown Creek, Werrar and Wootton-Quarr. \n\n=== Neolithic Isle of Wight ===\nNeolithic occupation on the Isle of Wight is primarily attested to by flint tools and monuments. Unlike the previous mesolithic hunter-gatherer population Neolithic communities on the Isle of Wight were based on farming and linked to a wide-scale migration of Neolithic populations from France and northwest Europe to Britain c.6000 years ago. \n\nThe Isle of Wight's most visible Neolithic site is the Longstone at [[Mottistone]], the remains of a [[Long barrow|long-barrow]] originally constructed with two standing stones at the entrance. Only one stone remains standing today. A Neolithic mortuary enclosure has been identified on [[Tennyson Down]] near [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]]. \n\n===Bronze and Iron Age Isle of Wight===\n[[Bronze Age Britain]] had large reserves of tin in the areas of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] and [[tin]] is necessary to [[smelting|smelt]] [[bronze]]. At that time the sea level was much lower and carts of tin were brought across the [[Solent]] at low tide<ref name=\"Adams 1877\">{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=William Henry Davenport|title=Nelsons' hand-book to the Isle of Wight|date=1877|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hQoHAAAAQAAJ&dq=Cotentin+Peninsula+trade+Isle+of+Wight|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Hawkes 1984\"/> for export, possibly on the [[Ferriby Boats]].

From the Anglo-Saxon period Latin ''Vecta'', Old English ''Wiht'' and Old Welsh forms ''Gueid'' and ''Guith'' are recorded. In [[Domesday Book]] it is ''Wit''; the modern Welsh name is ''Ynys Wyth'' (''ynys'' = island). These are all variant forms of the same name, possibly Celtic in origin. It may mean \"place of the division\", because the island divides the two arms of the Solent.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'', 4th ed. (Oxford University Press, 1960) p. 518</ref><ref>[[A. L. F.

Slightly more than half, mainly in the west, is designated as the [[Isle of Wight AONB|Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].  The island has {{convert|258|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of farmland, {{convert|52|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of developed areas, and {{convert|57|mi}} of coastline. Its landscapes are diverse, leading to its oft-quoted description as \"England in miniature\".  In June 2019 the whole island was designated a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]], recognising the sustainable relationships between its residents and the local environment.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-48692295|date=19 June 2019|accessdate=20 June 2019|website=www.bbc.co.uk|title=Isle of Wight joins Unesco's network of biosphere sites}}</ref>\n\nWest Wight is predominantly rural, with dramatic coastlines dominated by the [[chalk]] [[downland]] ridge, running across the whole island and ending in [[the Needles]] stacks.  The southwestern quarter is commonly referred to as the [[Back of the Wight]], and has a unique character. The highest point on the island is [[St Boniface Down]] in the south east, which at {{convert|241|m|ft|order=flip}} is a [[Marilyn (hill)|marilyn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=9547|title=St Boniface Down, England |author=Staff writer(s); no by-line| date=1987\u20132012| publisher=Peakbagger.com |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> The most notable habitats on the rest of the island are probably the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are scenic features, important for wildlife, and internationally protected.\n\nThe island has three principal rivers. The [[River Medina]] flows north into the [[Solent]], the [[Eastern Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Eastern Yar]] flows roughly northeast to [[Bembridge]] Harbour, and the [[Western Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Western Yar]] flows the short distance from [[Freshwater Bay, Isle of Wight|Freshwater Bay]] to a relatively large estuary at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]].  Without human intervention the sea might well have split the island into three: at the west end where a bank of pebbles separates Freshwater Bay from the [[marsh]]y backwaters of the Western Yar east of Freshwater, and at the east end where a thin strip of land separates [[Sandown Bay]] from the marshy Eastern Yar basin.\n\nThe [[Undercliff]] between St Catherine's Point and [[Bonchurch]] is the largest area of landslip morphology in western Europe.\n\nThe north coast is unusual in having four high tides each day, with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours.  This arises because the western Solent is narrower than the eastern; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around the south of the island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water.<ref name=\"Miscellany\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n{{main|Geology of the Isle of Wight}}\n\nThe Isle of Wight is made up of a variety of rock types dating from early [[Cretaceous]] (around 127&nbsp;million years ago) to the middle of the [[Palaeogene]] (around 30&nbsp;million years ago). The geological structure is dominated by a large [[monocline]] which causes a marked change in age of strata from the northern younger [[Tertiary]] beds to the older Cretaceous beds of the south. This gives rise to a [[Strike and dip|dip]] of almost 90 degrees in the chalk beds, seen best at [[the Needles]].\n\nThe northern half of the island is mainly composed of [[clay]]s, with the southern half formed of the [[chalk]] of the central east\u2013west downs, as well as Upper and Lower [[Greensand]]s and [[Wealden]] strata.<ref name=\"Hopson\">{{cite journal | url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/15996/1/Hopson_IoW_Geo_History_PGEOLA-D-11-00048R1.pdf | title=The geological history of the Isle of Wight: an overview of the 'diamond in Britain's geological crown' | author=Hopson P. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=745\u2013763 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.09.007}}</ref> These strata continue west from the island across the [[Solent]] into [[Dorset]], forming the basin of [[Poole Harbour]] (Tertiary) and the [[Isle of Purbeck]] (Cretaceous) respectively. The chalky ridges of Wight and Purbeck were a single formation before they were breached by waters from the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] during the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], forming the Solent and turning Wight into an island. [[The Needles]], along with [[Old Harry Rocks]] on Purbeck, represent the edges of this breach.\n\nAll the rocks found on the island are [[sedimentary]], such as [[limestone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and [[sandstone]]s. They are rich in fossils; many can be seen exposed on beaches as the cliffs erode. [[Lignite|Lignitic coal]] is present in small quantities within seams, and can be seen on the cliffs and shore at [[Whitecliff Bay]]. Fossilised [[mollusc]]s have been found there, and also on the northern coast along with [[fossil]]ised [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[mammal]] bones; the youngest date back to around 30&nbsp;million years ago.\n\nThe island is one of the most important areas in Europe for [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s. The [[Erosion|eroding]] cliffs often reveal previously hidden remains, particularly along the [[Back of the Wight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/isle-of-wight-activities/fossil-and-dinosaur-hunting/ |title=Fossil and Dinosaur Hunting|publisher=redfunnel.co.uk |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> [[Dinosaur]] bones and [[ichnite|fossilised footprints]] can be seen in and on the rocks exposed around the island's beaches, especially at [[Yaverland]] and [[Compton Bay]]. As a result, the island has been nicknamed \"Dinosaur Island\" and [[Dinosaur Isle]] was established in 2001.\n\nThe area was affected by sea level changes during the repeated [[Quaternary]] glaciations. The island probably became separated from the mainland about 125,000 years ago, during the [[Eemian|Ipswichian]] [[interglacial]].<ref name=\"Booth&Brayson\">{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/79/386230.pdf | title=Geology, landscape and human interactions: examples from the Isle of Wight | author=Booth K.A. & Brayson J. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=938\u2013948 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.01.004}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Isle of Wight OS OpenData map.png|[[Ordnance Survey]] map of the island\nFile:IOW geology.svg|Geological map of the island\nFile:Blackgang Chine c1910 - Project Gutenberg eText 17296.jpg|[[Blackgang Chine]], circa 1910\nFile:Isle of Wight coastline.jpg|A view of [[the Needles]] and [[Alum Bay]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Climate==\nLike the rest of the UK, the island has an [[oceanic climate]], but is somewhat milder and sunnier, which makes it a holiday destination.

The island has a warmer climate and a longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom. [[Garlic]] has been successfully grown in [[Newchurch, Isle of Wight|Newchurch]] for many years, and is even exported to France.

The river flowed eastward from Dorset, following the course of the modern Solent strait, before travelling south and southwest towards the major Channel River system. \n\nThe earliest evidence of archaic human presence on what is now the Isle of Wight is found at [[Priory Bay]]. Here more than 300 [[Acheulean|acheulean handaxes]] have been recovered from the beach and cliff slopes, originating from a sequence of Pleistocene gravels dating approximately to [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|MIS 11]] (424,000-374,000 years ago).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wenban-Smith|first=Francis|title=The Pleistocene sequence at Priory Bay, Isle of Wight (SZ 635 900)|url=https://www.academia.edu/1794967/The_Pleistocene_sequence_at_Priory_Bay_Isle_of_Wight_SZ_635_900_|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA Mousterian flint assemblage, consisting of 50 handaxes and debitage has been recovered from Great Pan Farm near Newport. Possibly dating to MIS 7 (c.240,000 years ago), these tools are associated with Neanderthal occupation. \n\n=== Mesolithic Isle of Wight ===\nA submerged escarpment 11m below sea level off [[Bouldnor Cliff]] on the island's northwest coastline is home to an internationally significant mesolithic archaeological site. The site has yielded evidence of seasonal occupation by mesolithic hunter-gatherers dating to c.8000 years BP.  Finds include flint tools, burnt flint, worked timbers, wooden platforms and pits. The worked wood shows evidence of the splitting of large planks from oak trunks, interpreted as being intended for use as dug-out canoes. DNA analysis of sediments at the site yielded wheat DNA, not found in Britain until the [[Neolithic]] 2000 years after the occupation at Bouldnor Cliff. It has been suggested this is evidence of wide-reaching trade in mesolithic Europe, however the contemporaneity of the wheat with the Mesolithic occupation has been contested. When hunter-gatherers used the site it was located on a river bank surrounded by wetland and woodland.<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/8000-year-old-boat-building-platform-found-coast-britain-180972989/</ref> As sea levels rose throughout the [[Holocene]] the river valley slowly flooded, submerging the site.\n\nEvidence of mesolithic occupation on the island is generally found along the river valleys, particularly along the north of the Island, and in the former catchment of the western Yar. Further key sites are found at Newtown Creek, Werrar and Wootton-Quarr. \n\n=== Neolithic Isle of Wight ===\nNeolithic occupation on the Isle of Wight is primarily attested to by flint tools and monuments. Unlike the previous mesolithic hunter-gatherer population Neolithic communities on the Isle of Wight were based on farming and linked to a wide-scale migration of Neolithic populations from France and northwest Europe to Britain c.6000 years ago. \n\nThe Isle of Wight's most visible Neolithic site is the Longstone at [[Mottistone]], the remains of a [[Long barrow|long-barrow]] originally constructed with two standing stones at the entrance. Only one stone remains standing today. A Neolithic mortuary enclosure has been identified on [[Tennyson Down]] near [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]]. \n\n===Bronze and Iron Age Isle of Wight===\n[[Bronze Age Britain]] had large reserves of tin in the areas of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] and [[tin]] is necessary to [[smelting|smelt]] [[bronze]].

The southwestern quarter is commonly referred to as the [[Back of the Wight]], and has a unique character. The highest point on the island is [[St Boniface Down]] in the south east, which at {{convert|241|m|ft|order=flip}} is a [[Marilyn (hill)|marilyn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=9547|title=St Boniface Down, England |author=Staff writer(s); no by-line| date=1987\u20132012| publisher=Peakbagger.com |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> The most notable habitats on the rest of the island are probably the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are scenic features, important for wildlife, and internationally protected.\n\nThe island has three principal rivers. The [[River Medina]] flows north into the [[Solent]], the [[Eastern Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Eastern Yar]] flows roughly northeast to [[Bembridge]] Harbour, and the [[Western Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Western Yar]] flows the short distance from [[Freshwater Bay, Isle of Wight|Freshwater Bay]] to a relatively large estuary at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]].  Without human intervention the sea might well have split the island into three: at the west end where a bank of pebbles separates Freshwater Bay from the [[marsh]]y backwaters of the Western Yar east of Freshwater, and at the east end where a thin strip of land separates [[Sandown Bay]] from the marshy Eastern Yar basin.\n\nThe [[Undercliff]] between St Catherine's Point and [[Bonchurch]] is the largest area of landslip morphology in western Europe.\n\nThe north coast is unusual in having four high tides each day, with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours.  This arises because the western Solent is narrower than the eastern; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around the south of the island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water.<ref name=\"Miscellany\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n{{main|Geology of the Isle of Wight}}\n\nThe Isle of Wight is made up of a variety of rock types dating from early [[Cretaceous]] (around 127&nbsp;million years ago) to the middle of the [[Palaeogene]] (around 30&nbsp;million years ago). The geological structure is dominated by a large [[monocline]] which causes a marked change in age of strata from the northern younger [[Tertiary]] beds to the older Cretaceous beds of the south. This gives rise to a [[Strike and dip|dip]] of almost 90 degrees in the chalk beds, seen best at [[the Needles]].\n\nThe northern half of the island is mainly composed of [[clay]]s, with the southern half formed of the [[chalk]] of the central east\u2013west downs, as well as Upper and Lower [[Greensand]]s and [[Wealden]] strata.<ref name=\"Hopson\">{{cite journal | url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/15996/1/Hopson_IoW_Geo_History_PGEOLA-D-11-00048R1.pdf | title=The geological history of the Isle of Wight: an overview of the 'diamond in Britain's geological crown' | author=Hopson P. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=745\u2013763 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.09.007}}</ref> These strata continue west from the island across the [[Solent]] into [[Dorset]], forming the basin of [[Poole Harbour]] (Tertiary) and the [[Isle of Purbeck]] (Cretaceous) respectively. The chalky ridges of Wight and Purbeck were a single formation before they were breached by waters from the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] during the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], forming the Solent and turning Wight into an island. [[The Needles]], along with [[Old Harry Rocks]] on Purbeck, represent the edges of this breach.\n\nAll the rocks found on the island are [[sedimentary]], such as [[limestone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and [[sandstone]]s. They are rich in fossils; many can be seen exposed on beaches as the cliffs erode. [[Lignite|Lignitic coal]] is present in small quantities within seams, and can be seen on the cliffs and shore at [[Whitecliff Bay]]. Fossilised [[mollusc]]s have been found there, and also on the northern coast along with [[fossil]]ised [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[mammal]] bones; the youngest date back to around 30&nbsp;million years ago.\n\nThe island is one of the most important areas in Europe for [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s. The [[Erosion|eroding]] cliffs often reveal previously hidden remains, particularly along the [[Back of the Wight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/isle-of-wight-activities/fossil-and-dinosaur-hunting/ |title=Fossil and Dinosaur Hunting|publisher=redfunnel.co.uk |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> [[Dinosaur]] bones and [[ichnite|fossilised footprints]] can be seen in and on the rocks exposed around the island's beaches, especially at [[Yaverland]] and [[Compton Bay]]. As a result, the island has been nicknamed \"Dinosaur Island\" and [[Dinosaur Isle]] was established in 2001.\n\nThe area was affected by sea level changes during the repeated [[Quaternary]] glaciations. The island probably became separated from the mainland about 125,000 years ago, during the [[Eemian|Ipswichian]] [[interglacial]].<ref name=\"Booth&Brayson\">{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/79/386230.pdf | title=Geology, landscape and human interactions: examples from the Isle of Wight | author=Booth K.A. & Brayson J. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=938\u2013948 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.01.004}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Isle of Wight OS OpenData map.png|[[Ordnance Survey]] map of the island\nFile:IOW geology.svg|Geological map of the island\nFile:Blackgang Chine c1910 - Project Gutenberg eText 17296.jpg|[[Blackgang Chine]], circa 1910\nFile:Isle of Wight coastline.jpg|A view of [[the Needles]] and [[Alum Bay]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Climate==\nLike the rest of the UK, the island has an [[oceanic climate]], but is somewhat milder and sunnier, which makes it a holiday destination.

The island has a warmer climate and a longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom. [[Garlic]] has been successfully grown in [[Newchurch, Isle of Wight|Newchurch]] for many years, and is even exported to France.

The screenplay by [[Jack Rose (screenwriter)|Jack Rose]] and [[Melville Shavelson]] was based on the musical ''[[Hazel Flagg]]'' (1953) by [[Ben Hecht]], which was in turn based on the story \"Letter to the Editor\" by [[James H.

His big dream in life is to visit [[New York City]] while he is young.\n\nOne day he finds an abandoned automobile at an old atomic proving ground. His doctor and best friend, Steve Harris, diagnoses him with radiation poisoning and gives Homer three weeks to live.\n\nWally Cook, a reporter for a New York newspaper, hears of Homer's plight and convinces Oliver Stone, her editor, to provide an all-expenses paid trip to fulfill Homer's lifelong fantasy of seeing New York.\n\nSteve, however, realizes that he made an error and Homer is only suffering from a sinus condition. Steve agrees to keep this new diagnosis a secret after Homer begs him ... particularly after meeting the attractive reporter. Steve announces that only he can provide medical treatment to Homer and must accompany him on the trip.\n\nNew York embraces Homer and he becomes a celebrity, with everyone following his every move in the paper. Homer even makes plans to marry Wally, despite the fact that she has fallen for Steve. \n\nMeanwhile, editor Stone is anxious for Homer to die. Every day it costs the newspaper money to support the dying man's extravagant requests, which includes ordering 3,000 shrimp cocktails for his hotel suite. Stone hires three specialists to examine Homer, who is given a clean bill of health.\n\nTo escape the fix that they have gotten themselves into, Homer fakes suicide. The newspaper gets the exclusive story. Wally marries Steve, and the two guys get new jobs in New York as street sweepers.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!

The screenplay by [[Jack Rose (screenwriter)|Jack Rose]] and [[Melville Shavelson]] was based on the musical ''[[Hazel Flagg]]'' (1953) by [[Ben Hecht]], which was in turn based on the story \"Letter to the Editor\" by [[James H. Street]].\n\nAn earlier film based on Street's story, ''[[Nothing Sacred (film)|Nothing Sacred]]'' (1937), had been by [[Selznick International Pictures]] (released through [[United Artists]]) with [[Carole Lombard]] and [[Fredric March]], and directed by [[William A. Wellman]]. The 1954 version features original music by [[Walter Scharf]], cinematography by [[Daniel L. Fapp]], art direction by [[Albert Nozaki]] and [[Hal Pereira]], and costume design by [[Edith Head]].\n\nIn addition to Martin and Lewis, the cast of ''Living It Up'' includes [[Janet Leigh]], [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], [[Fred Clark]], [[Sheree North]], and [[Sig Ruman]].\n\n==Plot==\nHomer Flagg is a railroad worker in the small town of Desert Hole, [[New Mexico]]. His big dream in life is to visit [[New York City]] while he is young.\n\nOne day he finds an abandoned automobile at an old atomic proving ground. His doctor and best friend, Steve Harris, diagnoses him with radiation poisoning and gives Homer three weeks to live.\n\nWally Cook, a reporter for a New York newspaper, hears of Homer's plight and convinces Oliver Stone, her editor, to provide an all-expenses paid trip to fulfill Homer's lifelong fantasy of seeing New York.\n\nSteve, however, realizes that he made an error and Homer is only suffering from a sinus condition. Steve agrees to keep this new diagnosis a secret after Homer begs him ... particularly after meeting the attractive reporter. Steve announces that only he can provide medical treatment to Homer and must accompany him on the trip.\n\nNew York embraces Homer and he becomes a celebrity, with everyone following his every move in the paper. Homer even makes plans to marry Wally, despite the fact that she has fallen for Steve. \n\nMeanwhile, editor Stone is anxious for Homer to die. Every day it is costing the newspaper money to support the dying man's extravagant requests, which includes ordering 3,000 shrimp cocktails for his hotel suite. Stone hires three specialists to examine Homer, who is given a clean bill of health.\n\nTo escape the fix that they have gotten themselves into, Homer fakes suicide. The newspaper gets the exclusive story. Wally gets married to Steve, and the two guys get new jobs in New York as street sweepers.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n!
