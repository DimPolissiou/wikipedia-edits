The Al-Shabaab militant group is majorly concentrated in Somalia and because of weak border security, often spills over into Kenya. Kenya has a minority [[Muslims|Muslim]] population that has historically been alienated, and with a growing dissent for Western activities with Kenyan borders, it has enabled a growing number of [[Jihadism|jihadist]] Muslims in Nairobi. The Muslim community in Kenya has lost political and economic representation leading up to the attacks, which lead them to focus their loyalty on Islam and the Middle East, not the nation. This enabled the jihadist movement to acquire a strong grip within Kenya, as Kenyan nationals assisted in the attacks on the Paradise Hotel and on the Boeing 757.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Africa in world politics: reforming political order|last=Harbeson|first=John W|last2=Rothchild|first2=Donald S|date=2009|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4364-8|location=Boulder, CO|language=English|oclc=192042020}}</ref>\n\n==International response==\nImmediately following the attacks, Israel began evacuating all Israeli citizens within Kenyan borders.

It was a joint effort between Kenya, the U.S., and Israel to apprehend the attackers. They were able to determine that al-Qaeda operatives were behind the attacks due to the similarities between the incidents in Nairobi and Mombassa. The attackers had used [[car bomb]]<nowiki/>s sourced from local materials. To plan and coordinate the attacks, al-Qaeda operatives rented houses in affluent neighborhoods to meet up with the non-Kenyan suicide bombers. <ref>Carson, Johnnie. \"Kenya: The Struggle against Terrorism.\" ''Battling Terrorism in the Horn of Africa'', edited by Robert I.

The Al-Shabaab militant group is majorly concentrated in Somalia and because of weak border security, often spills over into Kenya. Kenya has a minority [[Muslims|Muslim]] population that has historically been alienated, and with a growing dissent for Western activities with Kenyan borders, it has enabled a growing number of [[Jihadism|jihadist]] Muslims in Nairobi. The Muslim community in Kenya has lost political and economic representation leading up to the attacks, which lead them to focus their loyalty on Islam and the Middle East, not the nation.

They were able to determine that al-Qaeda operatives were behind the attacks due to the similarities between the incidents in Nairobi and Mombassa. The attackers had used [[car bomb]]<nowiki/>s sourced from local materials. To plan and coordinate the attacks, al-Qaeda operatives rented houses in affluent neighborhoods to meet up with the non-Kenyan suicide bombers. <ref>Carson, Johnnie. \u201cKenya: The Struggle against Terrorism.\u201d ''Battling Terrorism in the Horn of Africa'', edited by Robert I.

It's reported that 75,000 women were abducted and raped during the partition, sooner after Pakistan's Independence Fatima Jinnah took part in refugee relief work and formed the Women's Relief Committee during the transfer of power, which evolved into the All Pakistan Women s Association. Later on, Fatima Jinnah set up a secret radio station to running for president when it was perceived to be a man's role. These are some of the empowering stories that are often left untold and very few people talk about this effort of empowering women in Pakistan.\n\n[[Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan|Begum Ra'na Liaquat Ali Khan]] helped the refugees who fled India during partition and also organized the [[All Pakistan Women's Association]] in 1949,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Feminism, sexuality and the rhetoric of Westernization in Pakistan: precarious citizenship ByMoon Charania|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781317907077/chapters/10.4324/9781315848501-34|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|doi=10.4324/9781315848501-34|access-date=2019-04-04|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> two years after the creation of her country. Noticing that there were not many nurses in Karachi, Khan requested the army to train women to give injections and first aid. This resulted in the para-military forces for women. Nursing also became a career path for many girls. She continued her mission, even after her husband was assassinated in 1951, and became the first Muslim woman delegate to the United Nations in 1952.\n\n=== Second phase 1980s ===\nThe end of 1970s  started a new wave of [[Islamization|political Islamization]] in many Muslim majority countries. In Pakistan a military dictatorial regime of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] came into power & introduced several laws for more [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization of Pakistan]]  called  '''[[Hudood]] Ordinances'''  It replaced parts of the British-era [[Pakistan Penal Code]], adding new criminal offences of [[adultery]] and [[fornication]], and new punishments of [[Flagellation#Islam|whipping]], [[Amputation#Legal punishment|amputation]], and [[Rajm|stoning to death]]. Feminist movement in Pakistan highly opposed this forced implementation of Islam which was based on an archaic understanding of Islamic literature and asked for more liberal and modernist interpetations. After much controversy and criticism only parts of the law were considerably revised in 2006 by the [[Women's Protection Bill]].\n\non backdrop of this General Zia's more [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization of Pakistan]]  called  [[Hudood]] Ordinances,  A more vocal Women's Action Forum (WAF) got formed in 1981<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zia|first=Afiya Shehrbano|date=February 2009|title=the reinvention of feminism in Pakistan|journal=Feminist Review|volume=91|issue=1|pages=29\u201346|doi=10.1057/fr.2008.48|issn=0141-7789}}</ref>  According to Madihah Akhter General Zia ultimately sought to  [[Islamic religious police|moral police women role in public sphere]] with his Islamization plans, which brought unexpected pressure on Pakistani women taking them back suddenly in medieval times. As a reaction to [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] rigid form of Zia's  Islamization, many Pakistani women from diverse fields like writers, academics, performers became active to oppose women-denigrating policies of General Zia. Madihah Akhter further says younger generation of 1980's women activist were more ''feminist in their'' outlook and approach on one hand; Women's Action Forum used \"progressive interpretations of Islam\" to counter the state's [[Patriarchy|patriarchal version of religion]] and morality, and in doing so, succeeded in getting unexpected support of right wing Islamic women's organizations, too. The WAF and its associates mass demonstrated  against a number of laws and issues throughout the early 1980s. They campaigned  through various outreach approaches like newspaper articles,  art, poetry, and songs in schools and universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thefeministwire.com/2012/10/feminists-in-pakistan/|title=Feminists\u2026in Pakistan?|date=2012-10-15|website=The Feminist Wire|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\nFeminist work in Pakistan cuts across all sectors of civil society: education, health, poverty, domestic violence, rape, denial of rights and legal/ political reform through range of  women's movements<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1988\u20131999 ===\n\nPost General Zia period,  while Pakistan got its first woman prime minister in the form of Benazir Bhutto, that helped create some positive image for Pakistan, and she made some small efforts like all women police station and appointing women judges for the first time; she could not succeed in repealing anti-women laws of General Zia era.\n\nPost-Zia era (1988\u20131999), activists produced research that focused on increasing women's political voice and strengthening inclusive democratic governance (Shaheed et al., 2009; Zia, 2005; Bari, 2015).

The movement gained momentum as women were now increasingly able to share their ideas and beliefs. [[Aurat March]] (Women March) are now held in numerous cities over the country. The subjects and issues raised by the marches are of homosexual rights, transgender rights, non-binary rights, rape, women education, workplace harassment and more. The contemporary movement has been more vocal against religious extremism and conservative religious values. This vocal criticism of religious institutions and patriarchal construct of religion has generated criticism and counter-movements too, examples of which we see in Haya March and Nisaism. Currently two types of Feminisms exist in the country.\n\n==== Liberal Feminism ====\nThis type of Feminism has been the more prevalent one in leftist liberal circles and is often supported by left-leaning political parties such as [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]. It is often characterized by liberal values of freedom, liberty, human rights and secularism and has been one of the most vocal supporters of LBTGQ+ rights and marriage in Pakistan. \n\n==== Nisaism ====\nNisaism is a type of feminism in Pakistan which is more traditionalist in nature and supports the acquisition of women rights under Islamic lens. This movement is mainly supported by centrists and right-wing parties of Pakistan. The word Nisaism comes from Surah Nisa, a chapter of Qur'an, which shows the Islamic roots of the movement. The movement has come under criticism though for preaching Islamic rights and accepting Islamic patriarchal structure of Pakistan.\n\n== Feminism through Art and Literature ==\n\nFeminist authors usually describe journey of feminism in Pakistan as oscillating or two steps forwards and a step backwards because Pakistani women's movements have been struggling against continued pressure backlash of patriarchal hegemony.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1531866|title=The contrite gender formula of Meray Paas Tum Ho and the portrayal of women in cultural scripts|last=Zia|first=Afiya S.|date=2020-02-03|website=DAWN.COM|language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> In art and literature it struggles against orthodox advice literature imposing religious dogma through puritanical reform.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Shahbaz Ahmad Cheema, Pakistani patriarchy undertakes entire exercise of their  literature and art with ultimate goal of making women thoroughly accept internalize and promote coercion [of the male discourse] itself as an ideal.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Afiya S Zia, Kind of writings of [[Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]]; in Ashraf Ali Thanawi's magnum opus, ''[[Bahishti Zewar]]''  and; in post partition times, [[Abul A'la Maududi|Abu Ala Maududi]]\u2019s writings are larger male reformist projects intending to create and sustain Muslim privileged class facilitating and supporting patriarchal male dominance.

The book railed against social inequity, hypocritical [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|maulvis]] and the exploitation of women in a deeply [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]]. Of the two pieces that Jahan contributed to Angaaray, one was a short story barely three pages long ''Dilli ki Sair'' is a little narrative about a burqa-clad woman watching life on a railway platform waiting for her husband to turn up and take her home. The story is a brief but penetrating meditation on life behind the 'veil' and the blindness of [[male privilege]] towards the experience of women behind the purdah. The other piece, '''Parde Ke Peeche''', is a conversation between two women from affluent, sharif (respectable) families. Since then Muslim orthodox clergy in then united India opposed publishers had to withdraw the book and then British government too preferred to ban for its own political convenience.\n\n[[Ismat Chughtai]] Beginning in the 1930s, she wrote extensively on themes including [[female sexuality]] and [[femininity]], middle-class gentility, and [[class conflict]], often from a Marxist perspective.\n\nAccording to S.S.Sirajuddin in Encyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literature in English expresses reservations about the availability of free space for feminism in Pakistan & feels that nation space is much affected by religious fervor.

The fiction writers of Pakistan have tried a lot to portray an ideal picture of women enjoying equal rights with men.

Nursing also became a career path for many girls. She continued her mission, even after her husband was assassinated in 1951, and became the first Muslim woman delegate to the United Nations in 1952.\n\n=== Second phase 1980s ===\nThe end of 1970s  started a new wave of [[Islamization|political Islamization]] in many Muslim majority countries. In Pakistan a military dictatorial regime of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] came into power & introduced several laws for more [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization of Pakistan]]  called  '''[[Hudood]] Ordinances'''  It replaced parts of the British-era [[Pakistan Penal Code]], adding new criminal offences of [[adultery]] and [[fornication]], and new punishments of [[Flagellation#Islam|whipping]], [[Amputation#Legal punishment|amputation]], and [[Rajm|stoning to death]]. Feminist movement in Pakistan highly opposed this forced implementation of Islam which was based on an archaic understanding of Islamic literature and asked for more liberal and modernist interpetations. After much controversy and criticism only parts of the law were considerably revised in 2006 by the [[Women's Protection Bill]].\n\non backdrop of this General Zia's more [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization of Pakistan]]  called  [[Hudood]] Ordinances,  A more vocal Women's Action Forum (WAF) got formed in 1981<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zia|first=Afiya Shehrbano|date=February 2009|title=the reinvention of feminism in Pakistan|journal=Feminist Review|volume=91|issue=1|pages=29\u201346|doi=10.1057/fr.2008.48|issn=0141-7789}}</ref>  According to Madihah Akhter General Zia ultimately sought to  [[Islamic religious police|moral police women role in public sphere]] with his Islamization plans, which brought unexpected pressure on Pakistani women taking them back suddenly in medieval times. As a reaction to [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] rigid form of Zia's  Islamization, many Pakistani women from diverse fields like writers, academics, performers became active to oppose women-denigrating policies of General Zia. Madihah Akhter further says younger generation of 1980's women activist were more ''feminist in their'' outlook and approach on one hand; Women's Action Forum used \"progressive interpretations of Islam\" to counter the state's [[Patriarchy|patriarchal version of religion]] and morality, and in doing so, succeeded in getting unexpected support of right wing Islamic women's organizations, too. The WAF and its associates mass demonstrated  against a number of laws and issues throughout the early 1980s.

The movement gained momentum as women were now increasingly able to share their ideas and beliefs. [[Aurat March]] (Women March) are now held in numerous cities over the country. The subjects and issues raised by the marches are of homosexual rights, transgender rights, non-binary rights, rape, women education, workplace harassment and more. The contemporary movement has been more vocal against religious extremism and conservative religious values. This vocal criticism of religious institutions and patriarchal construct of religion has generated criticism and counter-movements too, examples of which we see in Haya March and Nisaism. Currently two types of Feminisms exist in the country.\n\n==== Liberal Feminism ====\nThis type of Feminism has been the more prevalent one in leftist liberal circles and is often supported by left-leaning political parties such as [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]. It is often characterized by liberal values of freedom, liberty, human rights and secularism and has been one of the most vocal supporters of LBTGQ+ rights and marriage in Pakistan. \n\n==== Nisaism ====\nNisaism is a type of feminism in Pakistan which is more traditionalist in nature and supports the acquisition of women rights under Islamic lens. This movement is mainly supported by centrists and right-wing parties of Pakistan. The word Nisaism comes from Surah Nisa, a chapter of Qur'an, which shows the Islamic roots of the movement. The movement has come under criticism though for preaching Islamic rights and accepting Islamic patriarchal structure of Pakistan.\n\n== Feminism through Art and Literature ==\n\nFeminist authors usually describe journey of feminism in Pakistan as oscillating or two steps forwards and a step backwards because Pakistani women's movements have been struggling against continued pressure backlash of patriarchal hegemony.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1531866|title=The contrite gender formula of Meray Paas Tum Ho and the portrayal of women in cultural scripts|last=Zia|first=Afiya S.|date=2020-02-03|website=DAWN.COM|language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> In art and literature it struggles against orthodox advice literature imposing religious dogma through puritanical reform.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Shahbaz Ahmad Cheema, Pakistani patriarchy undertakes entire exercise of their  literature and art with ultimate goal of making women thoroughly accept internalize and promote coercion [of the male discourse] itself as an ideal.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Afiya S Zia, Kind of writings of [[Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]]; in Ashraf Ali Thanawi's magnum opus, ''[[Bahishti Zewar]]''  and; in post partition times, [[Abul A'la Maududi|Abu Ala Maududi]]\u2019s writings are larger male reformist projects intending to create and sustain Muslim privileged class facilitating and supporting patriarchal male dominance.

The book railed against social inequity, hypocritical [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|maulvis]] and the exploitation of women in a deeply [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]]. Of the two pieces that Jahan contributed to Angaaray, one was a short story barely three pages long ''Dilli ki Sair'' is a little narrative about a burqa-clad woman watching life on a railway platform waiting for her husband to turn up and take her home. The story is a brief but penetrating meditation on life behind the 'veil' and the blindness of [[male privilege]] towards the experience of women behind the purdah. The other piece, '''Parde Ke Peeche''', is a conversation between two women from affluent, sharif (respectable) families. Since then Muslim orthodox clergy in then united India opposed publishers had to withdraw the book and then British government too preferred to ban for its own political convenience.\n\n[[Ismat Chughtai]] Beginning in the 1930s, she wrote extensively on themes including [[female sexuality]] and [[femininity]], middle-class gentility, and [[class conflict]], often from a Marxist perspective.\n\nAccording to S.S.Sirajuddin in Encyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literature in English expresses reservations about the availability of free space for feminism in Pakistan & feels that nation space is much affected by religious fervor.

Pack and others conceived the idea that the supply of food could be greatly increased without the use of land and manpower already engaged in agriculture, and without the significant use of transportation facilities needed for the war effort.  The campaign promoted the cultivation of available private and public lands, resulting in over five million gardens in the USA<ref>Pack, Charles Lathrop.

In the city of [[Toronto]], women's organizations brought expert gardeners into the schools to get school children and their families interested in gardening.

Food production had fallen dramatically during [[World War I]], especially in Europe, where agricultural labor had been recruited into military service and remaining farms devastated by the conflict.  Pack and others conceived the idea that the supply of food could be greatly increased without the use of land and manpower already engaged in agriculture, and without the significant use of transportation facilities needed for the war effort.  The campaign promoted the cultivation of available private and public lands, resulting in over five million gardens in the USA<ref>Pack, Charles Lathrop.

Sometimes a sports field was left as it was but used for sheep-grazing instead of being mown (for example see {{section link|Lawrence Sheriff School|Effects of the Second World War}}). By 1943, the number of [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] had roughly doubled to 1,400,000, including rural, urban and suburban plots.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=x2GUDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=landscape%20and%20englishness&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Landscape and Englishness: Second Expanded Edition|last=Matless|first=David|date=2016-09-15|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=9781780237145|location=London|pages=246|language=en}}</ref> [[C.

Local communities would have festivals and competitions to showcase the produce each person grew in their own gardens.

He is generally credited with a vital role in the party\u2019s rapid organizational growth in the 1940s. For the last two years of his life he directed the party from [[prison]].\n\n==Early life==\nYusuf Salman Yusuf was born in Baghdad in 1901 to a father from a christian village, [[Bartella]], in the province of [[Mosul]], northern Iraq. His family was humble, and his father is recorded as having made his living selling cakes and sweets. In 1907 he moved with his family to [[Basra]] in the south of the country in search of a better livelihood.\n\nYusuf was an ethnic Assyrian and attended the [[Syriac Christian]] School in Basra from 1908 to 1914, and the American Mission School in the city from 1914 to 1916. His education was then interrupted as his father had fallen ill and he had to seek employment for the family\u2019s upkeep. He first took a job as a translator and clerk with the [[British Army]] in Basra, before moving to [[Nasiriyah]] in 1919 to help his brother run a mill. In 1924 he returned to Basra and gained employment as a clerk at the Electricity Supply Authority. He also goes by Fahad Squad.\n\n==Early communist activity and travel abroad==\nIn 1927, Yusuf met Piotr Vasili, a fellow [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and  an undercover emissary of the [[Comintern]], who introduced him to socialism and communism. He took part in the first communist circle established that year in al-Nasiriyya.\n\nTwo years later, in 1929, Yusuf left his job at the Electricity Supply Authority and applied for a passport to travel abroad. His application was refused due to his lack of funds, but he left the country anyway, traveling through [[Khuzestan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. In the course of this voyage he appears to have attempted to contact the Comintern and to have asked the [[Palestine Communist Party]] for funds to help him engage in political work in Iraq.\n\nIn 1930, the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty]] was signed, leading to widespread anger in Iraq. Yusuf returned home and a year later was active in organizing the July 1931 strikes in response to the introduction of a new municipal tax. He continued his agitational and propaganda activities in al-Nasiriyya until February 1935, when he left Iraq once more, this time headed for Moscow where he was due to enroll at the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East]] (KUTV) for training as a future leader of communist party activity. He traveled through Syria, [[France]] and [[Italy]] before arriving in the Soviet Union, where he remained a student until summer 1937. It appears that before his return to Iraq at the end of January 1938, he may have been entrusted with a Comintern mission in Western Europe; he seems to have spent the winter of 1938 in France and [[Belgium]].\n\n==Return to Iraq==\nOn his return, Yusuf \u2013 for the moment going by the party name of ''Sa'id'' -  met [[Abdullah Mas\u2019ud]], who was organising a communist group in Baghdad. He then travelled around the country for some time, but in December 1940, on hearing that Mas'ud was launching a communist journal, ''al-Shararah'' (''the spark''), he returned to Baghdad and requested that he be in charge of it. This Mas'ud refused, but he suggested that Fahd stay in Baghdad and engage in party work on a stipend, and Fahd accepted the offer.\n\n==Leader of a split party==\nOn 29 October 1941, the police arrested Abdullah Mas'ud and Fahd took over his leadership role. In November he was elected first secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party, and immediately set about imposing his authority on the organization, dismissing most members of the old Central Committee. Fahd's leadership style led to a dispute with a prominent member of the leadership, [[Zhu Nun Ayyub]], who repeatedly demanded that Fahd convene a party congress which would adopt rules for the party. Fahd responded by having Ayyub and his supporters expelled in August 1942.\n\nIn November 1942 Fahd demanded the sacking from the Central Committee of another member, Wadi' Talyah. His opponents on the committee refused to accept this, and accused him of egocentrism and dictatorship. The row had not been resolved when Fahd had to travel abroad. During his absence, Abdullah Mas'ud's supporters called a party congress without informing other members of the Central Committee. The congress, held on 20 November, dismissed all Fahd's supporters \u2013 but not Fahd himself \u2013 from the committee and elected Mas'ud first secretary.\n\nAs the new Central Committee had retained control of ''Al-Sharara'', Fahd's supporters started issuing a new journal, entitled ''al-Qa'ida'' (''the base''), in February 1943. Fahd returned to Baghdad in April 1943, and the difficult process of reuniting the party began. However, he was soon able to concentrate on organisational work.\n\n==Building the base for a mass party, 1943 - 1947==\nIn building up the party, Fahd was guided by his own class feelings and political distrust of the intelligentsia and students, as much as by [[Leninist]] principles.  He concentrated on the workers in the foreign-owned industries, and was assisted primarily by his trusted supporters [[Ali Sakar]], [[Zaki Bassim]] and [[Ahmad 'Abbas]]. While a large proportion of the industrial workforce was employed in small locally owned workshops, the party paid less attention to this sector; in many cases they were working for members of their extended family, and in addition they did not have the strategic importance of the [[Kirkuk]] oilfield workers, the railwaymen, or the workers at Basra port, all of whom were in large measure won over to the party during Fahd's leadership.\n\nIn December 1943 to January 1944, the [[Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party]] held a congress and adopted party rules and a programme couched in moderate terms. Perhaps inspired by this example \u2013 although his relationship with [[Khalid Bakdash]], first secretary of the Syrian party and doyen of the communist movement in the [[Arab]] east, was never an easy one - Fahd relented on the question of holding a congress for the Iraqi party. A party conference met in March 1944 in Ali Shakar's house in the [[al-Shaikh 'Umar]] quarter of Baghdad and agreed a National Charter. It also adopted the Syrian party's slogan, ''[[A free homeland and a happy people]]'' (''watanun hurrun wa sha'bun sa'id''). The first party congress met a year later.\n\n==Arrest and imprisonment, 1947 - 1949==\nOn 18 January 1947 the police found Fahd and Zaki Bassim at the house of a party member, Ibrahim Bajir Shmayyel. All three were arrested and interrogated in the Central Baghdad Investigation Department, before being transferred to [[Abu Ghraib]] prison near the capital. Meanwhile, [[Yehuda Siddiq]] took over as \"first ''mas'ul''\" or comrade in charge. Fahd instructed him to hand over control to [[Malik Saif]], but he initially refused to obey.\n\nIn Abu Ghraib the three were held in appalling conditions, deprived of daylight for long periods. On 13 June they started a hunger strike in protest. The authorities finally brought the three communists for trial at the High Criminal Court on 20 June. They were charged with \"reliance on foreign sources of income\", \"contact with a foreign state\" and with \"the party of Khalid Bakdash\", designs subversive of the constitutional order and incitement to insurrection, and the propagation of communism along members of the armed forces. On the 23 June all three were found guilty and condemned to death.\n\nThe sentences created uproar, and the government backed down, commuting them to life imprisonment for Fahd and fifteen years for Bassim and Shmayyel. The three were transferred from the death row at Abu Ghraib to Baghdad Central Prison and then to [[Kut]] Prison.\n\nFrom Kut, Fahd was able to communicate regularly with the party. After the revolutionary episode of ''[[al-Wathbah]]'' (''the leap'' of January 1948 in Baghdad), he demanded constant activity. In line with his orders, the country was shaken by strikes and demonstrations between January and May. However, the agitation that took hold of Iraq on account of the Arab-[[Zionist]] conflict in Palestine distracted attention from issues that favoured the communists, and the party then lost considerable credibility when it accepted the Soviet Union's position in favour of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition of Palestine]].\n\nA graver setback yet came when, on 9 October 1948, a party member told police the location of the party's secret headquarters. The police raided the house and arrested Yehuda Siddiq, who after 28 days under torture broke down and told his interrogators that Malik Saif was the first ''mas'ul''. Saif, when interrogated, admitted everything. The government thus found out that Fahd was secretly directing the party from Kut prison, and it decided to dispose of him.\n\n==Death of Fahd==\nOn 10 February 1949, Fahd was court-martialled on a charge of organising communist activity from prison, along with Zaki Bassim and Muhammad Husain al-Sabibi. All three were sentenced to death. They were hanged on 13 and 14 February in public squares in Baghdad. Fahd was hanged in [[Karkh|al-Karkh]], in a square that was later named the Square of the New Museum. The bodies were left hanging for several hours as a warning to the populace. Fahd was then buried by the police in an unmarked grave in [[al-Mu'azzam cemetery]].\n\nThe death of Fahd appeared at the time to be a grave blow to the Iraqi communist movement. However, a few years later, the party was stronger than ever; a genuine mass movement, it seemed one of the most powerful political organisations of any Arab country. Fahd's organisational work, and the aura of martyrdom associated with his death at the hands of a deeply unpopular government, were essential factors in creating that movement.\n\n==Sources==\n{{no footnotes|date=December 2016}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*[[Hanna Batatu|Batatu, Hanna]], ''The Old Social Classes and New Revolutionary Movements of Iraq'', London, al-Saqi Books.\n*Ismail, Tariq, The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq, Cambridge University Press (2008).\n*Salucci, Ilario, A People's History of Iraq: The Iraqi Communist Party, Workers' Movements and the Left 1923-2004.

When asked what Bushwacker has meant to the PBR, Lambert took his remarks further. He immediately placed Bushwacker in an exclusive class of PBR legends, alongside others like the first and three-time World Champion [[Adriano Moraes]] or two-time World Champions [[Chris Shivers]] and [[Justin McBride]]. <blockquote>\"He is as important to the sport as any of the riders we have ever had and more famous than most of them and more well known,\" Lambert said. \"We will have all of the great bulls from now on, and all of the great bull riders from now on, and we will never replace Bushwacker or Chris Shivers or Justin McBride or Adriano.

It couldn\u2019t have happened to any better gentleman that I know than Julio Moreno.\" Mauney and Bushwacker met 13 times in Bushwacker's career.

Bushwacker would not be ridden again, and he retired after the PBR World Finals in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Out List for 13/6 Bushwacker (17903)|url=https://probullstats.com/bulls/outlist.php?bull=17903|website=probullstats.com|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}</ref> That record of 64 buck offs in 66 BFTS outs ranks him eighth in all-time buckoffs to date.<ref name=\"receivebrand\">{{cite web|title=Bushwacker to receive Brand of Honor|url=https://www.pbr.com/article/334671/bushwacker-receive-brand-honor|website=Professional Bull Riders|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref> His career BFTS buckoff percentage is 96.969 percent.<ref name=\"receivebrand\" /> He also earned an average bull score of 46.162 points.<ref name=\"receivebrand\" />\n\nThroughout his six-year BFTS elite career, Bushwacker \"became a world-famous superstar\". During his retirement in 2014, PBR co-founder and Director of Livestock [[Cody Lambert]] compared Bushwacker with other preeminent animal athletes [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and [[Seabiscuit]]. When asked what Bushwacker has meant to the PBR, Lambert took his remarks further. He immediately placed Bushwacker in an exclusive class of PBR legends, alongside others like the first and three-time World Champion [[Adriano Moraes]] or two-time World Champions [[Chris Shivers]] and [[Justin McBride]]. <blockquote>\"He is as important to the sport as any of the riders we have ever had and more famous than most of them and more well known,\" Lambert said. \"We will have all of the great bulls from now on, and all of the great bull riders from now on, and we will never replace Bushwacker or Chris Shivers or Justin McBride or Adriano. We have fans that don\u2019t know any of the riders' names that know Bushwacker,\" Lambert said. \"Lots of them. It's a level that no animal has taken it to so far \u2013 until Bushwacker.\"<ref name=\"honored\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Retirement ==\nMoreno retired Bushwacker from competition in October 2014 after winning his third World Champion Bull title.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2014/01/23/bull-riding-famed-bull-bushwacker-to-retire-october/4783145/ |title=Buck stops here: Famed bull Bushwacker to retire|work=usatoday.com |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> When the PBR awarded Bushwacker the PBR Brand of Honor, Julio brought him to \"accept\" the award in person in Las Vegas during the PBR World Finals in Oct-Nov 2016. The PBR actually built a stage for Bushwacker inside the [[South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa]] where the awards were held. This is the first time an animal has been on stage to receive an award for the PBR. J.B. Mauney attended and spoke fondly about his longtime rival.<ref name=\"surprise\">{{cite web|title=Bushwacker and Mauney team up for surprise|url=https://www.pbr.com/article/356586/bushwacker-and-mauney-team-surprise|website=Professional Bull Riders|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I hung on to him long enough for them to say I made the whistle, but in my eyes he is the greatest bucking bull there will ever be,\" Mauney said. \"People will raise bulls their entire life and they will never have a bull like Bushwacker. It couldn\u2019t have happened to any better gentleman that I know than Julio Moreno.\" Mauney and Bushwacker met 13 times in Bushwacker's career. Bushwacker bucked Mauney off in all but one of those rides. The always superstitious Moreno said, \"I thank J.B. J.B. was on him 13 times and Bushwacker\u2019s number is 13. It kind of worked out good like that.\"<ref name=\"surprise\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Honors ==\n* 2009 ABBI ([[American Bucking Bull]], Inc.)
