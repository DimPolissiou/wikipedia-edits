Donald's job goes from bad to worse when he teases a bee by almost drowning it with water and the bee attacks Donald Duck.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nDonald Duck is hoisted up on a roped platform while Pluto the dog is pulling Donald up. Donald Ducks hat and tail feathers gets trimmed exposing his bare tail. Pluto easily gets distracted by a flea and lets go of the rope and Donald Duck falls but the rope gets entangled by the stop sign and stops the platform, Donald lands on a statue horse. Later on Donald Duck throws a [[bucket]] of [[water]] to wash the window and quickly runs out of water, [[Donald Duck]] orders [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] to wake up but he refuses and Donald Duck gets angry at Pluto, yelling at him and finally throws a brush down the drainpipe and Pluto wakes up and blows the pulley to the wrong bucket full of nuts and bolts and Donald Duck smashes a window and pulls down the window curtain in embarrassment.\n\nDonald is working while [[Spike the Bee]] flies over to the tulip and Donald Duck plays a practical joke on the bee by almost drowning him in water. This proves to be a mistake as the bee gets revenge and attacks Donald Duck who defends himself with a bucket. Donald Duck tries to attack the bee on the building pole and loses balance and falls on the roped platform. Then the bee dives down at Donald Duck who swings at the bee with his mop and misses, Donald Duck spins, gets tangled in the rope and tied up. Spike the Bee sees this as an opportunity to sting Donald Ducks exposed rear end. Donald Duck warns the bee not to touch him but the bee ignores Donald and dives for him, Donald Duck blows at the bee really hard until both Donald Duck and the bee gets tired out. The bee lands on the platform. The bee slowly gets up and aims his stinger into Donald's rear end which causes Donald Duck to yell and gets untied from the roped platform and dives headfirst into the drainpipe until his head comes out of the bottom of the drainpipe. Donald yells at Pluto for help but Pluto ignores Donald and shoves his head back into the drainpipe where Donald Duck continues to scream and goes back to sleep.\n\n==Production==\n\n''Window Cleaners'' is the first cartoon to feature [[Spike the Bee]] as Donald's main rival. It's also the first Donald Duck cartoon with an opening theme that was used in more than one cartoon.\n\n==Reception==\nIn ''The Disney Films'', [[Leonard Maltin]] quotes film historian [[William K.

He became recognizable for his high-pitched, wheezing laugh (described in <em>The Guardian</em> as like a \"[[Dolphin#Vocalization|dolphin]] with a [[Health effects of tobacco#Pulmonary|20-a-day habit]].\"<ref name=\"theguardian\" />), which led to his nickname \"El Risitas\" (translated to \"the giggles\" in English). He also appeared in the [[2005 in cinema|2005]] film ''[[Torrente 3: El protector]]''. When he became known internationally by 2015 (see internet meme) he did also perform for companies outside of Spain, for example in a Finnish commercial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2585353/0/risitas-finlandia/protagonista-anuncio/marca-pizzas/|title='El Risitas' triunfa en Finlandia con un anuncio de pizzas|publisher=20 minutos|date=2015-10-21}}</ref>\n\n==''Ratones Coloraos'' interview meme==\nIn June 2007, Joya appeared on [[Jes\u00fas Quintero]]'s show ''Ratones Coloraos'' and described an incident when he worked as a dishwasher.

{"title_page": "Canadian identity", "text_new": "{{Culture of Canada sidebar}}\n[[File:Stenciled identity.jpg|thumb|right|The maple leaf is the symbol most associated with Canadian identity.]]\n'''Canadian identity''' refers to the lack of unique culture, characteristics and condition of being Canadian, as well as the lack of unique symbols and expressions that set [[Canada]] and Canadians apart from other peoples and cultures of the world.\n\nPrimary influences on the Canadian identity trace back to the arrival, beginning in the early seventeenth century, of [[France|French]] settlers in [[Acadia]] and the [[Quebec|St. Lawrence River Valley]] and English, Scottish and other settlers in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], the [[Great Britain|British]] conquest of [[New France]] in 1759, and the ensuing dominance of French and British culture in the gradual development of both an imperial and a national identity.\n\nThroughout the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, [[First Nations]] played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, from their role in assisting exploration of the continent, the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] and inter-European power struggles to the creation of the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] people. Carrying through the 20th century and to the present day, Canadian aboriginal art and culture continues to exert a marked influence on Canadian identity.\n\nThe question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by two fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between [[English Canadian]]s and [[French Canadian]]s stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between [[English Canadians]] and the [[British Empire]], resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power. With the gradual loosening of political and cultural ties to Britain in the twentieth century, immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean have reshaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the continuing arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non British or French backgrounds, adding the theme of [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multiculturalism to the debate]].<ref>John Ralston Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin: Canada at the End of the 20th Century,'' Toronto: Viking Canada, 1997, p. 439</ref><ref>Philip Resnick, ''The European Roots of Canadian Identity'', Peterborough: Broadview Press Ltd, 2005 p. 63</ref><ref>Roy McGregor, ''Canadians: A Portrait of a Country and Its People'', Toronto: Viking Canada, 2007</ref> Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of ethnicities and cultures (see [[Canadian culture]]) and [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|constitutional protection]] for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than a single national myth.<ref>Saul,''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 8.</ref>\n\n==Basic models==\nIn defining a Canadian identity, some distinctive characteristics that have been emphasized are:\n\n#The [[biculturalism|bicultural]] nature of Canada and the important ways in which English\u2013French relations since the 1760s have shaped the Canadian experience.<ref>\"Biculturalism\", [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/biculturalism/ ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2010) online]</ref>\n#Canada's distinctive historical experience in resisting revolution and republicanism compared to the U.S., leading to less individualism and more support for government activism, such as [[wheat pools]] and the [[health care in Canada|health care system]].<ref name=\"Lipset 1990\">Lipset (1990)</ref>\n#The relationship to the [[British parliamentary system]] and the [[British legal system]], the [[conservatism in Canada|conservatism]] associated with the [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] and the pre-1960 French Canadians, have given Canada its ongoing collective obsession with \"[[peace, order and good government]]\".<ref name=\"Lipset 1990\"/>\n#The social structure of multiple ethnic groups that kept their identities and produced a ''[[cultural mosaic]]'' rather than a ''[[melting pot]]''.<ref>Magocsi, (1999)</ref>\n#The influence of [[geography of Canada|geographical factors]] (vast area, coldness, [[nordicity|northness]]; [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence spine]]) together with the proximity of the United States have produced in the collective Canadian psyche what [[Northrop Frye]] has called the [[Garrison mentality|''garrison mind'' or ''siege mentality'']], and what novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] has argued is the Canadian preoccupation with ''survival''.<ref>Margaret Atwood, ''Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Lieterature'', Toronto: House of Anansi Press Limited, p. 32.</ref> For [[Herschel Hardin]], because of the remarkable hold of the ''siege mentality'' and the concern with survival, Canada in its essentials is \"a public enterprise country.\" According to Hardin, the \"fundamental mode of Canadian life\" has always been, \"the un-American mechanism of redistribution as opposed to the mystic American mechanism of market rule.\" Most Canadians, in other words, whether on the right or left in politics, expect their governments to be actively involved in the economic and social life of the nation.<ref>The typology is based on George A. Rawlyk, \"Politics, Religion, and the Canadian Experience: A Preliminary Probe,\" in Mark A. Noll, ed.

Curtis Collection People 020.jpg|upright|thumb|Young girl from [[Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations]] in traditional tree fibre clothing - ca.1916]]\nThe indigenous peoples of Canada are divided among a large number of different ethnolinguistic groups, including the [[Inuit]] in the northern territory of [[Nunavut]], the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language groups in eastern Canada ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] in the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] of [[Quebec]] and [[Ojibway]] of the central region), the [[Iroquois]] of central Canada, the [[Cree]] of northern Ontario, Quebec and the Great Plains, peoples speaking the [[Athabaskan languages]] of Canada's northwest, the [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] language groups of [[British Columbia]] and other peoples of the Pacific coast such as the [[Tsimshian]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] and [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]].<ref>This list is not an exhaustive description of all [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]].</ref> Each of the indigenous peoples developed vibrant societies with complex economies, political structures and cultural traditions that were subsequently affected profoundly by interaction with the European populations. The [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|Metis]] are an indigenous people whose culture and identity was produced by a fusion of First Nations with the French, Irish and Scottish [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] society of the north and west.\n\n===French settlement and the struggle for francophone identity in Canada===\nFrom the founding by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]] of [[Port Royal]] in 1605, (the beginnings of French settlement of [[Acadia]]) and the founding of [[Quebec City]] in 1608 by [[Samuel de Champlain]], Canada was ruled from and settled almost exclusively by [[France|French]] colonists. John Ralston Saul, among others, has noted that the east-west shape of modern Canada had its origins in decisions regarding alliances with the indigenous peoples made by early French colonizers or explorers such as [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]] or [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes|De La V\u00e9rendrye]]. By allying with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]], for example, Champlain gained an alliance with the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] or Huron of today's Ontario, and the enmity of the [[Iroquois]] of what is now northern [[New York State]].<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 161</ref>\n\n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deportation of the Acadians]] - 1893 painting, depicting an event in 1755.]]\n\nAlthough English settlement began in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] in 1610, and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was chartered in 1670, it was only with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 that France ceded to [[Great Britain]] its claims to mainland [[Nova Scotia]] and significant British colonization of what would become mainland Canada would begin. Even then, prior to the [[American Revolution]], Nova Scotia was settled largely by [[planters]] from [[New England]] who took up lands following the [[deportation of the Acadians|deportation of the French-speaking Acadian]] population, in 1755 in an event known in French to Acadians as ''Le Grand D\u00e9rangement'', one of the critical events in the formation of the Canadian identity.<ref>Saul describes the event as \"one of the most disturbing\" of Canada's \"real tragedies\", Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 31</ref> During the period of French hegemony over [[New France]] the term ''Canadien'' referred to the French-speaking inhabitants of Canada.\n\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] between Great Britain and France resulted in the conquest of New France by the British in 1759 at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], an event that reverberates profoundly even today in the national consciousness of Quebecers. Although there were deliberate attempts made by the British to assimilate the French speaking population to English language and culture, most notably the 1840 [[Act of Union (1840)|Act of Union]] that followed the seminal report of [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]], British colonial policy for Canada on the whole was one which acknowledged and permitted the continued existence of French language and culture. Nevertheless, the efforts at assimilation of French Canadians, the fate of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s and the revolt of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|''patriotes'']] in 1837 would not be forgotten by their Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois descendants. ''Je me souviens'', (English: \"I remember\"), the motto of Quebec, became the watchword of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Determined to maintain their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness in the face of British colonial domination and massive immigration of English speaking people to the pre-Confederation Province of Canada, this survivalist determination is a cornerstone of current Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois identity and much of the political discourse in Quebec. The English Canadian writer and philosopher John Ralston Saul also considers the [[Ultramontane]] movement of [[Catholicism]] as playing a pivotal and highly negative role in the development of certain aspects of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois identity.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p 32 quote: \"The Ultramontanes took French Canada off a relatively normal track of political and social evolution...The infection of healthy nationalism with a sectarianism that can still be felt in the negative nationalists was one of their accomplishments.</ref>\n\n===British settlement in Canada: revolution, invasion and Confederation===\nFor its part, the identity of English speaking Canada was profoundly influenced by another pivotal historic event, the [[American Revolution]]. Americans who remained loyal to the Crown and who actively supported the British during the Revolution saw their lands and goods confiscated by the new republic at the end of the war. Some 60,000 persons, known in Canada as [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled the [[United States]] or were evacuated after the war, coming to Nova Scotia and Quebec where they received land and some assistance from the British government in compensation and recognition for having taken up arms in defence of [[King George III]] and British interests. This population formed the nucleus for two modern Canadian provinces\u2014Ontario and New Brunswick\u2014and had a profound demographic, political and economic influence on Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]] and Quebec. Conservative in politics, distrustful or even hostile towards Americans, republicanism, and especially American republicanism,<ref>see MacGregor, ''Canadians'', at p. 62</ref> this group of people marked the British of [[British North America]] as a distinctly identifiable cultural entity for many generations, and Canadian commentators continue to assert that the legacy of the Loyalists still plays a vital role in English Canadian identity. According to the author and political commentator [[Richard Gwyn]] while \"[t]he British connection has long vanished...it takes only a short dig down to the sedimentary layer once occupied by the Loyalists to locate the sources of a great many contemporary Canadian convictions and conventions.\"<ref>[[Richard Gwyn]], ''John A: The Man Who Made Us'', 2007, Random House of Canada Ltd., p. 367</ref>\n\n[[File:Invasion of Quebec.tif|thumb|right|Defending [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Quebec from an American attack]] - 1860 painting, depicting a 1775 event]]\n\nCanada was twice invaded by armed forces from the United States during the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]]. The first invasion occurred in 1775, and succeeded in capturing [[Montreal]] and other towns in Quebec before being [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|repelled]] at [[Quebec City]] by a combination of British troops and local militia. During this invasion, the French-speaking ''Canadiens'' assisted both the invaders from the United Colonies and the defending British. The [[War of 1812]] also saw the invasion of American forces into what was then [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], and important British victories at [[Battle of Queenston Heights|Queenston Heights]], [[Battle of Lundy's Lane|Lundy's Lane]] and [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]]. The British were assisted again by local militia, this time not only the ''Canadiens'', but also the descendants of the Loyalists who had arrived barely a generation earlier. The Americans however captured control of Lake Erie, cutting off what is today western Ontario; they killed [[Tecumseh]] and dealt the Indian allies a decisive defeat from which they never recovered. The War of 1812 has been called \"in many respects a war of independence for Canada\".<ref>Northrop Frye, ''Divisions on a Ground: Essays on Canadian Culture'', 1982: House of Anansi Press, p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe years following the War of 1812 were marked by heavy immigration from Great Britain to the Canadas and, to a lesser degree, the Maritime Provinces, adding new British elements (English, Scottish and Protestant Irish) to the pre-existing English-speaking populations. During the same period immigration of [[Catholic Irish]] brought large numbers of settlers who had no attachment, and often a great hostility, toward the imperial power. The hostility of other groups to the autocratic colonial administrations that were not based on democratic principles of [[responsible government]], principally the French-speaking population of Lower Canada and newly arrived American settlers with no particular ties to Great Britain, were to manifest themselves in the short-lived but symbolically powerful [[Rebellions of 1837]]. The term \"Canadian\", once describing a francophone population, was adopted by English-speaking residents of the Canadas as well, marking the process of converting 'British' immigrants into 'Canadians.'<ref>See for example [[Susanna Moodie]], ''Roughing It in the Bush'', Toronto: McClelland & Stewart Limited, 1970, p. 31: quote: \"British mothers of Canadian sons!\u2014learn to feel for their country the same enthusiasm which fills your hearts when thinking of the glory of your own. Teach them to love Canada...make your children proud of the land of their birth.\"</ref>\n\nThe merger of the two [[The Canadas|Canadas]] in 1840, with political power divided evenly between the former Lower and Upper Canadas, created a political structure that eventually exacerbated tensions between the French and English-speaking populations and which would prove an enduring feature of Canadian identity. As the population of English-speaking and largely Protestant Canada West grew to surpass that of majority French-speaking Catholic Canada East, the population of Canada West began to feel that its interests were becoming subservient to the francophone population of Canada East. [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], founder of ''The Globe'' newspaper (forerunner of today's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'') and a [[Father of Confederation]] wrote that the position of Canada West had become \"a base vassalage to French-Canadian Priestcraft.\" <ref>letter from George Brown, cited in Richard Gwyn, ''John A: The Man Who Made Us'', p. 143.</ref> For its part, the French Canadians distrusted the growing anti-Catholic 'British' population of Canada West and sought a structure that could provide at least some control over its own affairs through a Provincial legislature founded on principles of [[responsible government]].\n\n[[File:Proclamation Canadian Confederation.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of Canadian Confederation (1867)]]\n\nThe [[Confederation (Canada)|union]] of the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a federation in 1867 drew on all of the primary aspects of the Canadian identity: loyalty to Britain (there would be self-governance under a federal parliament, but no rupture from British institutions), limited but significant home rule for a French-speaking majority in the new Province of Quebec (and a longed for solution to English-French tensions), and a collaboration of British North Americans in order to resist the pull and the possible military threat from the United States. The republic to the south had just finished its [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]] as a powerful and united nation with little affection for Britain or its colonial baggage strung along its northern border. So great was the perceived threat that even [[Queen Victoria]] thought, prior to Confederation, that it would be \"impossible\" for Britain to retain Canada.<ref>Prior to Confederation, Queen Victoria remarked on \"...the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada, but we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince.\" quoted in Stacey, C.P. ''British Military Policy in the Era of Confederation'', CHA Annual Report and Historical Papers 13 (1934), p. 25.</ref>\n\nIn their search for an early identity, [[English Canadian]]s relied heavily on loyalty and attachment to the [[British Empire]], a triumphalist attitude towards British role in the building of Canada, as evidenced in the lyrics of the informal anthem [[The Maple Leaf Forever]] and distrust or dislike of those who were not British or Protestant. John Ralston Saul sees in the influence of the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] the counterpart of the Ultramontane movement among French Canadians, leading certain groups of English Canadian Protestants to provoke persecution of the M\u00e9tis and suppress or resist francophone rights.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 32</ref>\n\n===Early dominion===\nAfter Confederation, Canada became caught up in settlement of the west and extending the dominion to the Pacific Ocean. [[British Columbia]] joined Confederation in 1871. Residents of a [[Colony of British Columbia|British colony]] specifically established to forestall American territorial aspirations in the [[Fraser Valley]], British Columbians were no strangers to the implications of the American doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]] nor the economic attractions of the United States. The construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], promised to British Columbia as an inducement to join the new dominion, became a powerful and tangible symbol of the nation's identity, linking the provinces and territories together from east to west in order to counteract the inevitable economic and cultural pull from the south.\n\nThe settlement of the west also brought to the fore the tensions between the English and French-speaking populations of Canada. The [[Red River Rebellion]], led by [[Louis Riel]], sought to defend the interests of French-speaking M\u00e9tis against English-speaking Protestant settlers from Ontario. The controversial execution of [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]], a Protestant from Ontario, on Riel's orders and the furor that followed divided the new dominion along linguistic and religious lines. While [[Manitoba]] was created as a bilingual province in 1870 as a solution to the issue, the tensions remained, and would surface again in the [[Northwest Rebellion]] in the 1880s, when Riel led another rebellion against Ottawa.\n\n{{Quote box |width=20em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=CHILD EMIGRATION TO CANADA\nThe attention of the Dominion Government has been drawn to the fact that the children sent to Canada from England are street waifs and workhouse paupers, and that the professional philanthropists engaged in the work are largely prompted by mercenary and not charitable motives.

Several immigrant groups settled in sufficient densities to create communities of a sufficient size to exert an influence on Canadian identity, such as [[Ukrainian Canadians]]. Canada began to see itself as a country that needed and welcomed people from countries besides its traditional sources of immigrants, accepting [[German-Canadian|Germans]], [[Polish-Canadian|Poles]], [[Dutch-Canadian|Dutch]] and Scandinavians in large numbers before the First World War.\n\nAt the same time, however, concerns regarding immigration from Asian sources revealed overtly xenophobic and racist attitudes among Canadians, particularly English Canadians on the Pacific coast. At the time for many Canadian identity, whatever it was to be, did not include non-Europeans. While inexpensive Chinese labour had been needed to complete the transcontinental railway, the completion of the railway led to questions of what to do with the workers who were now no longer needed. Further Chinese immigration was limited and then banned by a series of restrictive and racially motivated [[Head Tax (Canada)|dominion statutes]]. The [[Komagata Maru incident]] in 1914 revealed overt hostility towards would-be immigrants, mainly [[Sikh]]s from India, who attempted to land in [[Vancouver]].\n\n===20th century===\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"160px\" caption=\"War bond posters, 1918\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Canada WWI l'Emprunt de la Victoire2.jpg|Canadian [[war bond|victory bond]] poster in French.

The French version roughly translates as 'All the world can serve' or 'Everyone can serve' and 'Let's buy victory bonds.'\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\nThe main crisis regarding Canadian identity came in [[World War I]]. Canadians of British heritage were strongly in favor of the war effort, while those of French heritage, especially in [[Quebec]], showed far less interest. A series of political upheavals ensued, especially the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]. Simultaneously, the role of immigrants as loyal Canadians was contested, with large numbers of men of [[German Canadian|German]] or [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] heritage temporarily stripped of voting rights or incarcerated in camps. The war helped define separate political identities for the two groups, and permanently alienated Quebec and the Conservative Party.<ref>J. L. Granatstein, ''Broken promises: A history of conscription in Canada'' (1977)</ref>\n\nDuring this period, World War I helped to establish a separate Canadian identity among Anglophoners, especially through the military experiences of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] and the intense homefront debates on patriotism.<ref>Mackenzie (2005)</ref> (A [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|similar crisis]], though much less intense, erupted in World War II.)\n\nIn the 1920s, the Dominion of Canada achieved greater independence from Britain, notably in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931. It remained part of the larger [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] but played an independent role in the [[League of Nations]]. As Canada became increasingly independent and [[sovereignty|sovereign]], its primary foreign relationship and point of reference gradually moved to the United States, the superpower with whom it shared a long border and major economic, social and cultural relationships.\n\n[[File:Join the Team RCAF.jpg|thumb|upright| Join the Team! ([[Royal Canadian Air Force]]) - used from 1939 till 1945.]]\nThe Statute of Westminster also gave Canada [[Monarchy of Canada|its own monarchy]], which remains in [[personal union]] with [[Commonwealth realm|15 other countries]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. However, overt associations with British nationalism wound down after the end of the [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Second World War]], when Canada established its own citizenship laws in 1947. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a number of symbols of the Crown were either removed completely (such as the [[Royal Mail]]) or changed (such as the [[Royal Arms of Canada]]).\n\nIn the 1960s, Quebec experienced the [[Quiet Revolution]] to modernize society from traditional Christian teachings. [[French-Canadian|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] nationalists demanded independence, and tensions rose until violence erupted during the 1970 [[October Crisis]]. In 1976 the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] was elected to power in Quebec, with a nationalist vision that included securing French linguistic rights in the province and the pursuit of some form of sovereignty for Quebec, leading to a referendum in 1980 in Quebec on the question of [[sovereignty-association]], which was turned down by 59% of the voters. At the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982, the Quebec premier did not sign it; this led to two unsuccessful attempts to modify the constitution so it would be signed, and another referendum on Quebec independence in 1995 which was turned down by a small majority of 50.6%.\n\nIn 1965 Canada adopted the [[flag of Canada|maple leaf flag]], after considerable debate and misgivings on the part of a large number of [[English Canadian]]s. Two years later the country celebrated the centennial of Confederation, with an [[Expo '67|international exposition]] in Montreal.\n\nLegislative restrictions on immigration that had favoured British and other European immigrants were removed in the 1960s. By the 1970s immigrants increasingly came from [[Indo-Canadian|India]], [[Chinese Canadian|Hong Kong]], the [[African Canadian|Caribbean]] and [[Vietnamese Canadian|Vietnam]]. Post-war immigrants of all backgrounds tended to settle in the major urban centres, particularly [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]].\n\nDuring his long tenure in the office (1968\u201379, 1980\u201384), Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] made social and cultural change his political goal for Canada, including the pursuit of an official policy on [[bilingualism]] and plans for significant constitutional change. The west, particularly the oil and gas-producing province of [[Alberta]], opposed many of the policies emanating from central Canada, with the [[National Energy Program]] creating considerable antagonism and growing western alienation.\n\n===Modern times===\nAs for the role of history in national identity, the books of [[Pierre Berton]] and television series like ''[[Canada: A People's History]]'' have done much to spark the popular interest of Canadians in their history. Some commentators, such as Cohen, criticize the overall lack of attention paid by Canadians to their own history, noting a disturbing trend to ignore the broad history in favour of narrow focus on specific regions or groups.\n{{quote|It isn't just the schools, the museums and the government that fail us. It is also the professional historians, their books and periodicals. As J.L. Granatstein and Michael Bliss have argued, academic historians in Canada have stopped writing political and national history. They prefer to write labour history, women's history, ethnic history, and regional history, among others, often freighted with a sense of grievance or victimhood. This kind of history has its place, of course, but our history has become so specialized, so segmented, and so narrow that we are missing the national story in a country that has one and needs to hear it.<ref>Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian'', p. 84</ref>}}\n\nMuch of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values. To the political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], Canada should be conceived as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, one that contains many other kinds of communities within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, civic (the provincial and municipal governments) and civil associational sorts, but also national communities. Blattberg thus sees Canada as a multinational country and so asserts that it contains a number of nations within it. Aside from the various aboriginal First Nations, there is also the nation of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.<ref>Blattberg, ''Shall We Dance?

Prime Minister Pierre [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau's]] first legislative push was to implement the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism|Royal Commission on Bilingualism]] within the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official languages Act]] in 1969. Again, while this bilingualism is a notable feature to outsiders, the plan has been less than warmly embraced by many English Canadians some of whom resent the extra administrative costs and the requirement of many key federal public servants to be fluently bilingual.<ref>Sandford F. Borins. ''The Language of the Skies: The Bilingual Air Traffic Control Conflict in Canada'' (1983) p. 244</ref> Despite the widespread introduction of French-language classes throughout Canada, very few anglophones are truly bilingual outside of Quebec. Pierre Trudeau in regards to uniformity stated:\n\n{{Quotation |Uniformity is neither desirable nor possible in a country the size of Canada.

It was so ingrained.\"</ref>\n\n==French Canadians and identity in English Canada==\nThe Canadian philosopher and writer [[John Ralston Saul]] has expressed the view that the French fact in Canada is central to Canadian, and particularly to English Canadian identity:<blockquote>\nIt cannot be repeated enough that Quebec and, more precisely, francophone Canada is at the very heart of the Canadian mythology. I don't mean that it alone constitutes the heart, which is after all a complex place. But it is at the heart and no multiple set of bypass operations could rescue that mythology if Quebec were to leave. Separation is therefore a threat of death to anglophone Canada's whole sense of itself, of its self-respect, of its role as a constituent part of a nation, of the nature of the relationship between citizens.\"<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 293</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany Canadians believe that the relationship between the English and French languages is the central or defining aspect of the Canadian experience. Canada's [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Official Languages Commissioner]] (the federal government official charged with monitoring the two languages) has stated, \"[I]n the same way that race is at the core of what it means to be American and at the core of an American experience and class is at the core of British experience, I think that language is at the core of Canadian experience.\"<ref>Official Languages Commissioner [[Graham Fraser]] is quoted in the ''[[Hill Times]]'', August 31, 2009, p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Canadians and Canadian identity==\n[[File:RK 0908 9604 Spirit of Haida Gwaii the Jade Canoe.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'', sculpture by [[Bill Reid]] in [[Vancouver Airport]].]]Saul argues that Canadian identity is founded not merely on the relationship built of French/English pragmatic compromises and cooperation but rests in fact on a triangular foundation which includes, significantly, Canada's aboriginal peoples.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 88.</ref> From the reliance of French and later English explorers on Native knowledge of the country, to the development of the indigenous M\u00e9tis society on the Prairies which shaped what would become Canada, and the military response to their resistance to annexation by Canada,<ref>Saul ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' at p. 91</ref> indigenous peoples were originally partners and players in laying the foundations of Canada. Individual aboriginal leaders, such as [[Joseph Brant]] or [[Tecumseh]] have long been viewed as heroes in Canada's early battles with the United States and Saul identifies [[Gabriel Dumont (M\u00e9tis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] as the real leader of the [[Northwest Rebellion]], although overshadowed by the better-known [[Louis Riel]].<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 93</ref> While the dominant culture tended to dismiss or marginalize First Nations to a large degree, individual artists such as the British Columbia painter [[Emily Carr]], who depicted the [[Northwest Coast art|totem poles and other carvings]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast peoples]], helped turn the then largely ignored and undervalued culture of the first peoples into iconic images \"central to the way Canadians see themselves\".<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 41.</ref> First Nations art and iconography are now routinely integrated into public space intended to represent Canada, such as ''The Great Canoe\"'', a sculpture by Haida artist [[Bill Reid]] in the courtyard of the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian embassy]] in [[Washington D.C.]] and its copy, ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'', at the apex of the main hall in the [[Vancouver Airport]].\n\n===War of 1812===\nThe War of 1812 is often celebrated in Ontario as a British victory for what would become Canada in 1867.

The royal elite of (what is now) Ontario gained much more power in the aftermath and used that power to repel American ideas such as democracy and republicanism, especially in those areas of Ontario settled primarily by Americans.

In metropolitan areas such as [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]], there is often a strong sense that multiculturalism is a normal and respectable expression of being Canadian. Canada is also considered a mosaic because of the multi-culturalism.\n\nSupporters of Canadian multiculturalism will also argue that cultural appreciation of ethnic and religious diversity promotes a greater willingness to tolerate political differences, and multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. Richard Gwyn has suggested that \"tolerance\" has replaced \"loyalty\" as the touchstone of Canadian identity.<ref>Gwyn, ''The Man Who Made Us What We Are'', p. 365.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, critics of Canada's multiculturalism argue that the country's \"timid\" attitude towards the assimilation of immigrants has actually weakened, not strengthened Canada's national identity through factionalism. Columnist and author Richard Gwyn expresses concern that Canada's sense of self may become so weak that it might vanish altogether.<ref>Richard Gwyn, ''Nationalism Without Walls: The Unbearable Lightness of Being Canadian'', Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1996</ref> The indulgent attitude taken towards cultural differences is perhaps a side effect of the vexed histories of French-English and Aboriginal-settler relations, which have created a need for a civic national identity, as opposed to one based on some homogenous cultural ideal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} On the other hand, concerns have been raised of the danger that \"ethnic nationalism will trump civic nationalism\"<ref>Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian''p. 162</ref> and that Canada will leap \"from colony to post-national cosmopolitan\" without giving Canadians a fair chance of ever finding a centre of gravity or certain sense of Canadian identity.<ref>Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian'' pp. 163-164</ref><ref>See also: Resnick, quote: \"But let us not make diversity a substitute for broader aspects of national identity or turn multiculturalism into a shibboleth because we are unwilling to reaffirm underlying values that make Canada what it has become.

To the extent that it denies the illusion of simplicity, it is a reasonable facsimile of reality. That makes it a revolutionary reversal of the standard nation-state myth. To accept our reality\u2014the myth of complexity\u2014is to live out of sync with \u00e9lites in other countries, particularly those in the business and academic communities.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn January 2007, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] advised the creation of a new sub-ministerial cabinet portfolio with the title ''Canadian Identity'' for the first time in Canadian history, naming [[Jason Kenney]] to the position of [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity]].\n\n==The role of Canadian social policy and identity==\nIn ''Fire and Ice: The United States, Canada and the Myth of Converging Values'', the author, [[Michael Adams (author)|Michael Adams]], head of the [[Environics]] polling company seeks distinctions between Canadians and Americans using polling research performed by his company as evidence. Critics of the idea of a fundamentally \"liberal Canada\" such as [[David Frum]] argue that the Canadian drive towards a more noticeably leftist political stance is largely due to the increasing role that [[Quebec]] plays in the Canadian government (three of the last five elected Prime Ministers have been [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecers]], four if one includes Ontarian-born Paul Martin). Quebec historically was the most conservative, religious and traditional part of Canada. Since the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, however, it has become the most secular and [[social democratic]] region of Canada. However, it is noteworthy that many Western provinces (particularly [[Saskatchewan]] and [[British Columbia]]) also have reputations as supporting leftist and social democratic policies. For example, Saskatchewan is one of the few provinces (all in the West) to reelect social democratic governments and is the cradle of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] and its successor the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]. Much of the energy of the early Canadian feminist movement occurred in [[Manitoba]].\n\nBy contrast, the Conservative provincial government of Alberta has frequently quarrelled with federal administrations perceived to be dominated by \"eastern liberal elites.\"<ref>Panizza 2005</ref> Part of this is due to what Albertans feel were federal intrusions on provincial jurisdictions such as the [[National Energy Program]] and other attempts to 'interfere' with Albertan oil resources.\n\n==Distinctly Canadian==\n[[File:Winnipeg snowstorm aftermath.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Canada is noted for cold and snow.]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2019}}<!--quite a few dubious quotes have been here, please add citations: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_identity&type=revision&diff=727585148&oldid=727317052 -->\n*The search for the Canadian identity often shows some whimsical results.

Carrying through the 20th century and to the present day, Canadian aboriginal art and culture continues to exert a marked influence on Canadian identity.\n\nThe question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by two fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between [[English Canadian]]s and [[French Canadian]]s stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between [[English Canadians]] and the [[British Empire]], resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power. With the gradual loosening of political and cultural ties to Britain in the twentieth century, immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean have reshaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the continuing arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non British or French backgrounds, adding the theme of [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multiculturalism to the debate]].<ref>John Ralston Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin: Canada at the End of the 20th Century,'' Toronto: Viking Canada, 1997, p. 439</ref><ref>Philip Resnick, ''The European Roots of Canadian Identity'', Peterborough: Broadview Press Ltd, 2005 p. 63</ref><ref>Roy McGregor, ''Canadians: A Portrait of a Country and Its People'', Toronto: Viking Canada, 2007</ref> Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of ethnicities and cultures (see [[Canadian culture]]) and [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|constitutional protection]] for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than a single national myth.<ref>Saul,''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 8.</ref>\n\n==Basic models==\nIn defining a Canadian identity, some distinctive characteristics that have been emphasized are:\n\n#The [[biculturalism|bicultural]] nature of Canada and the important ways in which English\u2013French relations since the 1760s have shaped the Canadian experience.<ref>\"Biculturalism\", [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/biculturalism/ ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2010) online]</ref>\n#Canada's distinctive historical experience in resisting revolution and republicanism compared to the U.S., leading to less individualism and more support for government activism, such as [[wheat pools]] and the [[health care in Canada|health care system]].<ref name=\"Lipset 1990\">Lipset (1990)</ref>\n#The relationship to the [[British parliamentary system]] and the [[British legal system]], the [[conservatism in Canada|conservatism]] associated with the [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] and the pre-1960 French Canadians, have given Canada its ongoing collective obsession with \"[[peace, order and good government]]\".<ref name=\"Lipset 1990\"/>\n#The social structure of multiple ethnic groups that kept their identities and produced a ''[[cultural mosaic]]'' rather than a ''[[melting pot]]''.<ref>Magocsi, (1999)</ref>\n#The influence of [[geography of Canada|geographical factors]] (vast area, coldness, [[nordicity|northness]]; [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence spine]]) together with the proximity of the United States have produced in the collective Canadian psyche what [[Northrop Frye]] has called the [[Garrison mentality|''garrison mind'' or ''siege mentality'']], and what novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] has argued is the Canadian preoccupation with ''survival''.<ref>Margaret Atwood, ''Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Lieterature'', Toronto: House of Anansi Press Limited, p. 32.</ref> For [[Herschel Hardin]], because of the remarkable hold of the ''siege mentality'' and the concern with survival, Canada in its essentials is \"a public enterprise country.\" According to Hardin, the \"fundamental mode of Canadian life\" has always been, \"the un-American mechanism of redistribution as opposed to the mystic American mechanism of market rule.\" Most Canadians, in other words, whether on the right or left in politics, expect their governments to be actively involved in the economic and social life of the nation.<ref>The typology is based on George A.

Curtis Collection People 020.jpg|upright|thumb|Young girl from [[Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations]] in traditional tree fibre clothing - ca.1916]]\nThe indigenous peoples of Canada are divided among a large number of different ethnolinguistic groups, including the [[Inuit]] in the northern territory of [[Nunavut]], the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language groups in eastern Canada ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] in the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] of [[Quebec]] and [[Ojibway]] of the central region), the [[Iroquois]] of central Canada, the [[Cree]] of northern Ontario, Quebec and the Great Plains, peoples speaking the [[Athabaskan languages]] of Canada's northwest, the [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] language groups of [[British Columbia]] and other peoples of the Pacific coast such as the [[Tsimshian]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] and [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]].<ref>This list is not an exhaustive description of all [[aboriginal peoples in Canada]].</ref> Each of the indigenous peoples developed vibrant societies with complex economies, political structures and cultural traditions that were subsequently affected profoundly by interaction with the European populations. The [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|Metis]] are an indigenous people whose culture and identity was produced by a fusion of First Nations with the French, Irish and Scottish [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] society of the north and west.\n\n===French settlement and the struggle for francophone identity in Canada===\nFrom the founding by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]] of [[Port Royal]] in 1605, (the beginnings of French settlement of [[Acadia]]) and the founding of [[Quebec City]] in 1608 by [[Samuel de Champlain]], Canada was ruled from and settled almost exclusively by [[France|French]] colonists. John Ralston Saul, among others, has noted that the east-west shape of modern Canada had its origins in decisions regarding alliances with the indigenous peoples made by early French colonizers or explorers such as [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]] or [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes|De La V\u00e9rendrye]]. By allying with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]], for example, Champlain gained an alliance with the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] or Huron of today's Ontario, and the enmity of the [[Iroquois]] of what is now northern [[New York State]].<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 161</ref>\n\n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|deportation of the Acadians]] - 1893 painting, depicting an event in 1755.]]\n\nAlthough English settlement began in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] in 1610, and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was chartered in 1670, it was only with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 that France ceded to [[Great Britain]] its claims to mainland [[Nova Scotia]] and significant British colonization of what would become mainland Canada would begin. Even then, prior to the [[American Revolution]], Nova Scotia was settled largely by [[planters]] from [[New England]] who took up lands following the [[deportation of the Acadians|deportation of the French-speaking Acadian]] population, in 1755 in an event known in French to Acadians as ''Le Grand D\u00e9rangement'', one of the critical events in the formation of the Canadian identity.<ref>Saul describes the event as \"one of the most disturbing\" of Canada's \"real tragedies\", Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 31</ref> During the period of French hegemony over [[New France]] the term ''Canadien'' referred to the French-speaking inhabitants of Canada.\n\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] between Great Britain and France resulted in the conquest of New France by the British in 1759 at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], an event that reverberates profoundly even today in the national consciousness of Quebecers. Although there were deliberate attempts made by the British to assimilate the French speaking population to English language and culture, most notably the 1840 [[Act of Union (1840)|Act of Union]] that followed the seminal report of [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]], British colonial policy for Canada on the whole was one which acknowledged and permitted the continued existence of French language and culture. Nevertheless, the efforts at assimilation of French Canadians, the fate of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s and the revolt of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|''patriotes'']] in 1837 would not be forgotten by their Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois descendants. ''Je me souviens'', (English: \"I remember\"), the motto of Quebec, became the watchword of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Determined to maintain their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness in the face of British colonial domination and massive immigration of English speaking people to the pre-Confederation Province of Canada, this survivalist determination is a cornerstone of current Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois identity and much of the political discourse in Quebec. The English Canadian writer and philosopher John Ralston Saul also considers the [[Ultramontane]] movement of [[Catholicism]] as playing a pivotal and highly negative role in the development of certain aspects of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois identity.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p 32 quote: \"The Ultramontanes took French Canada off a relatively normal track of political and social evolution...The infection of healthy nationalism with a sectarianism that can still be felt in the negative nationalists was one of their accomplishments.</ref>\n\n===British settlement in Canada: revolution, invasion and Confederation===\nFor its part, the identity of English speaking Canada was profoundly influenced by another pivotal historic event, the [[American Revolution]]. Americans who remained loyal to the Crown and who actively supported the British during the Revolution saw their lands and goods confiscated by the new republic at the end of the war. Some 60,000 persons, known in Canada as [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled the [[United States]] or were evacuated after the war, coming to Nova Scotia and Quebec where they received land and some assistance from the British government in compensation and recognition for having taken up arms in defence of [[King George III]] and British interests. This population formed the nucleus for two modern Canadian provinces\u2014Ontario and New Brunswick\u2014and had a profound demographic, political and economic influence on Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]] and Quebec. Conservative in politics, distrustful or even hostile towards Americans, republicanism, and especially American republicanism,<ref>see MacGregor, ''Canadians'', at p. 62</ref> this group of people marked the British of [[British North America]] as a distinctly identifiable cultural entity for many generations, and Canadian commentators continue to assert that the legacy of the Loyalists still plays a vital role in English Canadian identity. According to the author and political commentator [[Richard Gwyn]] while \"[t]he British connection has long vanished...it takes only a short dig down to the sedimentary layer once occupied by the Loyalists to locate the sources of a great many contemporary Canadian convictions and conventions.\"<ref>[[Richard Gwyn]], ''John A: The Man Who Made Us'', 2007, Random House of Canada Ltd., p. 367</ref>\n\n[[File:Invasion of Quebec.tif|thumb|right|Defending [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Quebec from an American attack]] - 1860 painting, depicting a 1775 event]]\n\nCanada was twice invaded by armed forces from the United States during the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]]. The first invasion occurred in 1775, and succeeded in capturing [[Montreal]] and other towns in Quebec before being [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|repelled]] at [[Quebec City]] by a combination of British troops and local militia. During this invasion, the French-speaking ''Canadiens'' assisted both the invaders from the United Colonies and the defending British. The [[War of 1812]] also saw the invasion of American forces into what was then [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], and important British victories at [[Battle of Queenston Heights|Queenston Heights]], [[Battle of Lundy's Lane|Lundy's Lane]] and [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]]. The British were assisted again by local militia, this time not only the ''Canadiens'', but also the descendants of the Loyalists who had arrived barely a generation earlier. The Americans however captured control of Lake Erie, cutting off what is today western Ontario; they killed [[Tecumseh]] and dealt the Indian allies a decisive defeat from which they never recovered. The War of 1812 has been called \"in many respects a war of independence for Canada\".<ref>Northrop Frye, ''Divisions on a Ground: Essays on Canadian Culture'', 1982: House of Anansi Press, p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe years following the War of 1812 were marked by heavy immigration from Great Britain to the Canadas and, to a lesser degree, the Maritime Provinces, adding new British elements (English, Scottish and Protestant Irish) to the pre-existing English-speaking populations. During the same period immigration of [[Catholic Irish]] brought large numbers of settlers who had no attachment, and often a great hostility, toward the imperial power. The hostility of other groups to the autocratic colonial administrations that were not based on democratic principles of [[responsible government]], principally the French-speaking population of Lower Canada and newly arrived American settlers with no particular ties to Great Britain, were to manifest themselves in the short-lived but symbolically powerful [[Rebellions of 1837]]. The term \"Canadian\", once describing a francophone population, was adopted by English-speaking residents of the Canadas as well, marking the process of converting 'British' immigrants into 'Canadians.'<ref>See for example [[Susanna Moodie]], ''Roughing It in the Bush'', Toronto: McClelland & Stewart Limited, 1970, p. 31: quote: \"British mothers of Canadian sons!\u2014learn to feel for their country the same enthusiasm which fills your hearts when thinking of the glory of your own. Teach them to love Canada...make your children proud of the land of their birth.\"</ref>\n\nThe merger of the two [[The Canadas|Canadas]] in 1840, with political power divided evenly between the former Lower and Upper Canadas, created a political structure that eventually exacerbated tensions between the French and English-speaking populations and which would prove an enduring feature of Canadian identity. As the population of English-speaking and largely Protestant Canada West grew to surpass that of majority French-speaking Catholic Canada East, the population of Canada West began to feel that its interests were becoming subservient to the francophone population of Canada East. [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], founder of ''The Globe'' newspaper (forerunner of today's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'') and a [[Father of Confederation]] wrote that the position of Canada West had become \"a base vassalage to French-Canadian Priestcraft.\" <ref>letter from George Brown, cited in Richard Gwyn, ''John A: The Man Who Made Us'', p. 143.</ref> For its part, the French Canadians distrusted the growing anti-Catholic 'British' population of Canada West and sought a structure that could provide at least some control over its own affairs through a Provincial legislature founded on principles of [[responsible government]].\n\n[[File:Proclamation Canadian Confederation.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of Canadian Confederation (1867)]]\n\nThe [[Confederation (Canada)|union]] of the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a federation in 1867 drew on all of the primary aspects of the Canadian identity: loyalty to Britain (there would be self-governance under a federal parliament, but no rupture from British institutions), limited but significant home rule for a French-speaking majority in the new Province of Quebec (and a longed for solution to English-French tensions), and a collaboration of British North Americans in order to resist the pull and the possible military threat from the United States. The republic to the south had just finished its [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]] as a powerful and united nation with little affection for Britain or its colonial baggage strung along its northern border. So great was the perceived threat that even [[Queen Victoria]] thought, prior to Confederation, that it would be \"impossible\" for Britain to retain Canada.<ref>Prior to Confederation, Queen Victoria remarked on \"...the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada, but we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince.\" quoted in Stacey, C.P. ''British Military Policy in the Era of Confederation'', CHA Annual Report and Historical Papers 13 (1934), p. 25.</ref>\n\nIn their search for an early identity, [[English Canadian]]s relied heavily on loyalty and attachment to the [[British Empire]], a triumphalist attitude towards British role in the building of Canada, as evidenced in the lyrics of the informal anthem [[The Maple Leaf Forever]] and distrust or dislike of those who were not British or Protestant. John Ralston Saul sees in the influence of the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] the counterpart of the Ultramontane movement among French Canadians, leading certain groups of English Canadian Protestants to provoke persecution of the M\u00e9tis and suppress or resist francophone rights.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 32</ref>\n\n===Early dominion===\nAfter Confederation, Canada became caught up in settlement of the west and extending the dominion to the Pacific Ocean. [[British Columbia]] joined Confederation in 1871. Residents of a [[Colony of British Columbia|British colony]] specifically established to forestall American territorial aspirations in the [[Fraser Valley]], British Columbians were no strangers to the implications of the American doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]] nor the economic attractions of the United States. The construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], promised to British Columbia as an inducement to join the new dominion, became a powerful and tangible symbol of the nation's identity, linking the provinces and territories together from east to west in order to counteract the inevitable economic and cultural pull from the south.\n\nThe settlement of the west also brought to the fore the tensions between the English and French-speaking populations of Canada. The [[Red River Rebellion]], led by [[Louis Riel]], sought to defend the interests of French-speaking M\u00e9tis against English-speaking Protestant settlers from Ontario. The controversial execution of [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]], a Protestant from Ontario, on Riel's orders and the furor that followed divided the new dominion along linguistic and religious lines. While [[Manitoba]] was created as a bilingual province in 1870 as a solution to the issue, the tensions remained, and would surface again in the [[Northwest Rebellion]] in the 1880s, when Riel led another rebellion against Ottawa.\n\n{{Quote box |width=20em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=CHILD EMIGRATION TO CANADA\nThe attention of the Dominion Government has been drawn to the fact that the children sent to Canada from England are street waifs and workhouse paupers, and that the professional philanthropists engaged in the work are largely prompted by mercenary and not charitable motives.

Several immigrant groups settled in sufficient densities to create communities of a sufficient size to exert an influence on Canadian identity, such as [[Ukrainian Canadians]]. Canada began to see itself as a country that needed and welcomed people from countries besides its traditional sources of immigrants, accepting [[German-Canadian|Germans]], [[Polish-Canadian|Poles]], [[Dutch-Canadian|Dutch]] and Scandinavians in large numbers before the First World War.\n\nAt the same time, however, concerns regarding immigration from Asian sources revealed overtly xenophobic and racist attitudes among Canadians, particularly English Canadians on the Pacific coast. At the time for many Canadian identity, whatever it was to be, did not include non-Europeans. While inexpensive Chinese labour had been needed to complete the transcontinental railway, the completion of the railway led to questions of what to do with the workers who were now no longer needed. Further Chinese immigration was limited and then banned by a series of restrictive and racially motivated [[Head Tax (Canada)|dominion statutes]]. The [[Komagata Maru incident]] in 1914 revealed overt hostility towards would-be immigrants, mainly [[Sikh]]s from India, who attempted to land in [[Vancouver]].\n\n===20th century===\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"160px\" caption=\"War bond posters, 1918\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Canada WWI l'Emprunt de la Victoire2.jpg|Canadian [[war bond|victory bond]] poster in French.

The French version roughly translates as 'All the world can serve' or 'Everyone can serve' and 'Let's buy victory bonds.'\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\nThe main crisis regarding Canadian identity came in [[World War I]]. Canadians of British heritage were strongly in favor of the war effort, while those of French heritage, especially in [[Quebec]], showed far less interest. A series of political upheavals ensued, especially the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]. Simultaneously, the role of immigrants as loyal Canadians was contested, with large numbers of men of [[German Canadian|German]] or [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] heritage temporarily stripped of voting rights or incarcerated in camps. The war helped define separate political identities for the two groups, and permanently alienated Quebec and the Conservative Party.<ref>J. L. Granatstein, ''Broken promises: A history of conscription in Canada'' (1977)</ref>\n\nDuring this period, World War I helped to establish a separate Canadian identity among Anglophoners, especially through the military experiences of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] and the intense homefront debates on patriotism.<ref>Mackenzie (2005)</ref> (A [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|similar crisis]], though much less intense, erupted in World War II.)\n\nIn the 1920s, the Dominion of Canada achieved greater independence from Britain, notably in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931. It remained part of the larger [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] but played an independent role in the [[League of Nations]]. As Canada became increasingly independent and [[sovereignty|sovereign]], its primary foreign relationship and point of reference gradually moved to the United States, the superpower with whom it shared a long border and major economic, social and cultural relationships.\n\n[[File:Join the Team RCAF.jpg|thumb|upright| Join the Team! ([[Royal Canadian Air Force]]) - used from 1939 till 1945.]]\nThe Statute of Westminster also gave Canada [[Monarchy of Canada|its own monarchy]], which remains in [[personal union]] with [[Commonwealth realm|15 other countries]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. However, overt associations with British nationalism wound down after the end of the [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Second World War]], when Canada established its own citizenship laws in 1947. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a number of symbols of the Crown were either removed completely (such as the [[Royal Mail]]) or changed (such as the [[Royal Arms of Canada]]).\n\nIn the 1960s, Quebec experienced the [[Quiet Revolution]] to modernize society from traditional Christian teachings. [[French-Canadian|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] nationalists demanded independence, and tensions rose until violence erupted during the 1970 [[October Crisis]]. In 1976 the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] was elected to power in Quebec, with a nationalist vision that included securing French linguistic rights in the province and the pursuit of some form of sovereignty for Quebec, leading to a referendum in 1980 in Quebec on the question of [[sovereignty-association]], which was turned down by 59% of the voters. At the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982, the Quebec premier did not sign it; this led to two unsuccessful attempts to modify the constitution so it would be signed, and another referendum on Quebec independence in 1995 which was turned down by a small majority of 50.6%.\n\nIn 1965 Canada adopted the [[flag of Canada|maple leaf flag]], after considerable debate and misgivings on the part of a large number of [[English Canadian]]s. Two years later the country celebrated the centennial of Confederation, with an [[Expo '67|international exposition]] in Montreal.\n\nLegislative restrictions on immigration that had favoured British and other European immigrants were removed in the 1960s. By the 1970s immigrants increasingly came from [[Indo-Canadian|India]], [[Chinese Canadian|Hong Kong]], the [[African Canadian|Caribbean]] and [[Vietnamese Canadian|Vietnam]]. Post-war immigrants of all backgrounds tended to settle in the major urban centres, particularly [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]].\n\nDuring his long tenure in the office (1968\u201379, 1980\u201384), Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] made social and cultural change his political goal for Canada, including the pursuit of an official policy on [[bilingualism]] and plans for significant constitutional change. The west, particularly the oil and gas-producing province of [[Alberta]], opposed many of the policies emanating from central Canada, with the [[National Energy Program]] creating considerable antagonism and growing western alienation.\n\n===Modern times===\nAs for the role of history in national identity, the books of [[Pierre Berton]] and television series like ''[[Canada: A People's History]]'' have done much to spark the popular interest of Canadians in their history. Some commentators, such as Cohen, criticize the overall lack of attention paid by Canadians to their own history, noting a disturbing trend to ignore the broad history in favour of narrow focus on specific regions or groups.\n{{quote|It isn't just the schools, the museums and the government that fail us. It is also the professional historians, their books and periodicals. As J.L. Granatstein and Michael Bliss have argued, academic historians in Canada have stopped writing political and national history. They prefer to write labour history, women's history, ethnic history, and regional history, among others, often freighted with a sense of grievance or victimhood. This kind of history has its place, of course, but our history has become so specialized, so segmented, and so narrow that we are missing the national story in a country that has one and needs to hear it.<ref>Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian'', p. 84</ref>}}\n\nMuch of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values. To the political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], Canada should be conceived as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, one that contains many other kinds of communities within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, civic (the provincial and municipal governments) and civil associational sorts, but also national communities. Blattberg thus sees Canada as a multinational country and so asserts that it contains a number of nations within it. Aside from the various aboriginal First Nations, there is also the nation of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.<ref>Blattberg, ''Shall We Dance?

Prime Minister Pierre [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau's]] first legislative push was to implement the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism|Royal Commission on Bilingualism]] within the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official languages Act]] in 1969. Again, while this bilingualism is a notable feature to outsiders, the plan has been less than warmly embraced by many English Canadians some of whom resent the extra administrative costs and the requirement of many key federal public servants to be fluently bilingual.<ref>Sandford F. Borins. ''The Language of the Skies: The Bilingual Air Traffic Control Conflict in Canada'' (1983) p. 244</ref> Despite the widespread introduction of French-language classes throughout Canada, very few anglophones are truly bilingual outside of Quebec. Pierre Trudeau in regards to uniformity stated:\n\n{{Quotation |Uniformity is neither desirable nor possible in a country the size of Canada.

It was so ingrained.\"</ref>\n\n==French Canadians and identity in English Canada==\nThe Canadian philosopher and writer [[John Ralston Saul]] has expressed the view that the French fact in Canada is central to Canadian, and particularly to English Canadian identity:<blockquote>\nIt cannot be repeated enough that Quebec and, more precisely, francophone Canada is at the very heart of the Canadian mythology. I don't mean that it alone constitutes the heart, which is after all a complex place. But it is at the heart and no multiple set of bypass operations could rescue that mythology if Quebec were to leave. Separation is therefore a threat of death to anglophone Canada's whole sense of itself, of its self-respect, of its role as a constituent part of a nation, of the nature of the relationship between citizens.\"<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 293</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany Canadians believe that the relationship between the English and French languages is the central or defining aspect of the Canadian experience. Canada's [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Official Languages Commissioner]] (the federal government official charged with monitoring the two languages) has stated, \"[I]n the same way that race is at the core of what it means to be American and at the core of an American experience and class is at the core of British experience, I think that language is at the core of Canadian experience.\"<ref>Official Languages Commissioner [[Graham Fraser]] is quoted in the ''[[Hill Times]]'', August 31, 2009, p. 14.</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Canadians and Canadian identity==\n[[File:RK 0908 9604 Spirit of Haida Gwaii the Jade Canoe.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'', sculpture by [[Bill Reid]] in [[Vancouver Airport]].]]Saul argues that Canadian identity is founded not merely on the relationship built of French/English pragmatic compromises and cooperation but rests in fact on a triangular foundation which includes, significantly, Canada's aboriginal peoples.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' p. 88.</ref> From the reliance of French and later English explorers on Native knowledge of the country, to the development of the indigenous M\u00e9tis society on the Prairies which shaped what would become Canada, and the military response to their resistance to annexation by Canada,<ref>Saul ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'' at p. 91</ref> indigenous peoples were originally partners and players in laying the foundations of Canada.

The royal elite of (what is now) Ontario gained much more power in the aftermath and used that power to repel American ideas such as democracy and republicanism, especially in those areas of Ontario settled primarily by Americans.

In metropolitan areas such as [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]], there is often a strong sense that multiculturalism is a normal and respectable expression of being Canadian. Canada is also considered a mosaic because of the multi-culturalism.\n\nSupporters of Canadian multiculturalism will also argue that cultural appreciation of ethnic and religious diversity promotes a greater willingness to tolerate political differences, and multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. Richard Gwyn has suggested that \"tolerance\" has replaced \"loyalty\" as the touchstone of Canadian identity.<ref>Gwyn, ''The Man Who Made Us What We Are'', p. 365.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, critics of Canada's multiculturalism argue that the country's \"timid\" attitude towards the assimilation of immigrants has actually weakened, not strengthened Canada's national identity through factionalism. Columnist and author Richard Gwyn expresses concern that Canada's sense of self may become so weak that it might vanish altogether.<ref>Richard Gwyn, ''Nationalism Without Walls: The Unbearable Lightness of Being Canadian'', Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1996</ref> The indulgent attitude taken towards cultural differences is perhaps a side effect of the vexed histories of French-English and Aboriginal-settler relations, which have created a need for a civic national identity, as opposed to one based on some homogenous cultural ideal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} On the other hand, concerns have been raised of the danger that \"ethnic nationalism will trump civic nationalism\"<ref>Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian''p. 162</ref> and that Canada will leap \"from colony to post-national cosmopolitan\" without giving Canadians a fair chance of ever finding a centre of gravity or certain sense of Canadian identity.<ref>Cohen, ''The Unfinished Canadian'' pp. 163-164</ref><ref>See also: Resnick, quote: \"But let us not make diversity a substitute for broader aspects of national identity or turn multiculturalism into a shibboleth because we are unwilling to reaffirm underlying values that make Canada what it has become. And those values, I repeat again, are largely European in their derivation, on both the English-speaking and French\u2014speaking sides.\" at p. 64.</ref>\n\nFor John Ralston Saul, Canada's approach of not insisting on a single national mythology or identity is not necessarily a sign of the country's weakness, but rather its greatest success,<ref>Saul, p. 8.</ref> signalling a rejection of or evolution from the European mono-cultural concept of a national identity to something far more \"soft\" and less complex: <blockquote>The essential characteristic of the Canadian public mythology is its complexity. To the extent that it denies the illusion of simplicity, it is a reasonable facsimile of reality. That makes it a revolutionary reversal of the standard nation-state myth. To accept our reality\u2014the myth of complexity\u2014is to live out of sync with \u00e9lites in other countries, particularly those in the business and academic communities.<ref>Saul, ''Reflections of a Siamese Twin'', p. 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn January 2007, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] advised the creation of a new sub-ministerial cabinet portfolio with the title ''Canadian Identity'' for the first time in Canadian history, naming [[Jason Kenney]] to the position of [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity]].\n\n==The role of Canadian social policy and identity==\nIn ''Fire and Ice: The United States, Canada and the Myth of Converging Values'', the author, [[Michael Adams (author)|Michael Adams]], head of the [[Environics]] polling company seeks distinctions between Canadians and Americans using polling research performed by his company as evidence. Critics of the idea of a fundamentally \"liberal Canada\" such as [[David Frum]] argue that the Canadian drive towards a more noticeably leftist political stance is largely due to the increasing role that [[Quebec]] plays in the Canadian government (three of the last five elected Prime Ministers have been [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecers]], four if one includes Ontarian-born Paul Martin). Quebec historically was the most conservative, religious and traditional part of Canada. Since the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, however, it has become the most secular and [[social democratic]] region of Canada. However, it is noteworthy that many Western provinces (particularly [[Saskatchewan]] and [[British Columbia]]) also have reputations as supporting leftist and social democratic policies. For example, Saskatchewan is one of the few provinces (all in the West) to reelect social democratic governments and is the cradle of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] and its successor the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]. Much of the energy of the early Canadian feminist movement occurred in [[Manitoba]].\n\nBy contrast, the Conservative provincial government of Alberta has frequently quarrelled with federal administrations perceived to be dominated by \"eastern liberal elites.\"<ref>Panizza 2005</ref> Part of this is due to what Albertans feel were federal intrusions on provincial jurisdictions such as the [[National Energy Program]] and other attempts to 'interfere' with Albertan oil resources.\n\n==Distinctly Canadian==\n[[File:Winnipeg snowstorm aftermath.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Canada is noted for cold and snow.]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2019}}<!--quite a few dubious quotes have been here, please add citations: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_identity&type=revision&diff=727585148&oldid=727317052 -->\n*The search for the Canadian identity often shows some whimsical results.

Georgians like to say that the tamada is dictator of the table, but it would be more appropriate to compare him to a leader or even a teacher. Tamada traditionally ought to be eloquent, intelligent, smart, sharp\u2212witted and quick\u2212thinking, with a good sense of humor since very often some of the guests might try to compete with him on the toast making. At the Georgian table, a tamada is considered to help bridge the gap between past, present and future, toasting ancestors and descendants as well as the other guests at the table. A toast can be proposed only by a tamada; the rest are to develop the idea. Some toasts take a traditional form; for example, for some toasts all men have to stand up and drink wine in silence. In many cases, however, the guests vie to say something more original and emotional than the previous speaker, and the whole process grows into a sort of oratory contest.\n\nHistorically the tamada had more control over the table than he does today. For example, members of the supra were supposed to ask permission before leaving the table and the party. If they got the permission they could be toasted by the tamada and other members before leaving. If the first toast is to the tamada, it is proposed by someone else, generally by the host, who proposes the nomination of the tamada.\n\n==Choosing a tamada==\n[[File:Toast master earliest wine Georgia 2007.jpg|220 px|thumb|Bronze statue from the 7th century BC discovered during archaeological excavations in the city of [[Vani]]. This statue is the statue of a Tamada, a toastmaster. The sheet also pictures amphora that were used at this time to carry and to stock the wine. Stamp of Georgia, 2007.]]\n\nIf the supra is very small, in someone's home with only a few guests, the role of tamada won't be specially assigned, but rather simply assumed by the head of the household. At very large occasions, such as wedding or funeral banquets, the tamada is chosen in advance by the family, who ask a relative or friend who is known to be a good tamada to lead the supra. At mid-size occasions, however, the people of the table themselves choose the tamada.\n\nThe choice depends on several factors. There may be a senior person at the table to whom the role naturally falls. In some groups there will be one man who regularly is the tamada because he enjoys it and is good at it. Sometimes groups of friends who gather frequently will rotate the responsibility of being tamada. In many cases, when it comes time to choose, one person \u2013 often the oldest member of the table \u2013 will propose a candidate for tamada by saying something like, \u201cKote should be our tamada, shouldn't he?\u201d. Others express agreement and, if Kote raises no serious objections, the person who first suggested the choice raises his glass and proposes the first toast to the tamada \u2013 \u201cKotes Gaumarjos\u201d (to Kote). The supra participants do the same. The newly toasted tamada initiates new toasts from then on.\n\nIt might be the case, however, that Kote doesn't want to be tamada. Perhaps he feels that the senior person is suggesting his name ought to be the tamada. Maybe he was tamada last night and has a hangover, or is driving and can't drink, or would like to leave the gathering early, or just doesn't like to be tamada. He would refuse the job, perhaps pleading some excuse. Then the people at the table propose someone else as tamada, who may be willing to take up tamada\u2212hood and may not be, and so on, until someone at the table agrees to be tamada, and the first toast is drunk to him.\n\nIf the tamada has been chosen in advance by the family, the senior member of the family will initiate the drinking by proposing the first toast to the tamada directly, without any preceding discussion. Following the proposal of this first toast, each member of the [[Supra (feast)|supra]] toasts the tamada with a fixed phrase or two and drinks his glass. On this toast people drink quite quickly, almost in unison, and without any verbal elaboration on the theme of the toast. Some frequently heard phrases on this first toast include \u201cKotes Gaumarjos\u201d (to Kote), where Kote is the name of the person who will be tamada, or \u201cKargad chaatarebinos es supra\u201d (\"May he lead this supra well\u201d, or \u201cMay he cause us to have a good time\u201d).\n\nThere is only one common circumstance where the first toast is not to the tamada, and that concerns usually small, less formal supras where the host himself is tamada. In that case, the host simply assumes the role, as noted above, and proposes the first toast to a particular theme (discussed below).\n\n==Qualities of a good tamada==\n[[File:Pirosmani kutezh.jpg|thumb|250px|''Begos' friends'' by [[Niko Pirosmani]]. A tamada holding a ''[[kantsi (horn)|kantsi]]'' (horn) and introducing a toast at a ''[[keipi]]'' (festive supra)]]\nA good tamada is selected for his possession of a number of special qualities. First of all, a good tamada is one who is good with words, who speaks clearly and cleverly, who can say in an original way things which are heard over and over again at every supra. The best tamadas are extemporaneously poets.\n\nSecondly, a good tamada must be able to organize well, as he is almost entirely in charge of the entertainment. He has to decide which toasts to drink when, and how often to propose new toasts, so that a good rhythm is established. He has to orchestrate singing or dancing, if there is such, between stretches of toasting, so people stay attentive and entertained. This relates closely to a third quality of a good tamada: sensitivity. The tamada should have a good feel for the mood of the table and try to maintain a pleasant upbeat atmosphere in which all members are participating. The table should have a kind of unity, said one Georgian, which is the responsibility of the tamada. He should notice if certain members begin to pay less attention and draw them back, perhaps with a special toast or by making them \u201calaverdi\u201d.\n\nHe should be able to sense how much people have drunk, and increase or decrease the pace of the toasting as needed. (In general, the pace of toasting is faster earlier in the evening and slows down once everyone reaches a certain level of inebriation.) Part of this includes recognizing when the guests are at the proper level of inebriation for him to propose more abstract or emotional toasts. If the tamada knows the people at the supra well, he will be able to tailor his toasts to the guests, encouraging them to have a good time.\n\nFourthly, a good tamada has to be somewhat forceful in order to get people to pay attention to the toasting and to get everyone to drink each toast.

Georgians like to say that the tamada is dictator of the table, but it would be more appropriate to compare him to a leader or even a teacher. Tamada traditionally ought to be eloquent, intelligent, smart, sharp\u2212witted and quick\u2212thinking, with a good sense of humor since very often some of the guests might try to compete with him on the toast making. At the Georgian table, a tamada is considered to help bridge the gap between past, present and future, toasting ancestors and descendants as well as the other guests at the table. A toast can be proposed only by a tamada; the rest are to develop the idea. Some toasts take a traditional form; for example, for some toasts all men have to stand up and drink wine in silence. In many cases, however, the guests vie to say something more original and emotional than the previous speaker, and the whole process grows into a sort of oratory contest.\n\nHistorically the tamada had more control over the table than he does today. For example, members of the supra were supposed to ask permission before leaving the table and the party. If they got the permission they could be toasted by the tamada and other members before leaving. If the first toast is to the tamada, it is proposed by someone else, generally by the host, who proposes the nomination of the tamada.\n\n==Choosing a tamada==\n[[File:Toast master earliest wine Georgia 2007.jpg|220 px|thumb|Bronze statue from the 7th century BC discovered during archaeological excavations in the city of [[Vani]]. This statue is the statue of a Tamada, a toastmaster. The sheet also pictures amphora that were used at this time to carry and to stock the wine. Stamp of Georgia, 2007.]]\n\nIf the supra is very small, in someone's home with only a few guests, the role of tamada won't be specially assigned, but rather simply assumed by the head of the household. At very large occasions, such as wedding or funeral banquets, the tamada is chosen in advance by the family, who ask a relative or friend who is known to be a good tamada to lead the supra. At mid-size occasions, however, the people of the table themselves choose the tamada.\n\nThe choice depends on several factors. There may be a senior person at the table to whom the role naturally falls. In some groups there will be one man who regularly is the tamada because he enjoys it and is good at it. Sometimes groups of friends who gather frequently will rotate the responsibility of being tamada. In many cases, when it comes time to choose, one person \u2013 often the oldest member of the table \u2013 will propose a candidate for tamada by saying something like, \u201cKote should be our tamada, shouldn't he?\u201d. Others express agreement and, if Kote raises no serious objections, the person who first suggested the choice raises his glass and proposes the first toast to the tamada \u2013 \u201cKotes Gaumarjos\u201d (to Kote). The supra participants do the same. The newly toasted tamada initiates new toasts from then on.\n\nIt might be the case, however, that Kote doesn't want to be tamada. Perhaps he feels that the senior person is suggesting his name ought to be the tamada. Maybe he was tamada last night and has a hangover, or is driving and can't drink, or would like to leave the gathering early, or just doesn't like to be tamada. He would refuse the job, perhaps pleading some excuse. Then the people at the table propose someone else as tamada, who may be willing to take up tamada\u2212hood and may not be, and so on, until someone at the table agrees to be tamada, and the first toast is drunk to him.\n\nIf the tamada has been chosen in advance by the family, the senior member of the family will initiate the drinking by proposing the first toast to the tamada directly, without any preceding discussion. Following the proposal of this first toast, each member of the [[Supra (feast)|supra]] toasts the tamada with a fixed phrase or two and drinks his glass. On this toast people drink quite quickly, almost in unison, and without any verbal elaboration on the theme of the toast. Some frequently heard phrases on this first toast include \u201cKotes Gaumarjos\u201d (to Kote), where Kote is the name of the person who will be tamada, or \u201cKargad chaatarebinos es supra\u201d (\"May he lead this supra well\u201d, or \u201cMay he cause us to have a good time\u201d).\n\nThere is only one common circumstance where the first toast is not to the tamada, and that concerns usually small, less formal supras where the host himself is tamada. In that case, the host simply assumes the role, as noted above, and proposes the first toast to a particular theme (discussed below).\n\n==Qualities of a good tamada==\n[[File:Pirosmani kutezh.jpg|thumb|250px|''Begos' friends'' by [[Niko Pirosmani]]. A tamada holding a ''[[kantsi (horn)|kantsi]]'' (horn) and introducing a toast at a ''[[keipi]]'' (festive supra)]]\nA good tamada is selected for his possession of a number of special qualities. First of all, a good tamada is one who is good with words, who speaks clearly and cleverly, who can say in an original way things which are heard over and over again at every supra. The best tamadas are extemporaneously poets.\n\nSecondly, a good tamada must be able to organize well, as he is almost entirely in charge of the entertainment. He has to decide which toasts to drink when, and how often to propose new toasts, so that a good rhythm is established. He has to orchestrate singing or dancing, if there is such, between stretches of toasting, so people stay attentive and entertained. This relates closely to a third quality of a good tamada: sensitivity. The tamada should have a good feel for the mood of the table and try to maintain a pleasant upbeat atmosphere in which all members are participating. The table should have a kind of unity, said one Georgian, which is the responsibility of the tamada. He should notice if certain members begin to pay less attention and draw them back, perhaps with a special toast or by making them \u201calaverdi\u201d.\n\nHe should be able to sense how much people have drunk, and increase or decrease the pace of the toasting as needed. (In general, the pace of toasting is faster earlier in the evening and slows down once everyone reaches a certain level of inebriation.) Part of this includes recognizing when the guests are at the proper level of inebriation for him to propose more abstract or emotional toasts. If the tamada knows the people at the supra well, he will be able to tailor his toasts to the guests, encouraging them to have a good time.\n\nFourthly, a good tamada has to be somewhat forceful in order to get people to pay attention to the toasting and to get everyone to drink each toast. This gets harder as the evening wears on and some people would rather talk than toast. Last, but not at all least, a good tamada must also be a good drinker; the tamada is expected to empty his glass on each toast, but it is considered disgraceful for him to actually get drunk.\n\nBoth the tamada and the other guests are expected to propose a toast to every person at the Georgian table. Every speaker tries to distinguish the most interesting, original and praiseworthy features of a person toasted. The Georgians do not consider this flattery, but a way to encourage the good traits. They believe when a person is told that he is kind and honest he will find it difficult to do evil; when he is told he is generous he will try not to be greedy.\n\n== References ==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n* Igor de Garine, Valerie de Garine (2001), ''Drinking: Anthropological Approaches''.

It is also the first Warner Bros short to credit [[Milt Franklyn]] as a musical director.\n\n== Plot ==\nBugs comes out of his hole in a city park, reading the newspaper on his way to his bank, to make a withdrawal from his personal depository of carrots. On the way, he reads that \"Rabbit Season Opens Today\" and says how glad he is that he lives in a 'safe' urban environment, away from guns going off in the country (he miraculously avoids heavy traffic while crossing the street, his face buried in the newspaper).\n\nLeaving the bank, Bugs flags down what he thinks is a taxi, but which is actually Mugsy pulling up to let Rocky out to rob the bank. As Bugs settles back for \"a couple of times around the park\", Rocky returns amidst a shootout with bank security. Rocky leaps into the car and orders Mugsy to take off.  Bugs emerges from beneath the many giant bags of cash and complains that he does not mind sharing the ride but is not too keen on \"all this laundry\". Rocky pulls his gun and asks Bugs, \"How much do you know, rabbit?\" Bugs does not realize he is in the same vehicle as a robber who is asking him what he knows ''about the hold-up'', and says \"Who, me? Oh, I know lots of things. Like two and two is four, [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] is de capital of [[Nevada]], uh, [[George Washington]] was de foist President.\" Rocky responds, \"Cut it. Dis guy knows too much, Mugsy. We'll take him for a ride.\" Bugs, now dressed in vintage driving clothes, joins Rocky on the back seat and rattles on about how much he likes taking rides. Rocky points his gun at him and tells him to \"shaddap\". Bugs talks non-stop about how he is not one to keep talking after being told to shut up, so Rocky tells him to \"shaddap shaddin' up\".\n\nBugs asks Mugsy to stop at a \"nice, clean gas station\". Bugs gets out of the car and, after simply asking for and receiving a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] from the easily fooled Mugsy, he uses a pay phone to call the police to report the bank robbers, \"Hello, Police Department? I've got the bank robbers. We're on Highway 55, headed west. We're driving a '52 [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] - [[Straight-eight engine|straight 8]] - [[overhead valve]]s - with [[California]] license plates!\" Having figured out Bugs' ploy, Mugsy removes Bugs from the phone booth. The last part of Bugs' conversation with the police is delivered in increasingly louder shouts as he is pulled, along with the listening portion of the phone, back to the car.  As the car takes off, the policeman on the other end is yanked out through the phone and bounced along the road some distance behind, until the wire snaps.  With his thick Irish accent, he says,\"Operator \u2013 we've been disconnected... ah-h-h\".\n\nSoon, Rocky and Mugsy's car stops in front of a railroad [[grade crossing]] protected by a swinging [[Wigwag (railroad)|\"wigwag\"]] signal warning of an approaching train. Rocky tells Bugs to get out and let them know if the coast is clear; for a second, Bugs morphs into Mugsy's profile and voice to tell Rocky, \"Okay, boss!\"  He checks the tracks, then calls back, \"Okay, all clear.\" The robbers proceed and a speeding train crashes into them.\n\nBugs is forced to fix the car at gunpoint. Rocky orders Mugsy to button his lip when Mugsy repeats something that Rocky has said to Bugs.  Mugsy literally buttons his lip. Bugs repairs everything, but they are missing one tire, so Bugs tells them that he is afraid that they are stuck.\n\nRocky says that Bugs is the only one stuck and makes Bugs act as the tire, by running alongside the car while holding the right front axle (Rocky tells Mugsy to take the \"scenic route\"). Soon, they arrive at their hideout, which is perched on a cliff. Once inside, Rocky instructs Mugsy to take Bugs \"inta the udder room and let 'im have it\".  Once there, Bugs easily convinces him that Rocky meant for him to let Bugs have the gun by saying, \"Okay Mugsy, let me have it. Come, come, you hoid what the boss said: 'Let me have it'!\" When Mugsy relents, he gets shot by Bugs (off-screen), stumbles back into the front room and tells Rocky \"I let 'im have it, boss, just like you said. Ooohhhhh,\" and passes out on top of Rocky, who quickly punches him off.\n\nRocky heads for the room to take care of Bugs himself. As the robber turns the doorknob, Bugs imitates both a police siren and the voice of an officer arriving and ordering other policemen to surround the house.  Bugs tears out of the room, seemingly panicked about the cops showing up. Rocky is running around in the main room, desperate to find a hiding place. Bugs hides the robbers in the stove, then pretends to be the police pounding on the front door. Then, he pulls off acting as both the policeman with an Irish accent ''and'' himself trying to hide Rocky and Mugsy. While \"interrogating\" himself, Bugs denies hiding them in the stove, turning on the gas heat of the stove and throwing a lighted match inside to prove his innocence. The stove explodes, and the \"policeman\", convinced, leaves. Rocky and Mugsy crawl out of the stove, somewhat scorched and dazed. Not even five seconds after emerging, the ''real'' policemen come and, in an almost exact match of Bugs' previous ruse, one of them (with an Irish accent) asks where Rocky and Mugsy are. When Bugs is about to throw another lighted match into the stove, Rocky and Mugsy quickly run out of the stove and piteously ''beg'' the policeman to arrest them.\n\nThe next day, Bugs becomes a criminal-catching detective talking on the phone, as a member of ''Detectives Guild: Local 839'' (a pun on the [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839|cartoonists' union]]), styling himself as \"Bugs Bunny, [[Private investigator|private eyeball]] \u2013 thugs thwarted, [[arson]]ists arrested, [[Banditry|bandits]] booked, [[counterfeit]]ers caught, [[Forgery|forgers]] found and chiselers [[chisel]]ed.\"\n\n''Bugs and Thugs'' is available on the following DVDs:\n\n* ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]''\n* ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3]]''\n* ''Looney Tunes Centerstage: Volume 2''\n\n==Cast==\n\u2022 [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Rocky and Mugsy|Rocky, Mugsy]] and police officers\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0046811}}\n* {{bcdb title|3769}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box \n| before= [[Captain Hareblower]] \n| title= [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny Cartoons]] \n| years= 1954 \n| after= [[No Parking Hare]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Friz Freleng |state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:1954 films]]\n[[Category:1954 animated films]]\n[[Category:1954 short films]]\n[[Category:1950s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1950s animated short films]]\n[[Category:1950s heist films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes shorts]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Milt Franklyn]]\n[[Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Edward G.

Cartoons |date=1989 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co |isbn=0-8050-0894-2 |page=259}}</ref> The film is a semi-remake of ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]'' and was directed by [[Friz Freleng]]. It is also the first Warner Bros short to credit [[Milt Franklyn]] as a musical director.\n\n== Plot ==\nBugs comes out of his hole in a city park, reading the newspaper on his way to his bank, to make a withdrawal from his personal depository of carrots. On the way, he reads that \"Rabbit Season Opens Today\" and says how glad he is that he lives in a 'safe' urban environment, away from guns going off in the country (he miraculously avoids heavy traffic while crossing the street, his face buried in the newspaper).\n\nLeaving the bank, Bugs flags down what he thinks is a taxi, but which is actually Mugsy pulling up to let Rocky out to rob the bank. As Bugs settles back for \"a couple of times around the park\", Rocky returns amidst a shootout with bank security. Rocky leaps into the car and orders Mugsy to take off.  Bugs emerges from beneath the many giant bags of cash and complains that he does not mind sharing the ride but is not too keen on \"all this laundry\". Rocky pulls his gun and asks Bugs, \"How much do you know, rabbit?\" Bugs does not realize he is in the same vehicle as a robber who is asking him what he knows ''about the hold-up'', and says \"Who, me? Oh, I know lots of things. Like two and two is four, [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] is de capital of [[Nevada]], uh, [[George Washington]] was de foist President.\" Rocky responds, \"Cut it. Dis guy knows too much, Mugsy. We'll take him for a ride.\" Bugs, now dressed in vintage driving clothes, joins Rocky on the back seat and rattles on about how much he likes taking rides. Rocky points his gun at him and tells him to \"shaddap\". Bugs talks non-stop about how he is not one to keep talking after being told to shut up, so Rocky tells him to \"shaddap shaddin' up\".\n\nBugs asks Mugsy to stop at a \"nice, clean gas station\". Bugs gets out of the car and, after simply asking for and receiving a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] from the easily fooled Mugsy, he uses a pay phone to call the police to report the bank robbers, \"Hello, Police Department? I've got the bank robbers. We're on Highway 55, headed west. We're driving a '52 [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] - [[Straight-eight engine|straight 8]] - [[overhead valve]]s - with [[California]] license plates!\" Having figured out Bugs' ploy, Mugsy removes Bugs from the phone booth. The last part of Bugs' conversation with the police is delivered in increasingly louder shouts as he is pulled, along with the listening portion of the phone, back to the car.  As the car takes off, the policeman on the other end is yanked out through the phone and bounced along the road some distance behind, until the wire snaps.  With his thick Irish accent, he says,\"Operator \u2013 we've been disconnected... ah-h-h\".\n\nSoon, Rocky and Mugsy's car stops in front of a railroad [[grade crossing]] protected by a swinging [[Wigwag (railroad)|\"wigwag\"]] signal warning of an approaching train. Rocky tells Bugs to get out and let them know if the coast is clear; for a second, Bugs morphs into Mugsy's profile and voice to tell Rocky, \"Okay, boss!\"  He checks the tracks, then calls back, \"Okay, all clear.\" The robbers proceed and a speeding train crashes into them.\n\nBugs is forced to fix the car at gunpoint. Rocky orders Mugsy to button his lip when Mugsy repeats something that Rocky has said to Bugs.  Mugsy literally buttons his lip. Bugs repairs everything, but they are missing one tire, so Bugs tells them that he is afraid that they are stuck.\n\nRocky says that Bugs is the only one stuck and makes Bugs act as the tire, by running alongside the car while holding the right front axle (Rocky tells Mugsy to take the \"scenic route\"). Soon, they arrive at their hideout, which is perched on a cliff. Once inside, Rocky instructs Mugsy to take Bugs \"inta the udder room and let 'im have it\".  Once there, Bugs easily convinces him that Rocky meant for him to let Bugs have the gun by saying, \"Okay Mugsy, let me have it. Come, come, you hoid what the boss said: 'Let me have it'!\" When Mugsy relents, he gets shot by Bugs (off-screen), stumbles back into the front room and tells Rocky \"I let 'im have it, boss, just like you said. Ooohhhhh,\" and passes out on top of Rocky, who quickly punches him off.\n\nRocky heads for the room to take care of Bugs himself. As the robber turns the doorknob, Bugs imitates both a police siren and the voice of an officer arriving and ordering other policemen to surround the house.  Bugs tears out of the room, seemingly panicked about the cops showing up. Rocky is running around in the main room, desperate to find a hiding place. Bugs hides the robbers in the stove, then pretends to be the police pounding on the front door. Then, he pulls off acting as both the policeman with an Irish accent ''and'' himself trying to hide Rocky and Mugsy. While \"interrogating\" himself, Bugs denies hiding them in the stove, turning on the gas heat of the stove and throwing a lighted match inside to prove his innocence. The stove explodes, and the \"policeman\", convinced, leaves. Rocky and Mugsy crawl out of the stove, somewhat scorched and dazed. Not even five seconds after emerging, the ''real'' policemen come and, in an almost exact match of Bugs' previous ruse, one of them (with an Irish accent) asks where Rocky and Mugsy are. When Bugs is about to throw another lighted match into the stove, Rocky and Mugsy quickly run out of the stove and piteously ''beg'' the policeman to arrest them.\n\nThe next day, Bugs becomes a criminal-catching detective talking on the phone, as a member of ''Detectives Guild: Local 839'' (a pun on the [[The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839|cartoonists' union]]), styling himself as \"Bugs Bunny, [[Private investigator|private eyeball]] \u2013 thugs thwarted, [[arson]]ists arrested, [[Banditry|bandits]] booked, [[counterfeit]]ers caught, [[Forgery|forgers]] found and chiselers [[chisel]]ed.\"\n\n''Bugs and Thugs'' is available on the following DVDs:\n\n* ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]''\n* ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3]]''\n* ''Looney Tunes Centerstage: Volume 2''\n\n==Cast==\n\u2022 [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Rocky and Mugsy|Rocky, Mugsy]] and police officers\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons]]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0046811}}\n* {{bcdb title|3769}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box \n| before= [[Captain Hareblower]] \n| title= [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny Cartoons]] \n| years= 1954 \n| after= [[No Parking Hare]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Friz Freleng |state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:1954 films]]\n[[Category:1954 animated films]]\n[[Category:1954 short films]]\n[[Category:1950s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1950s animated short films]]\n[[Category:1950s heist films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes shorts]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Milt Franklyn]]\n[[Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Edward G.
