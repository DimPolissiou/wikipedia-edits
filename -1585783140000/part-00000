The economy was widely based on specialty agriculture, oil, tourism, shipping, film, and after 1940 advanced technology such as aerospace and electronics industries \u2013 along with a significant military presence. The films and stars of [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] helped make the state the \"center\" of worldwide attention. California became an American cultural phenomenon; the idea of the \"California Dream\" as a portion of the larger [[American Dream]] of finding a better life drew 35 million new residents from the start to the end of the 20th century (1900\u20132010).<ref>{{cite book| author=Walter Nugent| title=Into the West: The Story of Its People| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AvI-biS6EsC&pg=PA5| year=2001| publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.| page=5| isbn=9780307426420}}</ref> [[Silicon Valley]] became the world's center for computer innovation.\n\n==California demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 8000\n|1850= 120000\n|1860= 379994\n|1870= 560247\n|1880= 864694\n|1890= 1213398\n|1900= 1485053\n|1910= 2377549\n|1920= 3426861\n|1930= 5677251\n|1940= 6907387\n|1950= 10586223\n|1960= 15717204\n|1970= 19953134\n|1980= 23667902\n|1990= 29760021\n|2000= 33871648\n|2010= 37253956\n|2020 (projection)= 45.0 million\n|footnote= Sources: 1850\u20132010 U.S. Census<ref>[http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php Resident Population Data \u2013 2010 Census<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101090833/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |date=2011-01-01 }}</ref><br />* The 1850 statistics are corrected for lost<br />census data in San Francisco, Santa Clara<br />and Contra Costa Counties.<br />California Indians were not counted<br />before the 1870 census.\n}}\n\nCalifornia is now the most populous state in the United States. If it were an independent country, California would rank 34th in population in the world. California has had waves of immigration and emigration over the years. The first big wave was the [[California Gold Rush]] starting in 1848 of miners, businessmen, farmers, loggers, etc. as well as their many supporters.\n\nThere were fewer than 10,000 females in a total California population (not including [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who were not counted) of about 120,000 residents in 1850. About 3.0% of the gold rush Argonauts before 1850 were female or about 3,500 [[Women in the California Gold Rush|female Gold Rushers]], compared to about 115,000 male California Gold Rushers. Massive immigration from mostly other states continued throughout the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"dhs.gov\">U.S. Immigration Statistics yearbook; pg. 5 [https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2011/ois_yb_2011.pdf] accessed 11 Jan 2014</ref><ref>\"Historical Statistics of the United States, 1789\u20131945\"; [https://web.archive.org/web/20041229215830/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html] Accessed 14 Apr 2011</ref> California did not reach a \"normal\" male to female ratio of about one to one until the 1950 census. California for over a century was short on females.\n\nThe 1900 census showed emigrations down to \"only\" a 20% growth rate. The early 1900s showed a massive population increase of over 60% between 1900 and 1910. The population more than doubled again in the next 20 years by 1930. Foreign immigration largely ceased during the [[Great Depression]], as immigration to the United States was held to a low of 23,068 per year by 1933, and many foreign workers were deported. There were not enough jobs to go around. After [[World War II]] and the [[Great Depression]], there was a rapidly increasing buildup of United States workers in California as wartime industries boomed. Most of these workers were from other states as they settled in California and increased the California population to 10,586,223 by 1950. Immigration to the United States only started to increase significantly in 1946, when immigration to all of the United States was back up to 108,721 per year<ref name=\"dhs.gov\"/> The continuing prosperity and emigration from other states and immigration from other countries in the 1950s and 1970s almost doubled the California population again to 19,953,134 by 1970. The 1970\u20132010 population growth has still been substantial but has slowed to \"only\" about a 15% growth rate per decade. By 2010 the California population growth rate slowed slightly to 10%.\n\n==California earthquakes==\n{{See also|List of earthquakes in California}}\n\n[[Earthquake]]s in California are common occurrences since the state is traversed by six major [[strike-slip fault]] systems with hundreds of related faults, many of which are \"sister faults\" of the infamous [[San Andreas Fault]] that runs nearly the full length of California at the juncture of the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]]. The fault systems include the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], [[Calaveras Fault]], [[Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault]], and the [[San Gregorio Fault]]. Significant blind [[thrust fault]]s (faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures) are associated with portions of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] and the northern reaches of the [[Diablo Range]] and [[Mount Diablo]]. The [[California earthquake forecast]] gives a rough estimate of where the main earthquake zones in California are. Earthquake damage depends on what area is hit, how close to the surface the center of the earthquake is located, and its magnitude. Earthquake damage, for a given magnitude earthquake, to human structures depends on how well the buildings are built and what the structures are located on. Buildings on soft or filled-in soil suffer the most because they feel shock waves most strongly. Buildings on bedrock suffer less damage because the ground is firmer. Sometimes the ensuing fires, floods or [[tsunami]]s caused by the earthquake are often where the greatest damage occurs.\n\n[[File:Sfearthquake2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Stockton Street (San Francisco)|Stockton Street]] from [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], looking toward [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]]]]\n[[File:San Francisco Fire Sacramento Street 1906-04-18.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Arnold Genthe's [[Looking Down Sacramento Street, San Francisco, April 18, 1906|famous photograph]], looking toward the fire on Sacramento Street]]\n[[File:1906 Boatwright intensity.jpg|thumb|250px|The intensity of the earthquake]]\n\nThe '''[[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]''' struck the city (then the largest in California) and nearby communities at 5:12&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, April 18, 1906.<ref name=usgs>[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1906/18april/index.php USGS \u2013 The Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake]</ref> Devastating fires broke out in the city that lasted for several days, destroying about 28,000 buildings.

Organized businessmen were the leaders of both of these reforms. The driving force for railroad regulation came less from an outraged public seeking lower rates than from shippers and merchants who wanted to stabilize their businesses. Public utility officers spearheaded campaigns for the passage, and later the enlargement of the Public Utilities Act. They expected that state regulation would reduce wasteful competition between their companies, improve the value of their companies' securities, and allow them to escape continual wrangling with county and municipal authorities.<ref name=\"in JSTOR\">Mansel G.

Bard's election in 1899 as United States senator enabled the anti-[[political machine|machine]] Republicans to sustain a continuing opposition to the [[Southern Pacific Railway]]'s political power in California. They helped nominate [[George C. Pardee]] for governor in 1902 and formed the \"[[Lincoln\u2013Roosevelt League]]\". In 1910 [[Hiram W. Johnson]] won the campaign for governor under the slogan \"Kick the Southern Pacific out of politics.\" In 1912 Johnson became the running mate for [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on the new [[Bull Moose Party]] ticket.<ref>W. H. Hutchinson, \"Prologue to Reform: the California Anti-Railroad Republicans, 1899\u20131905\".

Los Angeles (population 102,000 in 1900) focused on the dangers posed by the Southern Pacific Railroad, the liquor trade, and labor unions; San Francisco (population 342,000 in 1900) was confronted with a corrupt union-backed political \"machine\" that was finally overthrown following the earthquake of 1906. Smaller cities like [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (which had a population of 22,000 in 1900) had somewhat different concerns, such as fruit [[cooperative]]s, [[urban development]], rival rural economies, and [[Asian American|Asian]] labor.<ref>Timothy J.

Lyons, \"Hollywood and World War I, 1914\u20131918.\" ''Journal of Popular Film'' 1.1 (1972): 15-30.</ref> Attractive climate conditions led to the addition of numerous Army and Navy training camps and airfields. Construction of transports and warships boosted the economy of the Bay area.\n\n==Organized labor==\nOrganized labor was centered in San Francisco for much of the state's early history. By the opening decades of the twentieth century, labor efforts had expanded to Los Angeles, Long Beach and the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. In 1901, the San Francisco-based [[City Front Federation]] was reputed to be the strongest trade federation in the country. It grew out of intense organizational drives in every trade during the boom around the start of the 20th century.\n\nEmployers also organized during the building trades strike of 1900 and the (San Francisco) City Front Federation strike of 1901, which led to the founding of the [[Building Trades Council]]. The [[open shop]] question was at stake. Out of the City Front strike came the [[Union Labor Party (California)|Union Labor Party]], because workers were angry at the mayor for using the [[San Francisco Police Department|police]] to protect strikebreakers. [[Eugene Schmitz]] was elected mayor in 1902 on the party's ticket, making San Francisco the only town in the United States, for a time, to be run by labor. A combination of [[political corruption|corruption]] and unscrupulous reformers culminated in [[graft (politics)|graft]] prosecutions in 1907.\n\nIn 1910, Los Angeles was still an open shop, and employers in the north threatened for a new push to open San Francisco shops. Responding, labor sent delegations south in June 1910. National organizers were sent in during a [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] of 1,200 idled metal-trades workers. Then occurred an incident that would set back Los Angeles organizing for years: on October 10, 1910, a bomb exploded at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper plant that killed 21 workers.\n\nIn the decade following, the rapid growth of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW, or Wobblies) in un-unionized trades, logging, wheat farming, and lumber camps began extending its efforts to mines, ports and agriculture. The IWW came to public notice after the [[Wheatland Hop Riot]], when a sheriff's posse broke up a protest meeting and four people died. It led to the first legislation protecting [[farmworker|field labor]]. The IWW was harmed by anti-union drives and prosecution of members under the [[California Criminal Syndicalism Act]].\n\nThe IWW was also involved in the 1923 seamen's strike at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], where [[Upton Sinclair]] was arrested for reciting the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. The man who became the most prominent Wobbly of all, [[Thomas Mooney]], soon became a ''cause-celebre'' of labor and the most important [[political prisoner]] in America.\n\n===Labor in the 1920s===\nThe [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] killed ten people and hurt labor for decades. During the 1920s, the open shop efforts succeeded through a coordinated strategy called the \"[[American Plan (union negotiations)|American Plan]]\". In one case, the Industrial Association of San Francisco raised over a million dollars to break the building trades strikes in 1921 that led to the collapse of the building trades unions. This [[Employers' organization|employers association]] cut wages twice in one year, and the Metal Trades Council was defeated, losing an agreement that had been in effect since 1907. The Seamen's Union also suffered defeat in 1921.\n\n===Labor in the 1930s===\n\n====Labor unions====\nUnions grew rapidly after 1935 with political and legal support from the national [[New Deal]] and its [[Wagner Act]] of 1935. The most serious strike came in 1934 along the state's ports. In May 1934, dock workers and [[longshoremen]] along the West Coast [[Strike action|went on strike]] for better hours and pay, a union hiring hall and a coast-wide contract. [[Communist party|Communists]] were in control of the union, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), led by [[Harry Bridges]] (1901\u20131990).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Robert W. Cherny, \"Prelude to the Popular Front: The Communist Party in California, 1931\u201335.\" ''American Communist History'' 2002 1(1): 5\u201342 online at [[EBSCO]]</ref>\n\nOn \"Bloody Thursday\", July 5, 1934, San Francisco was swept by bloody rioting. Striking maritime workers, pitting themselves against police, took control of much of the waterfront and warehouse areas of the city. Two workers were killed and hundreds were clubbed and gassed. The West Coast Waterfront Strike lasted 83 days, with longshoremen returning to work on July 31. [[Arbitration]] was agreed to, and it resulted in a victory for the strikers and the unionization of all West Coast ports in the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Lange-no-on-one-1938.jpg|thumb|[[Kern County, California|Kern County]], April 1938. An agricultural worker with union membership book and pin against the 1938 anti-picketing ballot. (Photo: Dorothea Lange)]]\n\nSan Francisco in the late 1930s had 120,000 union members. Longshoremen wore union buttons on their white union-made caps, [[Teamsters]] drove trucks as unionists, and fishermen, taxi drivers, streetcar conductors, motormen, newsboys, retail clerks, hotel employees, newspapermen and [[bootblack]]s all had representation. Against 30,000 trade union members in 1933\u201334, Los Angeles by the late thirties had 200,000, even against a severe 1938 anti-[[picketing]] ordinance. But Los Angeles became unionized in the mass production industries of aircraft, auto, rubber, and oil, and at the yards of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]]. Later, drives for unionization spread through musicians, teamsters, building trades, movies, actors, writers and directors.\n\n====Farm labor====\nFarm labor remained unorganized, the work brutal and underpaid. In the 1930s, 200,000 farm laborers traveled the state in tune with the seasons.{{fact|date=September 2019}} Unions were accused of an \"inland march\" against landowners' rights when they took up the early effort to organize farm labor. A number of valley towns endorsed anti-picketing ordinances to thwart organizing.\n\nIn the 1933\u20131934 period, a wave of agricultural strikes flooded the Central Valley, including the [[Imperial Valley]] lettuce strike and San Joaquin Valley cotton strike. In the 1936 [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] lettuce strike, [[vigilante]] violence shocked the nation. Again, in the spring of 1938, about three hundred men, women and children were driven by vigilantes from their homes in [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]] and [[Nevada City, California|Nevada City]].\n\nA 1938 ballot proposition against picketing, \"Proposition #1\", considered [[fascist]] by commentators for the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|state grange]], became a huge political struggle. Proposition #1 failed at the polls. Soon, [[racism|racist]] distinctions fell as California unions began to admit non-white members.\n\nBy the advent of [[World War II]], California had an old-age assistance law, [[unemployment compensation]], a 48-hour work week maximum for women, an [[apprentice]] law, and [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] rules.\n\n====Okies====\n\"[[Okie]]s\" were the 250,000 hard-luck migrants who fled the [[Dust Bowl]] and depression in [[Oklahoma]] and neighboring states in the 1930s in search of a better future. Many sought farm labor jobs advertised in the Central Valley. They were harshly disparaged at the time. Police were stationed at the [[Arizona]] line to keep them out, and the state legislature passed a law to keep them out, but it was overturned by the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref>Nancy J. Taniguchi, \"California's 'Anti-Okie' Law: An Interpretive Biography,\" ''Western Legal History: The Journal of the Ninth Judicial Circuit Historical Society'' (1995) 8#2 pp 272\u2013290.</ref> Historian James Gregory has explored the long-term impact of the Okies on California society. Gregory finds that most came from urban backgrounds, and one in six had been a [[white-collar worker]]. He notes that in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]],'' novelist [[John Steinbeck]] saw the migrants becoming active agitators for unions and the New Deal, demanding higher wages and better housing conditions. Steinbeck did not foresee that most Okies would move into well-paid jobs in war industries in the 1940s. The children and grandchildren of the Okies seldom returned to Oklahoma. They did leave the farms and became concentrated in Southern California's cities and suburbs. Long-term cultural impacts include a commitment to [[evangelical Protestantism]] (especially the [[Pentecostals]] and the [[Southern Baptists]]<ref>Thomas D.

Other radical movements flourished, such as the [[Francis Townsend|Townsend Plan]] for old age pension, and \"Ham and Eggs\", which promised \"$30 Every Thursday\" to everyone over age 50. Voters narrowly rejected it in 1938, and the utopians failed to enact any panaceas; however, the movements did spawn a generation of activists on the left.<ref>Daniel J. B.

Beginning before 1900, California has built extensive water projects costing many billions of dollars to store and move water where it is needed. California water comes primarily from snowfall in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the northern part of the state during the relatively short winter from about October to March. The rest of the year typically has very little rainfall or snowfall. California weather is also prone to extended [[drought]]s that can last several years.

Starting in about 1901, [[San Francisco]] started looking for a new supply of municipal water. Following the disastrous [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire, this search intensified, and they finally chose the Tuolumne River as the \"best\" available water resource. The City and County of San Francisco bought most of the water rights to the Tuolumne River watershed in 1910. The Hetch Hetchy project centered on damming the main Tuolumne River as it meandered through Hetch Hetchy's wide glacial-cut valley. The river, with its source in a perpetual glacier on {{convert|13000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]], drains {{convert|650|mi2|km2}} of watershed of the rugged granite mountains sloping west from the Sierra Nevada crest. The Hetch Hetchy water system's goal was providing up to {{convert|400000000|gal|l}} of water per day to San Francisco and the growing [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Region]] and tap the [[hydroelectric]] power that would be generated by a dam and power stations. After a vigorous debate, the United States Congress passed the [[Raker Act]] in 1913 which authorized the building of dam(s), hydroelectricity plant and municipal water supply system inside part of Yosemite National Park. The act was signed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in February 1916.\n\nA key element of the plan was a new dam and reservoir in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, but access to the area was poor, so a railroad was planned to help build the dam. The steep terrain dictated a 4-degree roadbed, roughly twice as steep as a \"regular\" railroad. The steep grades dictated geared-down locomotives. The first {{convert|9|mi|0}} of the [[Hetch Hetchy Railroad]] (HHRR) were completed in 1915, and the remaining {{convert|59|mi}} were completed by October 1917. Construction costs for the HHRR were about US$3 million, far less than what the city might have paid contractors to transport workers, concrete and other materials for the dam over the rough and steep terrain by 12 mule train wagons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The president of the railroad was San Francisco Mayor James Rolph, and the vice president and general manager was the construction project's chief engineer [[Michael O'Shaughnessy]].

At {{convert|602|ft}} high, the dam is the [[List of the tallest dams in the United States|ninth-tallest dam in the United States]] and forms the largest reservoir in California.\n\nShasta Dam was envisioned as early as 1919 because of frequent floods and droughts troubling California's largest agricultural region, the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. Shasta Dam was first authorized in the 1930s as a state undertaking. However, this coincided with the [[Great Depression]], and building of the dam was transferred to the federal [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]] as a public works project. Construction started in earnest in 1937 under the supervision of Chief Engineer [[Frank Crowe]]. During its building, the dam provided thousands of much-needed jobs; it was finished 26 months ahead of schedule in 1945. When completed, the dam was the second-tallest in the United States after [[Hoover Dam|Hoover]], and was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of all time.\n\nEven before its dedication, Shasta Dam served an important role in [[World War II]], providing electricity to California factories, and it still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources. However, it has brought about major changes to the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River, and met with controversy over its significant destruction of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribal lands. In recent years, there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and hydropower generation.\n\n'''[[Pardee Dam]]''' is a {{convert|345|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} structure across the [[Mokelumne River]] on the boundary between [[Amador County, California|Amador]] and [[Calaveras County, California|Calaveras]] counties, in the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] approximately {{convert|30|mi}} northeast of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]].

The aqueduct impounds water from the [[Colorado River]] at [[Lake Havasu]] on the California\u2013[[Arizona]] border. This water is then transferred west by pumping stations, reservoirs, and canals across the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] and [[Colorado Desert|Colorado]] deserts to the east side of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]]. It is one of the primary sources of [[drinking water]] for Southern California.\n\nOriginally conceived by [[William Mulholland]] and designed by Chief Engineer Frank E. Weymouth of the MWD, it was the largest public works project in southern California during the [[Great Depression]]. The project employed 30,000 people over an eight-year period and as many as 10,000 at one time.<ref name='kysq'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kysq.org/docs/WPEE_CRA.pdf | title = Colorado River Aqueduct | accessdate = 2010-11-20 | last = Zetland | first = David | date = August 5, 2009 | work = kysq.org | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010805/http://www.kysq.org/docs/WPEE_CRA.pdf | archive-date = July 27, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe system is composed of two reservoirs, five pumping stations, {{convert|63|mi}} of canals, {{convert|92|mi}} of tunnels, and {{convert|84|mi}} of buried conduit and siphons.

Davis Dam stretches across the border between [[Arizona]] and [[Nevada]] and impounds the Colorado River to form [[Lake Mohave]]. The [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] owns and operates the dam, which was completed in 1951. Davis Dam is a zoned [[earth fill]] dam with a [[concrete]] spillway, {{convert|1600|ft}} in length at the crest, and {{convert|200|ft}} high. The earth fill dam begins on the Nevada side, but it does not extend to the Arizona side. Instead, there is an inlet formed by earth and concrete. At the end of the inlet is the [[spillway]]. The [[power plant]] is on the Arizona side of the inlet, perpendicular to the dam. This is a very unusual design. The [[hydroelectric]] plant generates between 1 and 2 [[watt-hour|terawatt-hours]] of electricity annually. The plant has a capacity of {{convert|251|MW|abbr=on|lk=on}}, and the tops of its five [[Francis turbine]]s are visible from outside the plant. The plant's [[hydraulic head]] is {{convert|136|ft}}. The dam's purpose is to generate hydroelectricity and regulate water releases into the Colorado River for use downstream by California, Arizona and [[Mexico]].\n\n[[File:Imperial Dam.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Imperial Dam]] on the Colorado River at the head of the [[All-American Canal]]]]\n\n'''[[Imperial Dam]]''' is a [[Arch dam|concrete slab and buttress]], [[dam#Spillways|ogee weir]] structure across the [[Colorado River]] on the California\u2013Arizona border, {{convert|18|mi}} northeast of [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]]. Completed in the 1938, the dam retains the waters of the Colorado River in the [[Imperial Reservoir]] before desilting and diversion into the [[All-American Canal]], the [[Gila River]], and the [[Yuma Project]] aqueduct. Between 1932 and 1940, the [[Imperial Irrigation District]] relied on the Inter-California Canal, the [[Alamo Canal|Imperial Canal]], and the [[Alamo River]].\n\nImperial Dam was built to replace the Laguna Diversion Dam, built in 1901\u20131915, which was the first dam and reclamation project on the Colorado River. Imperial Dam was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and 72 {{convert|770|ft|adj=on}} scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six sludge pipes running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California sluiceway, which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this location. Diversions can top {{convert|40000|cuft}} per second\u2014more than 50 times the flow of the [[Rio Grande]].\n\nThe Gila River and the Yuma Project aqueduct branch off toward Arizona, while the All-American Canal branches southwards for {{convert|37|mi}} before reaching its headworks on the California border and bending west toward the [[Imperial Valley]].\n[[File:All-American 2009.jpg|thumb|260px|View of the {{convert|15|km|mi|order=flip}} [[Coachella Canal]] (part of the [[All-American Canal]]) just west of [[Yuma, Arizona]]; north is to the upper right.]]\n\nThe '''All-American Canal''' is an {{convert|80|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} aqueduct in southeastern California. It conveys water from the [[Colorado River]] into the [[Imperial Valley]] and to nine cities. It is the Imperial Valley's only water source, and replaced the [[Alamo Canal]], which was located mostly in Mexico. The [[Imperial Dam]], about {{convert|30|mi}} northeast of [[Yuma, Arizona]], on the Colorado River, diverts water into the All-American Canal, which runs to just west of [[Calexico, California]], before its last branch heads mostly north into the Imperial Valley. Five smaller canals branching off the All-American Canal move water into the Imperial Valley. These canal systems irrigate up to {{convert|630000|acre|ha}} of good cropland and have made possible a greatly increased crop yield in this area, originally one of the driest on earth. It is the largest irrigation canal in the world, carrying a maximum of {{convert|26155|cuft/s|m3/s}}. [[Surface runoff|Agricultural runoff]] from the All-American Canal drains into the [[Salton Sea]]. The All-American Canal runs parallel to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] for several miles.\n\nThe '''[[Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel]]''' (also known as the \"Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel\" or \"SRDWSC\") is a [[canal]] from the [[Port of Sacramento]] to the [[Sacramento River]], which flows into [[San Francisco Bay]]. It was completed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1963. The channel is about {{convert|30|ft}} deep, {{convert|200|ft}} wide, and {{convert|43|mi}} long.\n\nThe Port of Sacramento has always been a significant port on the [[West Coast of the United States]] since the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]]. It was originally served primarily by [[paddle steamer]]s which carried cargo from San Francisco Bay up the Sacramento River to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. Today it receives far less traffic than larger ports and handles primarily agricultural products and other bulk goods rather than [[containerization|containers]], which now dominate the shipping market.\n\nOther engineering feats were the building of [[Hoover Dam]], which though in Nevada, provides power and water to Southern California.\n\nAnother project was the draining of [[Tulare Lake]], which during high water was the largest freshwater lake fully inside an American state. This created a large wet area amid the dry [[San Joaquin Valley]], and swamps abounded at its shores. By the 1970s, it was completely drained, but it attempts to resurrect itself during heavy rains.\n\n===Water recycling===\nThe recycling of treated municipal wastewater has become a significant part of California's water supply. The different water agencies in California were recycling over {{convert|770000|acre.ft|m3}} as of 2009, the date of the last survey. Some of the many uses for recycled water are: golf course irrigation 7%, landscape irrigation 17%, agricultural irrigation 37%, commercial reuse of water 7%, industrial uses 7%, geothermal energy production 1%, seawater intrusion barrier via fresh water injections 7%, groundwater recharge by well injection and flotation ponds 12%, recreational impoundments 4%, and natural wetland systems/restoration 4%.<ref>[http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/grants_loans/water_recycling/munirec.shtml California Municipal Wastewater Recycling Survey-2009]. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> The stated goal is the recycling of {{convert|1600000|acre.ft|m3}} of treated municipal wastewater.\n\nOn March 14, 2014, the State Water Board approved $800 million in financial incentives for recycled water projects.<ref>[http://ca.gov/drought/story-1.html Water Recycling Funding Program]. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> These projects typically take years to get approved and built.\n\nThe '''Water Replenishment District of Southern California''' ('''WRD'''), in service since 1959, is one of the more aggressive agencies that use recycled water for their groundwater replenishment and seawater intrusion barriers.<ref>[http://www.wrd.org/ Water Replenishment District]. Accessed 3 April 2014</ref> To prevent seawater contamination of their groundwater, they have several sets of [[injection well]]s that inject clean water between their [[aquifer]] and the sea. This creates a local water barrier to seawater intrusion. The other mechanism is to make sure the water level is above sea level.\n\nWell users, including municipal water users, in the WRD area pump about {{convert|250000|acre.ft|m3}} of water per year out of their aquifer. This is an \"overdraft\" of about {{convert|150000|acre.ft|m3}} of water over what their underground aquifer can \"normally\" refill. To replace this \"overdraft\" of water into the aquifer, they have flotation ponds that catch rain runoff water, and supplement with other water they either buy or recycle, then let the water soak into the ground (spreading water) to help replenish the water in the aquifer(s). In addition they buy [[Colorado River]] water that is shipped via the [[Colorado River Aqueduct]], and they accept part of the treated municipal wastewater of the about 4,000,000 people in their district and treat it to additional purity and sanitation levels by using [[reverse osmosis]] and advanced filtering. Their largest [[sewage treatment#tertiary treatment|tertiary water treatment]] facility is the Leo J. Vander Lans Advanced Water Treatment facility. The water out of this facility is better than the water that comes out of the \"average\" municipal water treatment facility.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} To finance their water recycling projects WRD charges $268 per acre-foot of water pumped out, which generates about $65,000,000/year.<ref>[http://www.wrd.org/March_2014_ESR.pdf WRD engineering report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401142909/http://www.wrd.org/March_2014_ESR.pdf |date=2014-04-01 }}. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> WRD is now on a project (WIN) to enlarge their water treatment facilities to take larger quantities of treated municipal wastewater and treat enough of it that they will not have to buy Colorado River water. Overall it is estimated that this project provides over 40% of the water used in the Southern California district served by the WRD.\n\nAmong the many water recycling projects just being completed, the South Bay Water Recycling program distributes recycled water to more than 400 customers in the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], area for irrigation, industrial and other purposes. In Northern California, two agencies have teamed up to develop the San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Program. Jointly sponsored by the Dublin San Ramon Services District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the program will provide recycled water to municipal parks, golf courses, business parks, greenbelts and roadways. The Irvine Ranch Water District has built a dual water system, which supplies recycled water to commercial high rises for use in flushing toilets and urinals. A West Basin Municipal Water District project distributes recycled water to more than 85 customers, including [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and [[Mobil]] refineries. Monterey County Water Recycling Projects provide recycled water for agricultural irrigation to help ease demands on an overused groundwater aquifer. The Padre Dam Water Recycling Facility was expanded to recycle 2 million gallons/day for turf irrigation at parks, golf courses and other commercial and industrial facilities.\n\nIn the [[San Diego]] region, 16 water agencies are planning to use over {{convert|32300|acre.ft|m3}} of recycled water per year in order to meet the region's water supply demand. The city of [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad's]] new recycled water treatment and distribution system will deliver approximately {{convert|3000|acre.ft|m3}}} per year of recycled water to customers located in that community. In the southern portion of [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], the Otay Water District is constructing a distribution system to deliver an estimated {{convert|5000|acre.ft|m3}} per year of recycled water by 2030 purchased from the city of San Diego's South Bay Water Recycling Plant. In Southern California, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District is using recycled water to help replenish and enhance [[Lake Elsinore]].\n\nThe Orange County Sanitation and Orange County Water Districts are planning for treated wastewater, currently discharged into the ocean, to undergo [[microfiltration]], [[reverse osmosis]] and [[ultraviolet disinfection]]. The purified water will be equivalent in quality to distilled water and exceed all state and federal drinking water standards. The purified water will be pumped to spreading ponds near the [[Santa Ana River]] for [[percolation]] into the groundwater basin, with some injected through injection wells along the coast as a barrier to seawater intrusion. Like the WRD projects in Southern California, the Orange County Water District has amassed a long record of successfully recycling water with its Water Factory 21.<ref>[http://www.ocwd.com/About/HistoricalInformation.aspx Water Factory 21]. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref>\n\n===Desalination projects===\nOn December 24, 2012, the San Diego County Water Authority announced they had sold $734 million worth of tax-free bonds at 4.38% interest to build the Carlsbad Seawater Desalination Project, the largest seawater [[desalination]] plant in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The project is located near the Encina Power Station in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], and is expected to produce about {{convert|56000|acre.ft|m3}} of water per year by 2016 when the project is completed. The plant is expected to use over 17,000 reverse osmosis racks. The project includes $80 million in San Diego Water Authority upgrades to its own facilities. A {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} pipeline is being built to deliver desalinated water into its Twin Oaks Valley Water Treatment Plant near [[San Marcos, California|San Marcos]]. The developer Poseidon Resources is building the plant and pipeline in a [[joint venture]] with contractor Kiewit Shea Desalination. The project will deliver up to 50 million gallons a day of drought-proof, highly reliable water that will become a core, day-to-day resource for the region. It is projected to meet about 7% of San Diego County's demand in 2020. The total cost is projected at $1,849 to $2,257 per acre-foot.<ref>[http://www.sdcwa.org/734-million-carlsbad-desalination-project-financing-closes-0 Carlsbad Desalination Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082902/http://www.sdcwa.org/734-million-carlsbad-desalination-project-financing-closes-0 |date=2014-04-07 }}.

Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> The additional cost of desalinating seawater will add $5 to $7 per month to ratepayers' bills\u2014about a 10% increase.\n\nThe present (2014) drought has brought reconsideration of the Charles Meyer Desalination Facility that was built for $34 million in the early 1990s in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] but was later essentially mothballed when the drought was over. There are early discussions about investing around $20 million more to upgrade and restart the desalination plant.

Before that nearly all long-distance travel was by railroad or stagecoach, with horse- or mule-drawn wagons hauling the freight. A key route was the [[Lincoln Highway]], which was America's first transcontinental road for motorized vehicles, connecting [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]]. The creation of the Lincoln Highway in 1913 was a major stimulus on the development of both industry and tourism in the state. Similar effects occurred in 1926 with the creation of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. The last large addition to the state highway system was made by the [[California State Assembly]] in 1959, after which only minor changes have been made. Most new highway construction was then done on the [[Interstate Highway System]] started under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who championed its formation.\n\nThe first state road was authorized on March 26, 1895, when a law created the post of \"[[Lake Tahoe]] Wagon Road Commissioner\" to maintain the [[Lake Tahoe Wagon Road]] (the 1852 [[Johnson's Cut-off]] of the [[California Trail]]), now [[U.S. Route 50 in California|US 50]] from [[Smith Flat, California|Smith Flat]], {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of [[Placerville, California|Placerville]], to the [[Nevada]] state line.<ref>\"An act to authorize the state of California to secure the title to and right of way for that certain wagon-road...commencing a short distance easterly from the village of Smith's Flat...and running thence to Lake Tahoe...\", approved March 26, 1895, chapter 128, p. 119 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uzoIUIQbCdgC&pg=RA11-PA25-IA4 Report of the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road Commissioner], November 29, 1898</ref> The {{convert|58|mi|adj=on}} road had been operated as a privately owned [[toll road]] from about 1855 till 1886, when [[El Dorado County, California|El Dorado County]] bought it; the county [[deed]]ed the road to the state on February 28, 1896.<ref name=centennial>[[California Highways and Public Works]], ''Centennial Edition'', September 9, 1950</ref> Funding initially was only enough for minimal improvements, including a [[bridge|stone bridge]] over the [[South Fork American River]] in 1901.<ref>Department of Engineering (1917), p. 181</ref>\n\n[[File:California Bureau of Highways 1896.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Bureau of Highways with their [[buckboard wagon]] in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], 1896]]\n\nAlso in 1895, on March 27 the legislature created the three-person [[Bureau of Highways (California)|Bureau of Highways]] to coordinate efforts by the [[list of counties in California|counties]] to build [[good roads]].

In 1925, aircraft builder [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]] and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' publisher [[Harry Chandler]] worked together with Caltech president [[Robert Millikan]] to bring a state-of-the-art aeronautical research laboratory to the Pasadena college. Douglas recruited some of Caltech's best and brightest students for his company. Douglas utilized the lab's [[wind tunnel]] and research staff while designing his [[DC-1]], [[DC-2|2]], and [[DC-3|3]]. In this way, the DC-3, undoubtedly one of the most successful aircraft designs ever built, represented more than just a single designer's project. It was a regional product, the result of an alliance of business and science created over the preceding five decades.\n\nThe Caltech [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) traces its beginnings to 1936 in the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT), when the first set of rocket experiments were carried out in the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]]. Caltech graduate students [[Frank Malina]], Weld Arnold, [[Apollo M. O. Smith]], and [[Tsien Hsue-shen]], along with [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]] and Edward S. Forman, tested a small, alcohol-fueled motor to gather data for Malina's graduate thesis. Malina's thesis adviser was engineer-aerodynamicist [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], who eventually arranged for United States Army financial support for this \"GALCIT Rocket Project\" in 1939. In 1941, Malina, Parsons, Forman, [[Martin Summerfield]], and pilot Homer Bushey demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff rockets ([[JATO]] units) to the Army.  In 1943, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Malina, Parsons, and Forman established the Aerojet Corporation to manufacture JATO motors. The project took on the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory in November 1943, formally becoming an Army facility operated under contract by the university.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early Years | url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/settingstakes.php | publisher=JPL}}</ref><ref name=\"Koppes\">{{cite web | first=Clayton | last=Koppes | title=JPL and the American Space Program | location=New Haven | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | year=1982}}</ref><ref name=Conway>{{cite web | first=Erik M. | last=Conway | title=From Rockets to Spacecraft: Making JPL a Place for Planetary Science | work=Engineering and Science | volume = 30 | issue=4 | pages=2\u201310 | url=http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/ESarchive-frame.html}}</ref><ref name=\"High Frontier\">{{cite book | last=Launius | first=Roger | title=To Reach High Frontier, A History of U.S. Launch Vehicles | year=2002 | publisher=[[University of Kentucky]] | isbn=978-0-8131-2721-7 | pages=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\nDuring JPL's Army years, the laboratory developed two deployed weapon systems, the [[MGM-5 Corporal]] and [[MGM-29 Sergeant]] intermediate range [[ballistic missile]]s, the first US ballistic missiles developed at JPL.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Keymeulen, Didier |author2=Myers, John |author3=Newton, Jason |author4=Csaszar, Ambrus |author5=Gan, Quan |author6=Hidalgo, Tim |author7=Moore, Jeff |author8=Sandoval, Steven |author9=Xu, Jiajing |author10=Schon, Aaron |author11=Assad, Chris |author12=Stoica, Adrian | title=Humanoids for Lunar and Planetary Surface Operations | hdl=2014/39699 | work=Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], 2006 | publisher=JPL TRS 1992+ }}</ref> It also developed a number of other weapons system prototypes, such as the [[Loki (rocket)|Loki]] anti-aircraft missile system, and the forerunner of the [[Aerobee]] sounding rocket.

Numerous air-training bases were established in Southern California, where most aircraft manufacturers, including [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Hughes Aircraft]], expanded or established factories. Major [[United States Navy|naval]] shipyards were established or expanded in San Diego, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], and [[Mare Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\n===California shipping===\n{{Further|Maritime history of California}}\n\n====Kaiser\u2013Permanente California shipyards====\n[[File:SS John W Brown.jpg|thumb|right|300px|{{SS|John W. Brown}} is one of only two surviving operational [[Liberty ship]]s.]]\n{{Further|Richmond Shipyards}}\n\nThe four [[Richmond Shipyards]], located in the city of [[Richmond, California]], were run by [[Permanente Metals]] and [[Kaiser Shipyards]]. The Richmond yards were responsible for constructing more [[Liberty ship]]s during World War II (747) than any other shipyard in the United States. Liberty ships were chosen for mass production because their somewhat obsolete design was relatively simple and their triple expansion piston [[steam engine]] components were simple enough that they could be made by several companies that were not highly needed to manufacture other parts. Ship building was given a high priority for steel and other needed components, as the German [[U-boat]]s until 1944 sunk more ships than could be built by all the shipyards in the United States. The United States shipyards built about 5,926 ships in World War II<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/merchantships.htm#MERCHANT_SHIP_CONSTRUCTION_IN_WWII Ships built in U.S. in WW-II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125224039/http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/merchantships.htm#MERCHANT_SHIP_CONSTRUCTION_IN_WWII |date=2013-11-25 }} Accessed 12 February 2012</ref> plus over 100,000 more smallcraft made for the [[List of ships of the United States Army|U.S. Army naval components]].\n\n[[Henry J. Kaiser]]'s company had been building [[cargo ship]]s for the [[U.S. Maritime Commission]] in the late 1930s. In 1940 orders for ships from the British government, already at war with [[Nazi Germany]], allowed for growth. Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard beginning in December 1940, eventually building three more in Richmond; each yard with four to eight slips to build ships. Kaiser-Permanente specialized in mass-producing Liberty ships quickly and efficiently, and that was all they built until 1944, when they switched to the much more complicated [[Victory ship]]s and built some [[tug]]s and [[Landing Ship, Tank]] (LSTs) and other specialized ships in the newly built Yard #4.\n\n747 EC2-S-C1 Liberty ship cargo transports were built. The following references list individual ships built:\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #1; Oceans, Libertys, Victorys; built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #1 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #2; Libertys, Victorys built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #2 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #3; Libertys, Victorys; built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #3 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #4; [[Landing Ship, Tank]]s (LST)s, Tugs; built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #4 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser, California Shipbuilding; Libertys, Victorys; built in Los Angeles<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kcalifornia.htm Kaiser, California Shipbuilding Los Angeles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510113117/http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kcalifornia.htm |date=2012-05-10 }} Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\t\n\nThese Liberty ships were completed in two-thirds the amount of time and at a quarter of the cost of the average of all other shipyards. The Liberty ship {{SS|Robert E. Peary}} was assembled in less than five days as a part of a special competition among shipyards; but by 1944 it was only taking the astonishingly brief time of a little over two weeks to assemble a Liberty ship by standard methods. They pre-assembled major parts of the ship including the hull sections at various locations in the shipyard and then, when needed, moved them with heavy lift cranes to the shipyard launching site, where they welded the pre-built sections together. After the ships were launched they were finished to their final configuration while afloat, and the launchway was available to start building another ship.\n\nIn 1945, the shipyards were shut down as quickly as they had started up four years earlier. Much of the shoreline previously occupied by the shipyards is now owned by the city of Richmond and has been cleaned up and redeveloped under federally assisted \"[[brownfields]]\" programs. The [[Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park]] was established on the shipyard site to commemorate and interpret the role of the home front in winning World War II.\n\n* Richmond Shipyards Images<ref>Richmond Shipyards Images [http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/browse/azBrowse/Richmond+Shipyards Images and oral history transcripts describing the early days of the Richmond Shipyards] Accessed 13 June 2011</ref><ref>Kaiser Permanente Shipyard building etc.[http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/kaiser-richmond_1.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829051031/http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/Kaiser-Richmond_1.htm |date=2013-08-29 }} Accessed 12 February 2012</ref>\n*Map of Kaiser-Permanente Yard #1, #2, #3 and #4<ref>Map of Kaiser-Permanente Yard #1, #2 [http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/kaiser-richmond_15a.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213020601/http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/kaiser-richmond_15a.htm |date=2012-02-13 }} Accessed 12 February 2012</ref>\n* Kaiser Shipyards<ref>Kaiser Shipyards [http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/Kaiser-Richmond_1.htm Permanente Metals Corporation \u2013 Kaiser Richmond CA Shipyards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829051031/http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/Kaiser-Richmond_1.htm |date=2013-08-29 }} 13 June 2011</ref>\n\n====California Shipbuilding Corporation====\n[[File:RedOakVictory2010Aug19.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Victory ship]] [[SS Red Oak Victory|SS ''Red Oak Victory'' (AK-235)]], now a museum ship]]\n{{Further|California Shipbuilding Corporation}}\n[[California Shipbuilding Corporation]] (often called Calship) built 467 [[Liberty ship|Liberty]] and [[Victory ship]]s during World War II, including [[Haskell-class attack transport|''Haskell''-class]] [[attack transport]]s. The Calship [[shipyard]] was created at [[Terminal Island]] in Los Angeles as part of the World War II shipbuilding effort. It was initially eight [[Slipway|ways]], then increased to 14. After the war, it was liquidated.

The [[Napa River]] forms the eastern side of the island as the river enters the [[Carquinez Strait]] at its juncture with the east side of [[San Pablo Bay]]. In 1850, Commodore [[John Drake Sloat]], in charge of a commission to find a California naval base, recommended the island across the Napa River from the settlement of Vallejo, it being \"free from ocean gales and from floods and freshets.\"\n\nOn November 6, 1850, two months after California was admitted to statehood, President [[Millard Fillmore]] reserved Mare Island for government use. The United States Navy Department acted favorably on Commodore Sloat's recommendations, and Mare Island was purchased in July 1852, for the sum of $83,410, for the use as a naval shipyard. Two years later, on September 16, 1854, Mare Island became the first permanent United States naval installation on the West Coast, with Commodore [[David G. Farragut]] as Mare Island's first base commander. For more than a century, Mare Island served as the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]]. A {{convert|508|ft|adj=on}} [[drydock]] was built by the Public Works Department on an excellent rock foundation of cut granite blocks. The work took nineteen years and was completed in 1891. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], a concrete drydock on wooden piles, {{convert|740|ft}} long, was completed after eleven years of work, in 1910. By 1941, a third drydock had been completed, and drydock number four was under construction. The ammunitions depot and submarine repair base were modern, fireproof buildings. A million-dollar, three-way vehicle [[causeway]] to Vallejo was completed.\n\nBefore World War II, Mare Island had been in a continual state of upbuilding. By 1941, new projects included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large [[foundry]], [[machine shop]], [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several finger piers had recently{{when|date=October 2015}} been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} and one {{convert|750|ft|adj=on}} berth. It employed 5,593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 busily engaged by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3,500,000 (1941). Then came the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital carried 584 bed patients. Mare Island became one of the Navy's shipbuilding sites in World War II specializing in building [[diesel engine]]-powered [[submarine]]s; they eventually built 32 of them. After the war was over, Mare Island became a premier site for building [[nuclear-powered submarine]]s, building 27 of them.\n\nIn 1969, the Navy transferred its (Vietnam War) Brown Water Navy Riverine Training Forces from [[Coronado, California]], to Mare Island. Swift Boats (Patrol Craft Fast-PCF), and PBRs (Patrol Boat River), among other types of riverine craft, conducted boat operations throughout the currently named Napa-Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, which are located on the north and west portions of Mare Island. Mare Island Naval Base was deactivated during the 1995 cycle of US base closures, but the US Navy Reserves still have access to the water portions of the State Wildlife Area for any riverine warfare training being conducted from their new base in Sacramento.\n\nIn 1996 Mare Island Naval Shipyard was closed.\n\n===Naval Base San Diego===\n[[File:San Diego Naval Base.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aerial view of Naval Base San Diego]]\n{{Further|Naval Base San Diego}}\n\n[[Naval Base San Diego]] was started on land acquired in 1920. It is the largest base of the [[United States Navy]] on the west coast of the United States. Naval Base San Diego is the principal homeport of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], consisting of 54 ships and over 120 tenant commands. The base is composed of 13 piers stretched over {{convert|977|acres|sqkm}} of land and {{convert|326|acres|sqkm}} of water. The total on-base population is 20,000 military personnel and 6,000 civilians. San Diego has become the home port of the largest naval fleet in the world, and includes two [[supercarrier]]s, as well as [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] stations, United States Navy ports, and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] installations.\n\n==Growth after World War II==\nAfter the war, hundreds of land developers bought land cheap, subdivided it, built on it, and got rich. [[Real estate development]] replaced oil and agriculture as Southern California's principal industry. In 1955, [[Disneyland]] opened in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. In 1958, [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] left New York City and came to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The population of California expanded dramatically, to nearly 20 million by 1970.\n\nIn the late 1960s the [[baby boomer|baby-boom generation]] reached draft age, and many risked arrest to oppose the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. There were numerous demonstrations and strikes, most famously on the prestigious [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley campus]] of the [[University of California]], across the bay from San Francisco. In 1965, [[race riot]]s [[Watts riots|erupted in Watts]], in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central area]] of Los Angeles. The hippie riots on the [[Sunset Strip]] in Los Angeles were immortalized by [[Buffalo Springfield]] in the song \"[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]\" (1966). Some commentators predicted revolution. Then the federal government promised to withdraw from the Vietnam War, which at last happened in 1974. The radical political movements, having achieved a large part of their aim, lost members and funding.\n\nCalifornia still was a land of free spirits, open hearts, and easy-going living. Popular music of the period bore titles such as \"[[California Girls]],\" \"[[California Dreamin']],\" \"[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]],\" \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\". These reflected the Californian promise of easy living in a paradisaical climate. The [[surfing culture]] burgeoned. Many people took [[low-paying job]]s and joined the surfers living in trailers at the beach, and many others forsook ambition and joined the [[hippie]]s living in cities.\n\nThe most famous hippie hangout was the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district of San Francisco. The state's cities, especially San Francisco, became famous for their gentility and tolerance. A distinctive and idyllic Californian culture emerged for a time. The peak of this culture, in 1967, was known as the [[Summer of Love]]. California became known elsewhere in the United States often derogatorily, as the \"land of fruits and nuts\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==California as an economic powerhouse==\nConversely, during the same period, the Golden State also attracted commercial and industrial expansion at astronomical rates. The adoption of a [[California Master Plan for Higher Education|Master Plan for Higher Education]] in 1960 allowed the development of a highly efficient system of public higher education in the [[community college]]s and the [[University of California]] and [[California State University]] systems; by creating an educated workforce, it attracted investment, particularly in areas related to [[high tech]]nology. By 1980, California became recognized as the world's eighth-largest economy. Millions of workers were needed to fuel the expansion. The high population of the time caused tremendous problems with urban sprawl, traffic, pollution, and, to a lesser extent, crime.\n\n[[Urban sprawl]] created a backlash in many areas, with local governments limiting growth beyond certain boundaries, reducing lot sizes for building homes, and so on. [[Urban open space|Open space districts]] were created in several parts of the state specifically to obtain, manage, and preserve undeveloped land. For example, in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the open space districts have created a nearly contiguous range of permanently undeveloped land running through the coastal range and hills surrounding the Bay's urban valleys, enabling the creation of huge natural parks and envisioning a hiking trail that will eventually circumnavigate the Bay in an unbroken loop.\n\nThe immense problem with [[air pollution]] ([[smog]]) that had developed by the early 1970s also caused a backlash. With schools being closed routinely in urban areas for \"smog days\" when the [[ozone]] levels became too unhealthy and the hills surrounding urban areas seldom visible even within a mile, Californians were ready for changes. Over the next three decades, California enacted some of the strictest anti-smog regulations in the United States and has been a leader in encouraging nonpolluting strategies for various industries, including automobiles. For example, [[carpool lane]]s normally allow only vehicles with two/three or more occupants (whether the base number is two or three depends on what freeway you are on), but [[electric car]]s can use the lanes with only a single occupant. As a result, smog is significantly reduced from its peak, although local [[Environmental engineering|Air Quality Management]] Districts still monitor the air and generally encourage people to avoid polluting activities on hot days when smog is expected to be at its worst.\n\nTraffic and transportation remain a problem in urban areas. Solutions are implemented, but inevitably the implementation expense and the time required to plan, approve, and build infrastructure can't keep pace with the population growth. There have been some improvements. [[Carpool lane]]s have become common in urban areas, which are intended to encourage people to drive together rather than in individual automobiles. [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] is gradually building a [[light rail]] system (often over routes of an original turn-of-the-century electric railroad line that was torn out and paved over to encourage the advent of the automobile age). None of the implemented solutions are without their critics. The sprawling nature of the Bay Area and of the Los Angeles Basin makes it difficult to build [[mass transit]] that can reach and serve a significant portion of the population.\n\nDuring the 1960s, under the aegis of Chief Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]], the California Supreme Court became more liberal and progressive. Traynor's term as Chief Justice (from 1964 to 1970) was marked by a number of firsts: California was the first state to create true [[strict liability]] in [[product liability]] cases, the first to allow the action of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] (NIED) even in the absence of physical injury to the plaintiff, and the first to allow bystanders to sue for NIED where the only physical injury was to a relative.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, California became a leader in [[family law]]. California was the first state to allow true [[no-fault divorce]], with the passage of the Family Law Act of 1969. In 1994, the Legislature took family law out of the Civil Code and created a new Family Code. In 2002, the Legislature granted registered domestic partners the same rights under state law as married spouses. In 2008 California became the second state to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] when the California Supreme Court ruled the ban unconstitutional.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the California Supreme Court has become more conservative, particularly with regard to the rights of criminal defendants. This is commonly seen as a reaction against the strict anti-[[death penalty]] stance of Chief Justice [[Rose Bird]] in the early 1980s, although the funding that eventually brought about her defeat was from corporate and business interests concerned with what they felt was an anti-business stance by the Chief Justice. The state's electorate responded by removing her (and two of her perceived liberal allies) from the court in November 1986.\n\n==High-tech expansion==\nStarting in the 1950s, high technology companies in [[Northern California]] began a spectacular growth that continued through the end of the 20th century. The major products included [[personal computer]]s, [[video game]]s, and [[Computer network|networking system]]s. The majority of these companies settled along a highway stretching from [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], notably including [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], all in the [[Santa Clara Valley]], the so-called \"[[Silicon Valley]]\", named after the material used to produce the [[integrated circuit]]s of the era.\n\nThis era peaked in 2000, by which time demand for skilled technical professionals had become so high that the high-tech industry had trouble filling all of its positions and therefore pushed for increased visa quotas so that they could recruit from overseas. When the \"[[Dot-com bubble]]\" burst in 2001, jobs evaporated overnight, and for the first time over the next two years more people moved out of the area than moved in. This somewhat mirrored the collapse of the [[aerospace industry]] in southern California some twenty years earlier.\n\n==2000\u2013present==\nAlthough air pollution problems have been reduced, health problems associated with pollution have continued. The brown haze known as \"[[smog]]\" has been substantially abated thanks to federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust.<ref>William Deverell, and Greg Hise, eds.

Krier, and Edmund Ursin, ''Pollution and Policy: A Case Essay on California and Federal Experience with Motor Vehicle Air Pollution, 1940\u20131975'' (1978)</ref>\n\nAn energy crisis in 2001 led to [[rolling blackout]]s, soaring power rates, and the importation of electricity from neighboring states. [[Southern California Edison]] and [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] came under heavy criticism.<ref>Severin Borenstein, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696582 \"The Trouble With Electricity Markets: Understanding California's Restructuring Disaster\"], ''Journal of Economic Perspectives,'' Winter 2002, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp. 191\u2013211 (in JSTOR)</ref>\n\n===Housing bubble bursts===\nThe ongoing demand for well-educated workers continued. Housing prices in urban areas continued to increase so that a modest home that in the 1960s cost $25,000, cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. [[Mortgage]] companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.<ref>Robert M. Hardaway, ''The Great American Housing Bubble: The Road to Collapse'' (2011) p. 22</ref><ref>Stephen D. Cummings and Patrick B. Reddy, ''California after Arnold'' (2009) p. 102</ref>\n\nIn the [[California gubernatorial election, 2002|2002 gubernatorial campaign]], Democratic incumbent [[Gray Davis]] defeated Republican challenger [[Bill Simon (politician)|Bill Simon]]. On October 7, 2003, Davis was [[recall election|recalled]], with 55.4% of the voters supporting the recall (see [[results of the 2003 California recall]]). With a plurality of 48.6% of the vote, Republican [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was chosen as the new governor. Lieutenant Governor [[Cruz Bustamante]] received 31.5% of the vote, and Republican state senator [[Tom McClintock]] received 13.5% of the vote.\n\nSchwarzenegger began his shortened term with a soaring approval rating and soon after began implementing a conservative agenda. This initially resulted in sparring with the heavily Democratic Assembly and Senate over the state budget, battles which provided his infamous \"girly men\" comment but also began taking their toll on his approval rating. Schwarzenegger then embarked on a campaign to enact several ballot propositions in a 2005 special election touted as reforming California's budget system, redistricting powers, and union political fundraising. The union-led campaign spearheaded by the [[California Nurses Association]] contributed heavily to the defeat of every proposition in the special election.\n\nSince this conspicuous failure, Schwarzenegger made a turn back to the left, criticizing the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] at many junctures, reviving his environmental agenda, and compromising with the legislature on the traditionally Democratic issue of education spending. His approval rating also revived, and he was re-elected in 2006. However, continued paralysis in state government and the inability of the legislature and governor to work out the fundamental funding questions resulted in voter disapproval of both the legislators and the governor, whose approval rating was among the lowest ever recorded pending the election of [[Jerry Brown]] in November 2010.\n\n===Religion===\nThe 2014 Pew Religious Landscape Survey showed the religious makeup of California as follows:<ref>Pew Research Center, [http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/california/ \"Religious Landscape Study: California\"]</ref>\n\n:Christian 63%\n::20% Evangelical Protestant\n::10% Mainline Protestant\n:: 2% Black Protestant\n::28% Catholic\n:: 4% Other Christian\n: Non-Christian faiths 9%\n: Unaffiliated 28%\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of California before 1900]]\n* [[History of California]]\n* [[History of Los Angeles]]\n* [[History of San Diego]]\n* [[History of San Francisco]]\n* [[History of the west coast of North America]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Scholarly surveys===\n* Aron, Stephen. \"Convergence, California and the Newest Western History,\" ''California History'' Volume: 86#4 September 2009. pp 4+ historiography.\n* Bakken, Gordon Morris.

The economy was widely based on specialty agriculture, oil, tourism, shipping, film, and after 1940 advanced technology such as aerospace and electronics industries \u2013 along with a significant military presence. The films and stars of [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] helped make the state the \"center\" of worldwide attention.

If it were an independent country, California would rank 34th in population in the world. California has had waves of immigration and emigration over the years. The first big wave was the [[California Gold Rush]] starting in 1848 of miners, businessmen, farmers, loggers, etc. as well as their many supporters.\n\nThere were fewer than 10,000 females in a total California population (not including [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who were not counted) of about 120,000 residents in 1850. About 3.0% of the gold rush Argonauts before 1850 were female or about 3,500 [[Women in the California Gold Rush|female Gold Rushers]], compared to about 115,000 male California Gold Rushers. Massive immigration from mostly other states continued throughout the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"dhs.gov\">U.S. Immigration Statistics yearbook; pg. 5 [https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2011/ois_yb_2011.pdf] accessed 11 Jan 2014</ref><ref>\"Historical Statistics of the United States, 1789\u20131945\"; [https://web.archive.org/web/20041229215830/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html] Accessed 14 Apr 2011</ref> California did not reach a \"normal\" male to female ratio of about one to one until the 1950 census. California for over a century was short on females.\n\nThe 1900 census showed emigrations down to \"only\" a 20% growth rate. The early 1900s showed a massive population increase of over 60% between 1900 and 1910. The population more than doubled again in the next 20 years by 1930. Foreign immigration largely ceased during the [[Great Depression]], as immigration to the United States was held to a low of 23,068 per year by 1933, and many foreign workers were deported. There were not enough jobs to go around. After [[World War II]] and the [[Great Depression]], there was a rapidly increasing buildup of United States workers in California as wartime industries boomed. Most of these workers were from other states as they settled in California and increased the California population to 10,586,223 by 1950. Immigration to the United States only started to increase significantly in 1946, when immigration to all of the United States was back up to 108,721 per year<ref name=\"dhs.gov\"/> The continuing prosperity and emigration from other states and immigration from other countries in the 1950s and 1970s almost doubled the California population again to 19,953,134 by 1970. The 1970\u20132010 population growth has still been substantial but has slowed to \"only\" about a 15% growth rate per decade. By 2010 the California population growth rate slowed slightly to 10%.\n\n==California earthquakes==\n{{See also|List of earthquakes in California}}\n\n[[Earthquake]]s in California are common occurrences since the state is traversed by six major [[strike-slip fault]] systems with hundreds of related faults, many of which are \"sister faults\" of the infamous [[San Andreas Fault]] that runs nearly the full length of California at the juncture of the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]]. The fault systems include the [[Hayward Fault Zone]], [[Calaveras Fault]], [[Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault]], and the [[San Gregorio Fault]]. Significant blind [[thrust fault]]s (faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures) are associated with portions of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] and the northern reaches of the [[Diablo Range]] and [[Mount Diablo]]. The [[California earthquake forecast]] gives a rough estimate of where the main earthquake zones in California are. Earthquake damage depends on what area is hit, how close to the surface the center of the earthquake is located, and its magnitude. Earthquake damage, for a given magnitude earthquake, to human structures depends on how well the buildings are built and what the structures are located on. Buildings on soft or filled-in soil suffer the most because they feel shock waves most strongly. Buildings on bedrock suffer less damage because the ground is firmer. Sometimes the ensuing fires, floods or [[tsunami]]s caused by the earthquake are often where the greatest damage occurs.\n\n[[File:Sfearthquake2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Stockton Street (San Francisco)|Stockton Street]] from [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], looking toward [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]]]]\n[[File:San Francisco Fire Sacramento Street 1906-04-18.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Arnold Genthe's [[Looking Down Sacramento Street, San Francisco, April 18, 1906|famous photograph]], looking toward the fire on Sacramento Street]]\n[[File:1906 Boatwright intensity.jpg|thumb|250px|The intensity of the earthquake]]\n\nThe '''[[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]''' struck the city (then the largest in California) and nearby communities at 5:12&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, April 18, 1906.<ref name=usgs>[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/1906/18april/index.php USGS \u2013 The Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake]</ref> Devastating fires broke out in the city that lasted for several days, destroying about 28,000 buildings.

Organized businessmen were the leaders of both of these reforms. The driving force for railroad regulation came less from an outraged public seeking lower rates than from shippers and merchants who wanted to stabilize their businesses. Public utility officers spearheaded campaigns for the passage, and later the enlargement of the Public Utilities Act. They expected that state regulation would reduce wasteful competition between their companies, improve the value of their companies' securities, and allow them to escape continual wrangling with county and municipal authorities.<ref name=\"in JSTOR\">Mansel G.

The most important progressive victories of 1921 were the passage of administrative reorganization laws, the King Bill, increasing corporate taxes, and a progressive budget. In 1927\u201331, governor [[Clement Calhoun Young]] (1869\u20131947) brought more progressivism to the state. The state began large-scale [[hydroelectric power]] development, and began state aid to the [[disability|handicapped]]. California became the first state to enact a modern old-age [[pension]] law.

Women's clubs flourished and turned a spotlight on issues such as [[state school|public schools]], dirt and [[pollution]], and [[public health]]. California women were leaders in the [[temperance movement]], moral reform, [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], public schools, [[recreation]], and other issues. They helped pass the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th amendment]], which established [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1920.

It was the only state where the Progressives took control of the Republican Party.\n\n===Lincoln\u2013Roosevelt League===\nCalifornia was a leader in the [[Progressive Movement]] from the 1890s into the 1920s. A coalition of reform-minded [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], especially in southern California, coalesced around [[Thomas Bard]] (1841\u20131915). Bard's election in 1899 as United States senator enabled the anti-[[political machine|machine]] Republicans to sustain a continuing opposition to the [[Southern Pacific Railway]]'s political power in California. They helped nominate [[George C. Pardee]] for governor in 1902 and formed the \"[[Lincoln\u2013Roosevelt League]]\". In 1910 [[Hiram W. Johnson]] won the campaign for governor under the slogan \"Kick the Southern Pacific out of politics.\" In 1912 Johnson became the running mate for [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on the new [[Bull Moose Party]] ticket.<ref>W.

Construction of transports and warships boosted the economy of the Bay area.\n\n==Organized labor==\nOrganized labor was centered in San Francisco for much of the state's early history. By the opening decades of the twentieth century, labor efforts had expanded to Los Angeles, Long Beach and the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. In 1901, the San Francisco-based [[City Front Federation]] was reputed to be the strongest trade federation in the country. It grew out of intense organizational drives in every trade during the boom around the start of the 20th century.\n\nEmployers also organized during the building trades strike of 1900 and the (San Francisco) City Front Federation strike of 1901, which led to the founding of the [[Building Trades Council]]. The [[open shop]] question was at stake. Out of the City Front strike came the [[Union Labor Party (California)|Union Labor Party]], because workers were angry at the mayor for using the [[San Francisco Police Department|police]] to protect strikebreakers. [[Eugene Schmitz]] was elected mayor in 1902 on the party's ticket, making San Francisco the only town in the United States, for a time, to be run by labor. A combination of [[political corruption|corruption]] and unscrupulous reformers culminated in [[graft (politics)|graft]] prosecutions in 1907.\n\nIn 1910, Los Angeles was still an open shop, and employers in the north threatened for a new push to open San Francisco shops. Responding, labor sent delegations south in June 1910. National organizers were sent in during a [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] of 1,200 idled metal-trades workers. Then occurred an incident that would set back Los Angeles organizing for years: on October 10, 1910, a bomb exploded at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper plant that killed 21 workers.\n\nIn the decade following, the rapid growth of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW, or Wobblies) in un-unionized trades, logging, wheat farming, and lumber camps began extending its efforts to mines, ports and agriculture. The IWW came to public notice after the [[Wheatland Hop Riot]], when a sheriff's posse broke up a protest meeting and four people died. It led to the first legislation protecting [[farmworker|field labor]]. The IWW was harmed by anti-union drives and prosecution of members under the [[California Criminal Syndicalism Act]].\n\nThe IWW was also involved in the 1923 seamen's strike at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], where [[Upton Sinclair]] was arrested for reciting the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. The man who became the most prominent Wobbly of all, [[Thomas Mooney]], soon became a ''cause-celebre'' of labor and the most important [[political prisoner]] in America.\n\n===Labor in the 1920s===\nThe [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] killed ten people and hurt labor for decades. During the 1920s, the open shop efforts succeeded through a coordinated strategy called the \"[[American Plan (union negotiations)|American Plan]]\". In one case, the Industrial Association of San Francisco raised over a million dollars to break the building trades strikes in 1921 that led to the collapse of the building trades unions. This [[Employers' organization|employers association]] cut wages twice in one year, and the Metal Trades Council was defeated, losing an agreement that had been in effect since 1907. The Seamen's Union also suffered defeat in 1921.\n\n===Labor in the 1930s===\n\n====Labor unions====\nUnions grew rapidly after 1935 with political and legal support from the national [[New Deal]] and its [[Wagner Act]] of 1935. The most serious strike came in 1934 along the state's ports. In May 1934, dock workers and [[longshoremen]] along the West Coast [[Strike action|went on strike]] for better hours and pay, a union hiring hall and a coast-wide contract. [[Communist party|Communists]] were in control of the union, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), led by [[Harry Bridges]] (1901\u20131990).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Robert W. Cherny, \"Prelude to the Popular Front: The Communist Party in California, 1931\u201335.\" ''American Communist History'' 2002 1(1): 5\u201342 online at [[EBSCO]]</ref>\n\nOn \"Bloody Thursday\", July 5, 1934, San Francisco was swept by bloody rioting. Striking maritime workers, pitting themselves against police, took control of much of the waterfront and warehouse areas of the city. Two workers were killed and hundreds were clubbed and gassed. The West Coast Waterfront Strike lasted 83 days, with longshoremen returning to work on July 31. [[Arbitration]] was agreed to, and it resulted in a victory for the strikers and the unionization of all West Coast ports in the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Lange-no-on-one-1938.jpg|thumb|[[Kern County, California|Kern County]], April 1938. An agricultural worker with union membership book and pin against the 1938 anti-picketing ballot. (Photo: Dorothea Lange)]]\n\nSan Francisco in the late 1930s had 120,000 union members. Longshoremen wore union buttons on their white union-made caps, [[Teamsters]] drove trucks as unionists, and fishermen, taxi drivers, streetcar conductors, motormen, newsboys, retail clerks, hotel employees, newspapermen and [[bootblack]]s all had representation. Against 30,000 trade union members in 1933\u201334, Los Angeles by the late thirties had 200,000, even against a severe 1938 anti-[[picketing]] ordinance. But Los Angeles became unionized in the mass production industries of aircraft, auto, rubber, and oil, and at the yards of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]]. Later, drives for unionization spread through musicians, teamsters, building trades, movies, actors, writers and directors.\n\n====Farm labor====\nFarm labor remained unorganized, the work brutal and underpaid. In the 1930s, 200,000 farm laborers traveled the state in tune with the seasons.{{fact|date=September 2019}} Unions were accused of an \"inland march\" against landowners' rights when they took up the early effort to organize farm labor. A number of valley towns endorsed anti-picketing ordinances to thwart organizing.\n\nIn the 1933\u20131934 period, a wave of agricultural strikes flooded the Central Valley, including the [[Imperial Valley]] lettuce strike and San Joaquin Valley cotton strike. In the 1936 [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] lettuce strike, [[vigilante]] violence shocked the nation. Again, in the spring of 1938, about three hundred men, women and children were driven by vigilantes from their homes in [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]] and [[Nevada City, California|Nevada City]].\n\nA 1938 ballot proposition against picketing, \"Proposition #1\", considered [[fascist]] by commentators for the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|state grange]], became a huge political struggle. Proposition #1 failed at the polls. Soon, [[racism|racist]] distinctions fell as California unions began to admit non-white members.\n\nBy the advent of [[World War II]], California had an old-age assistance law, [[unemployment compensation]], a 48-hour work week maximum for women, an [[apprentice]] law, and [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] rules.\n\n====Okies====\n\"[[Okie]]s\" were the 250,000 hard-luck migrants who fled the [[Dust Bowl]] and depression in [[Oklahoma]] and neighboring states in the 1930s in search of a better future. Many sought farm labor jobs advertised in the Central Valley. They were harshly disparaged at the time. Police were stationed at the [[Arizona]] line to keep them out, and the state legislature passed a law to keep them out, but it was overturned by the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref>Nancy J.

Gregory finds that most came from urban backgrounds, and one in six had been a [[white-collar worker]]. He notes that in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]],'' novelist [[John Steinbeck]] saw the migrants becoming active agitators for unions and the New Deal, demanding higher wages and better housing conditions. Steinbeck did not foresee that most Okies would move into well-paid jobs in war industries in the 1940s. The children and grandchildren of the Okies seldom returned to Oklahoma.

Beginning before 1900, California has built extensive water projects costing many billions of dollars to store and move water where it is needed. California water comes primarily from snowfall in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the northern part of the state during the relatively short winter from about October to March. The rest of the year typically has very little rainfall or snowfall. California weather is also prone to extended [[drought]]s that can last several years.

Starting in about 1901, [[San Francisco]] started looking for a new supply of municipal water. Following the disastrous [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and fire, this search intensified, and they finally chose the Tuolumne River as the \"best\" available water resource. The City and County of San Francisco bought most of the water rights to the Tuolumne River watershed in 1910. The Hetch Hetchy project centered on damming the main Tuolumne River as it meandered through Hetch Hetchy's wide glacial-cut valley. The river, with its source in a perpetual glacier on {{convert|13000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]], drains {{convert|650|mi2|km2}} of watershed of the rugged granite mountains sloping west from the Sierra Nevada crest. The Hetch Hetchy water system's goal was providing up to {{convert|400000000|gal|l}} of water per day to San Francisco and the growing [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Region]] and tap the [[hydroelectric]] power that would be generated by a dam and power stations. After a vigorous debate, the United States Congress passed the [[Raker Act]] in 1913 which authorized the building of dam(s), hydroelectricity plant and municipal water supply system inside part of Yosemite National Park. The act was signed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in February 1916.\n\nA key element of the plan was a new dam and reservoir in the Hetch Hetchy Valley, but access to the area was poor, so a railroad was planned to help build the dam. The steep terrain dictated a 4-degree roadbed, roughly twice as steep as a \"regular\" railroad. The steep grades dictated geared-down locomotives. The first {{convert|9|mi|0}} of the [[Hetch Hetchy Railroad]] (HHRR) were completed in 1915, and the remaining {{convert|59|mi}} were completed by October 1917. Construction costs for the HHRR were about US$3 million, far less than what the city might have paid contractors to transport workers, concrete and other materials for the dam over the rough and steep terrain by 12 mule train wagons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The president of the railroad was San Francisco Mayor James Rolph, and the vice president and general manager was the construction project's chief engineer [[Michael O'Shaughnessy]]. The Hetch Hetchy Railroad was begun as a connection of the [[Sierra Railway]] at Hetch Hetchy Junction, {{convert|15|mi}} west of [[Jamestown, California|Jamestown]], and extended another {{convert|68|mi}} to the Hetch Hetchy Dam (later named the [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|O'Shaughnessy Dam]] after the chief engineer) site for delivery of construction workers and materials.

Shasta Dam was first authorized in the 1930s as a state undertaking. However, this coincided with the [[Great Depression]], and building of the dam was transferred to the federal [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]] as a public works project. Construction started in earnest in 1937 under the supervision of Chief Engineer [[Frank Crowe]]. During its building, the dam provided thousands of much-needed jobs; it was finished 26 months ahead of schedule in 1945. When completed, the dam was the second-tallest in the United States after [[Hoover Dam|Hoover]], and was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of all time.\n\nEven before its dedication, Shasta Dam served an important role in [[World War II]], providing electricity to California factories, and it still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources. However, it has brought about major changes to the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River, and met with controversy over its significant destruction of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribal lands.

As a result, the project has only delivered an average of {{convert|2.4|e6acre.ft|km3}} annually, as compared to total entitlements of {{convert|4.23|e6acre.ft|km3}}. Environmental concerns caused by the dry-season removal of water from the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], a sensitive [[estuary]] region, have often led to further reductions in water delivery. Work continues today to expand the SWP's water delivery capacity while finding solutions for the environmental impacts of water diversion.\n\n[[File:Parker Dam.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Parker Dam]] on [[Lake Havasu]], where [[Colorado River]] waters are initially drawn into the [[Colorado River Aqueduct]] water distribution system]]\n\nThe '''[[Colorado River Aqueduct]]''', or '''CRA''', is a {{convert|242|mi|adj=on}} water conveyance in Southern California, operated by the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]] (MWD). The aqueduct impounds water from the [[Colorado River]] at [[Lake Havasu]] on the California\u2013[[Arizona]] border. This water is then transferred west by pumping stations, reservoirs, and canals across the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] and [[Colorado Desert|Colorado]] deserts to the east side of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]]. It is one of the primary sources of [[drinking water]] for Southern California.\n\nOriginally conceived by [[William Mulholland]] and designed by Chief Engineer Frank E. Weymouth of the MWD, it was the largest public works project in southern California during the [[Great Depression]]. The project employed 30,000 people over an eight-year period and as many as 10,000 at one time.<ref name='kysq'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kysq.org/docs/WPEE_CRA.pdf | title = Colorado River Aqueduct | accessdate = 2010-11-20 | last = Zetland | first = David | date = August 5, 2009 | work = kysq.org | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010805/http://www.kysq.org/docs/WPEE_CRA.pdf | archive-date = July 27, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe system is composed of two reservoirs, five pumping stations, {{convert|63|mi}} of canals, {{convert|92|mi}} of tunnels, and {{convert|84|mi}} of buried conduit and siphons. Average annual throughput is {{convert|1200000|acre.ft|km3}}.<ref name='kysq' />\n\n[[File:Davis Dam 2.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Davis Dam]] on the Colorado River]]\n\n'''[[Davis Dam]]''' is located on the Colorado River about {{convert|70|mi}} downstream from [[Hoover Dam]]. Davis Dam stretches across the border between [[Arizona]] and [[Nevada]] and impounds the Colorado River to form [[Lake Mohave]]. The [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] owns and operates the dam, which was completed in 1951. Davis Dam is a zoned [[earth fill]] dam with a [[concrete]] spillway, {{convert|1600|ft}} in length at the crest, and {{convert|200|ft}} high. The earth fill dam begins on the Nevada side, but it does not extend to the Arizona side. Instead, there is an inlet formed by earth and concrete. At the end of the inlet is the [[spillway]]. The [[power plant]] is on the Arizona side of the inlet, perpendicular to the dam. This is a very unusual design. The [[hydroelectric]] plant generates between 1 and 2 [[watt-hour|terawatt-hours]] of electricity annually. The plant has a capacity of {{convert|251|MW|abbr=on|lk=on}}, and the tops of its five [[Francis turbine]]s are visible from outside the plant. The plant's [[hydraulic head]] is {{convert|136|ft}}. The dam's purpose is to generate hydroelectricity and regulate water releases into the Colorado River for use downstream by California, Arizona and [[Mexico]].\n\n[[File:Imperial Dam.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Imperial Dam]] on the Colorado River at the head of the [[All-American Canal]]]]\n\n'''[[Imperial Dam]]''' is a [[Arch dam|concrete slab and buttress]], [[dam#Spillways|ogee weir]] structure across the [[Colorado River]] on the California\u2013Arizona border, {{convert|18|mi}} northeast of [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]]. Completed in the 1938, the dam retains the waters of the Colorado River in the [[Imperial Reservoir]] before desilting and diversion into the [[All-American Canal]], the [[Gila River]], and the [[Yuma Project]] aqueduct. Between 1932 and 1940, the [[Imperial Irrigation District]] relied on the Inter-California Canal, the [[Alamo Canal|Imperial Canal]], and the [[Alamo River]].\n\nImperial Dam was built to replace the Laguna Diversion Dam, built in 1901\u20131915, which was the first dam and reclamation project on the Colorado River. Imperial Dam was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and 72 {{convert|770|ft|adj=on}} scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six sludge pipes running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California sluiceway, which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this location. Diversions can top {{convert|40000|cuft}} per second\u2014more than 50 times the flow of the [[Rio Grande]].\n\nThe Gila River and the Yuma Project aqueduct branch off toward Arizona, while the All-American Canal branches southwards for {{convert|37|mi}} before reaching its headworks on the California border and bending west toward the [[Imperial Valley]].\n[[File:All-American 2009.jpg|thumb|260px|View of the {{convert|15|km|mi|order=flip}} [[Coachella Canal]] (part of the [[All-American Canal]]) just west of [[Yuma, Arizona]]; north is to the upper right.]]\n\nThe '''All-American Canal''' is an {{convert|80|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} aqueduct in southeastern California. It conveys water from the [[Colorado River]] into the [[Imperial Valley]] and to nine cities. It is the Imperial Valley's only water source, and replaced the [[Alamo Canal]], which was located mostly in Mexico. The [[Imperial Dam]], about {{convert|30|mi}} northeast of [[Yuma, Arizona]], on the Colorado River, diverts water into the All-American Canal, which runs to just west of [[Calexico, California]], before its last branch heads mostly north into the Imperial Valley. Five smaller canals branching off the All-American Canal move water into the Imperial Valley. These canal systems irrigate up to {{convert|630000|acre|ha}} of good cropland and have made possible a greatly increased crop yield in this area, originally one of the driest on earth. It is the largest irrigation canal in the world, carrying a maximum of {{convert|26155|cuft/s|m3/s}}. [[Surface runoff|Agricultural runoff]] from the All-American Canal drains into the [[Salton Sea]]. The All-American Canal runs parallel to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] for several miles.\n\nThe '''[[Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel]]''' (also known as the \"Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel\" or \"SRDWSC\") is a [[canal]] from the [[Port of Sacramento]] to the [[Sacramento River]], which flows into [[San Francisco Bay]]. It was completed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1963. The channel is about {{convert|30|ft}} deep, {{convert|200|ft}} wide, and {{convert|43|mi}} long.\n\nThe Port of Sacramento has always been a significant port on the [[West Coast of the United States]] since the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]]. It was originally served primarily by [[paddle steamer]]s which carried cargo from San Francisco Bay up the Sacramento River to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. Today it receives far less traffic than larger ports and handles primarily agricultural products and other bulk goods rather than [[containerization|containers]], which now dominate the shipping market.\n\nOther engineering feats were the building of [[Hoover Dam]], which though in Nevada, provides power and water to Southern California.\n\nAnother project was the draining of [[Tulare Lake]], which during high water was the largest freshwater lake fully inside an American state. This created a large wet area amid the dry [[San Joaquin Valley]], and swamps abounded at its shores. By the 1970s, it was completely drained, but it attempts to resurrect itself during heavy rains.\n\n===Water recycling===\nThe recycling of treated municipal wastewater has become a significant part of California's water supply. The different water agencies in California were recycling over {{convert|770000|acre.ft|m3}} as of 2009, the date of the last survey. Some of the many uses for recycled water are: golf course irrigation 7%, landscape irrigation 17%, agricultural irrigation 37%, commercial reuse of water 7%, industrial uses 7%, geothermal energy production 1%, seawater intrusion barrier via fresh water injections 7%, groundwater recharge by well injection and flotation ponds 12%, recreational impoundments 4%, and natural wetland systems/restoration 4%.<ref>[http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/grants_loans/water_recycling/munirec.shtml California Municipal Wastewater Recycling Survey-2009]. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> The stated goal is the recycling of {{convert|1600000|acre.ft|m3}} of treated municipal wastewater.\n\nOn March 14, 2014, the State Water Board approved $800 million in financial incentives for recycled water projects.<ref>[http://ca.gov/drought/story-1.html Water Recycling Funding Program]. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> These projects typically take years to get approved and built.\n\nThe '''Water Replenishment District of Southern California''' ('''WRD'''), in service since 1959, is one of the more aggressive agencies that use recycled water for their groundwater replenishment and seawater intrusion barriers.<ref>[http://www.wrd.org/ Water Replenishment District]. Accessed 3 April 2014</ref> To prevent seawater contamination of their groundwater, they have several sets of [[injection well]]s that inject clean water between their [[aquifer]] and the sea. This creates a local water barrier to seawater intrusion. The other mechanism is to make sure the water level is above sea level.\n\nWell users, including municipal water users, in the WRD area pump about {{convert|250000|acre.ft|m3}} of water per year out of their aquifer. This is an \"overdraft\" of about {{convert|150000|acre.ft|m3}} of water over what their underground aquifer can \"normally\" refill. To replace this \"overdraft\" of water into the aquifer, they have flotation ponds that catch rain runoff water, and supplement with other water they either buy or recycle, then let the water soak into the ground (spreading water) to help replenish the water in the aquifer(s). In addition they buy [[Colorado River]] water that is shipped via the [[Colorado River Aqueduct]], and they accept part of the treated municipal wastewater of the about 4,000,000 people in their district and treat it to additional purity and sanitation levels by using [[reverse osmosis]] and advanced filtering. Their largest [[sewage treatment#tertiary treatment|tertiary water treatment]] facility is the Leo J. Vander Lans Advanced Water Treatment facility. The water out of this facility is better than the water that comes out of the \"average\" municipal water treatment facility.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} To finance their water recycling projects WRD charges $268 per acre-foot of water pumped out, which generates about $65,000,000/year.<ref>[http://www.wrd.org/March_2014_ESR.pdf WRD engineering report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401142909/http://www.wrd.org/March_2014_ESR.pdf |date=2014-04-01 }}. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> WRD is now on a project (WIN) to enlarge their water treatment facilities to take larger quantities of treated municipal wastewater and treat enough of it that they will not have to buy Colorado River water. Overall it is estimated that this project provides over 40% of the water used in the Southern California district served by the WRD.\n\nAmong the many water recycling projects just being completed, the South Bay Water Recycling program distributes recycled water to more than 400 customers in the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], area for irrigation, industrial and other purposes. In Northern California, two agencies have teamed up to develop the San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Program. Jointly sponsored by the Dublin San Ramon Services District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the program will provide recycled water to municipal parks, golf courses, business parks, greenbelts and roadways. The Irvine Ranch Water District has built a dual water system, which supplies recycled water to commercial high rises for use in flushing toilets and urinals. A West Basin Municipal Water District project distributes recycled water to more than 85 customers, including [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and [[Mobil]] refineries. Monterey County Water Recycling Projects provide recycled water for agricultural irrigation to help ease demands on an overused groundwater aquifer. The Padre Dam Water Recycling Facility was expanded to recycle 2 million gallons/day for turf irrigation at parks, golf courses and other commercial and industrial facilities.\n\nIn the [[San Diego]] region, 16 water agencies are planning to use over {{convert|32300|acre.ft|m3}} of recycled water per year in order to meet the region's water supply demand. The city of [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad's]] new recycled water treatment and distribution system will deliver approximately {{convert|3000|acre.ft|m3}}} per year of recycled water to customers located in that community. In the southern portion of [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], the Otay Water District is constructing a distribution system to deliver an estimated {{convert|5000|acre.ft|m3}} per year of recycled water by 2030 purchased from the city of San Diego's South Bay Water Recycling Plant. In Southern California, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District is using recycled water to help replenish and enhance [[Lake Elsinore]].\n\nThe Orange County Sanitation and Orange County Water Districts are planning for treated wastewater, currently discharged into the ocean, to undergo [[microfiltration]], [[reverse osmosis]] and [[ultraviolet disinfection]]. The purified water will be equivalent in quality to distilled water and exceed all state and federal drinking water standards. The purified water will be pumped to spreading ponds near the [[Santa Ana River]] for [[percolation]] into the groundwater basin, with some injected through injection wells along the coast as a barrier to seawater intrusion. Like the WRD projects in Southern California, the Orange County Water District has amassed a long record of successfully recycling water with its Water Factory 21.<ref>[http://www.ocwd.com/About/HistoricalInformation.aspx Water Factory 21]. Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref>\n\n===Desalination projects===\nOn December 24, 2012, the San Diego County Water Authority announced they had sold $734 million worth of tax-free bonds at 4.38% interest to build the Carlsbad Seawater Desalination Project, the largest seawater [[desalination]] plant in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The project is located near the Encina Power Station in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], and is expected to produce about {{convert|56000|acre.ft|m3}} of water per year by 2016 when the project is completed. The plant is expected to use over 17,000 reverse osmosis racks. The project includes $80 million in San Diego Water Authority upgrades to its own facilities. A {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} pipeline is being built to deliver desalinated water into its Twin Oaks Valley Water Treatment Plant near [[San Marcos, California|San Marcos]]. The developer Poseidon Resources is building the plant and pipeline in a [[joint venture]] with contractor Kiewit Shea Desalination. The project will deliver up to 50 million gallons a day of drought-proof, highly reliable water that will become a core, day-to-day resource for the region. It is projected to meet about 7% of San Diego County's demand in 2020. The total cost is projected at $1,849 to $2,257 per acre-foot.<ref>[http://www.sdcwa.org/734-million-carlsbad-desalination-project-financing-closes-0 Carlsbad Desalination Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082902/http://www.sdcwa.org/734-million-carlsbad-desalination-project-financing-closes-0 |date=2014-04-07 }}.

Accessed 3 Apr 2014</ref> The additional cost of desalinating seawater will add $5 to $7 per month to ratepayers' bills\u2014about a 10% increase.\n\nThe present (2014) drought has brought reconsideration of the Charles Meyer Desalination Facility that was built for $34 million in the early 1990s in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] but was later essentially mothballed when the drought was over. There are early discussions about investing around $20 million more to upgrade and restart the desalination plant. They have permits to make about {{convert|3000|acre.ft|m3}} of desalinated water per year, but they will incur additional costs to pump their desalinated water to existing higher elevation reservoirs if they reactivate the plant. The projected costs (2014) were about $3,000 per acre foot.\n\nThe small city of [[Sand City, California|Sand City]], located on the [[Monterey Peninsula]], struck out on its own in 2007 to develop a small desalination plant. The city partnered with California American Water for the $14 million project, which started producing 300 acre feet of freshwater a year in 2010. The cost and water are shared with other nearby small communities.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/california-drought/parched-california-pours-mega-millions-desalination-tech-n28066 California desalination plans].

Before that nearly all long distance travel was by railroad or stagecoach, with horse- or mule-drawn wagons hauling the freight. A key route was the [[Lincoln Highway]], which was America's first transcontinental road for motorized vehicles, connecting [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]]. The creation of the Lincoln Highway in 1913 was a major stimulus on the development of both industry and tourism in the state. Similar effects occurred in 1926 with the creation of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. The last large addition to the state highway system was made by the [[California State Assembly]] in 1959, after which only minor changes have been made. Most new highway construction was then done on the [[Interstate Highway System]] started under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who championed its formation.\n\nThe first state road was authorized on March 26, 1895, when a law created the post of \"[[Lake Tahoe]] Wagon Road Commissioner\" to maintain the [[Lake Tahoe Wagon Road]] (the 1852 [[Johnson's Cut-off]] of the [[California Trail]]), now [[U.S. Route 50 in California|US 50]] from [[Smith Flat, California|Smith Flat]], {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of [[Placerville, California|Placerville]], to the [[Nevada]] state line.<ref>\"An act to authorize the state of California to secure the title to and right of way for that certain wagon-road...commencing a short distance easterly from the village of Smith's Flat...and running thence to Lake Tahoe...\", approved March 26, 1895, chapter 128, p. 119 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uzoIUIQbCdgC&pg=RA11-PA25-IA4 Report of the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road Commissioner], November 29, 1898</ref> The {{convert|58|mi|adj=on}} road had been operated as a privately owned [[toll road]] from about 1855 till 1886, when [[El Dorado County, California|El Dorado County]] bought it; the county [[deed]]ed the road to the state on February 28, 1896.<ref name=centennial>[[California Highways and Public Works]], ''Centennial Edition'', September 9, 1950</ref> Funding initially was only enough for minimal improvements, including a [[bridge|stone bridge]] over the [[South Fork American River]] in 1901.<ref>Department of Engineering (1917), p. 181</ref>\n\n[[File:California Bureau of Highways 1896.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Bureau of Highways with their [[buckboard wagon]] in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], 1896]]\n\nAlso in 1895, on March 27 the legislature created the three-person [[Bureau of Highways (California)|Bureau of Highways]] to coordinate efforts by the [[list of counties in California|counties]] to build [[good roads]].

The Lincoln Highway when it was set up in 1913 used the [[Lake Tahoe Wagon Road]] (the 1852 [[Johnson's Cut-off]] of the [[California Trail]]), now [[U.S. Route 50 in California|US 50]], to get over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n\n[[File:Ridge Route ca 1920 2.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[Ridge Route]], ca. 1920]]\n\nSeveral more state highways were legislated in the next decade, and the legislature passed a law creating the [[California Department of Transportation|Department of Engineering]] on March 11, 1907. This new department, in addition to non-highway duties, was to maintain all state highways, including the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road.<ref name=1907-183>\"An act to create for the State of California a department of engineering...\", approved March 11, 1907, chapter 183, p. 215</ref> On March 22, 1909, the \"State Highways Act\" was passed, taking effect on December 31, 1910, after a successful vote by the people of the state in November.

The enormous variety in terrain and the year-round sunshine made filmmaking easier and cheaper, and actors, producers, financiers and craftsmen headed to Hollywood.\n\nThe movies made California even better known, attracting hundreds of thousands of migrants, especially from the [[Midwest]], who loved the mild [[Mediterranean climate]], cheap land, and new jobs.\n\nBy the 1930s, Hollywood had extended its reach into radio, and by 1950 Southern California had also become a major center of television production, hosting studios for major networks such as [[NBC]] and [[CBS]].\n\n==California aerospace and shipping==\n\n===California aerospace history===\nIn 1883\u20131886, [[John J.

Curtiss]] wrote to Secretary of the Navy [[George von L. Meyer]] offering flight instruction without charge for one [[United States Navy|Navy]] officer as one means of assisting \"in developing the adaptability of the aeroplane to military purposes.\" In the winter of 1910, Glenn Curtiss established a private flying school on North Island, on land obtained through the cooperation of the Aero Club of [[San Diego]]. He soon invited the [[United States Army|Army]] and Navy to send officers to receive free instruction as \"aeroplane pilots\". On December 23, 1910, Lieut. T. Gordon \"Spuds\" Ellyson was ordered to report to the Glenn Curtiss Aviation Camp at North Island in San Diego. He completed his training April 12, 1911, and became Naval Aviator No. 1. The original site of this winter encampment is now part of [[Naval Air Station North Island]] in San Diego and is referred to by the Navy as \"The Birthplace of Naval Aviation\".\n\nOn January 18, 1911, at 11:01&nbsp;a.m., [[Eugene Ely]], flying a Curtiss pusher, landed on a specially built platform aboard the armored cruiser [[USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4)|USS ''Pennsylvania'']] at anchor in San Francisco Bay.

In 1925, aircraft builder [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]] and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' publisher [[Harry Chandler]] worked together with Caltech president [[Robert Millikan]] to bring a state-of-the-art aeronautical research laboratory to the Pasadena college. Douglas recruited some of Caltech's best and brightest students for his company. Douglas utilized the lab's [[wind tunnel]] and research staff while designing his [[DC-1]], [[DC-2|2]], and [[DC-3|3]]. In this way, the DC-3, undoubtedly one of the most successful aircraft designs ever built, represented more than just a single designer's project. It was a regional product, the result of an alliance of business and science created over the preceding five decades.\n\nThe Caltech [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) traces its beginnings to 1936 in the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT), when the first set of rocket experiments were carried out in the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]]. Caltech graduate students [[Frank Malina]], Weld Arnold, [[Apollo M. O. Smith]], and [[Tsien Hsue-shen]], along with [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]] and Edward S. Forman, tested a small, alcohol-fueled motor to gather data for Malina's graduate thesis. Malina's thesis adviser was engineer-aerodynamicist [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], who eventually arranged for United States Army financial support for this \"GALCIT Rocket Project\" in 1939. In 1941, Malina, Parsons, Forman, [[Martin Summerfield]], and pilot Homer Bushey demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff rockets ([[JATO]] units) to the Army.  In 1943, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Malina, Parsons, and Forman established the Aerojet Corporation to manufacture JATO motors. The project took on the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory in November 1943, formally becoming an Army facility operated under contract by the university.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early Years | url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/settingstakes.php | publisher=JPL}}</ref><ref name=\"Koppes\">{{cite web | first=Clayton | last=Koppes | title=JPL and the American Space Program | location=New Haven | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | year=1982}}</ref><ref name=Conway>{{cite web | first=Erik M. | last=Conway | title=From Rockets to Spacecraft: Making JPL a Place for Planetary Science | work=Engineering and Science | volume = 30 | issue=4 | pages=2\u201310 | url=http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/ESarchive-frame.html}}</ref><ref name=\"High Frontier\">{{cite book | last=Launius | first=Roger | title=To Reach High Frontier, A History of U.S. Launch Vehicles | year=2002 | publisher=[[University of Kentucky]] | isbn=978-0-8131-2721-7 | pages=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\nDuring JPL's Army years, the laboratory developed two deployed weapon systems, the [[MGM-5 Corporal]] and [[MGM-29 Sergeant]] intermediate range [[ballistic missile]]s, the first US ballistic missiles developed at JPL.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Keymeulen, Didier |author2=Myers, John |author3=Newton, Jason |author4=Csaszar, Ambrus |author5=Gan, Quan |author6=Hidalgo, Tim |author7=Moore, Jeff |author8=Sandoval, Steven |author9=Xu, Jiajing |author10=Schon, Aaron |author11=Assad, Chris |author12=Stoica, Adrian | title=Humanoids for Lunar and Planetary Surface Operations | hdl=2014/39699 | work=Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], 2006 | publisher=JPL TRS 1992+ }}</ref> It also developed a number of other weapons system prototypes, such as the [[Loki (rocket)|Loki]] anti-aircraft missile system, and the forerunner of the [[Aerobee]] sounding rocket.

Numerous air-training bases were established in Southern California, where most aircraft manufacturers, including [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Hughes Aircraft]], expanded or established factories. Major [[United States Navy|naval]] shipyards were established or expanded in San Diego, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], and [[Mare Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\n===California shipping===\n{{Further|Maritime history of California}}\n\n====Kaiser\u2013Permanente California shipyards====\n[[File:SS John W Brown.jpg|thumb|right|300px|{{SS|John W. Brown}} is one of only two surviving operational [[Liberty ship]]s.]]\n{{Further|Richmond Shipyards}}\n\nThe four [[Richmond Shipyards]], located in the city of [[Richmond, California]], were run by [[Permanente Metals]] and [[Kaiser Shipyards]]. The Richmond yards were responsible for constructing more [[Liberty ship]]s during World War II (747) than any other shipyard in the United States. Liberty ships were chosen for mass production because their somewhat obsolete design was relatively simple and their triple expansion piston [[steam engine]] components were simple enough that they could be made by several companies that were not highly needed to manufacture other parts. Ship building was given a high priority for steel and other needed components, as the German [[U-boat]]s until 1944 sunk more ships than could be built by all the shipyards in the United States. The United States shipyards built about 5,926 ships in World War II<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/merchantships.htm#MERCHANT_SHIP_CONSTRUCTION_IN_WWII Ships built in U.S. in WW-II] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125224039/http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/merchantships.htm#MERCHANT_SHIP_CONSTRUCTION_IN_WWII |date=2013-11-25 }} Accessed 12 February 2012</ref> plus over 100,000 more smallcraft made for the [[List of ships of the United States Army|U.S. Army naval components]].\n\n[[Henry J. Kaiser]]'s company had been building [[cargo ship]]s for the [[U.S. Maritime Commission]] in the late 1930s. In 1940 orders for ships from the British government, already at war with [[Nazi Germany]], allowed for growth. Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard beginning in December 1940, eventually building three more in Richmond; each yard with four to eight slips to build ships. Kaiser-Permanente specialized in mass-producing Liberty ships quickly and efficiently, and that was all they built until 1944, when they switched to the much more complicated [[Victory ship]]s and built some [[tug]]s and [[Landing Ship, Tank]] (LSTs) and other specialized ships in the newly built Yard #4.\n\n747 EC2-S-C1 Liberty ship cargo transports were built. The following references list individual ships built:\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #1; Oceans, Libertys, Victorys; built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #1 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #2; Libertys, Victorys built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #2 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #3; Libertys, Victorys; built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #3 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser Permanente Yard #4; [[Landing Ship, Tank]]s (LST)s, Tugs; built in Richmond<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kperm1.htm Kaiser Permanente Yard #4 Richmond, California] Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\n*Kaiser, California Shipbuilding; Libertys, Victorys; built in Los Angeles<ref>[http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kcalifornia.htm Kaiser, California Shipbuilding Los Angeles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510113117/http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/kcalifornia.htm |date=2012-05-10 }} Accessed 8 February 2012</ref>\t\n\nThese Liberty ships were completed in two-thirds the amount of time and at a quarter of the cost of the average of all other shipyards. The Liberty ship {{SS|Robert E. Peary}} was assembled in less than five days as a part of a special competition among shipyards; but by 1944 it was only taking the astonishingly brief time of a little over two weeks to assemble a Liberty ship by standard methods. They pre-assembled major parts of the ship including the hull sections at various locations in the shipyard and then, when needed, moved them with heavy lift cranes to the shipyard launching site, where they welded the pre-built sections together. After the ships were launched they were finished to their final configuration while afloat, and the launchway was available to start building another ship.\n\nIn 1945, the shipyards were shut down as quickly as they had started up four years earlier. Much of the shoreline previously occupied by the shipyards is now owned by the city of Richmond and has been cleaned up and redeveloped under federally assisted \"[[brownfields]]\" programs. The [[Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park]] was established on the shipyard site to commemorate and interpret the role of the home front in winning World War II.\n\n* Richmond Shipyards Images<ref>Richmond Shipyards Images [http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/browse/azBrowse/Richmond+Shipyards Images and oral history transcripts describing the early days of the Richmond Shipyards] Accessed 13 June 2011</ref><ref>Kaiser Permanente Shipyard building etc.[http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/kaiser-richmond_1.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829051031/http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/Kaiser-Richmond_1.htm |date=2013-08-29 }} Accessed 12 February 2012</ref>\n*Map of Kaiser-Permanente Yard #1, #2, #3 and #4<ref>Map of Kaiser-Permanente Yard #1, #2 [http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/kaiser-richmond_15a.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213020601/http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/kaiser-richmond_15a.htm |date=2012-02-13 }} Accessed 12 February 2012</ref>\n* Kaiser Shipyards<ref>Kaiser Shipyards [http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/Kaiser-Richmond_1.htm Permanente Metals Corporation \u2013 Kaiser Richmond CA Shipyards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829051031/http://www.sanpedro.com/Kaiser_Richmond/Kaiser-Richmond_1.htm |date=2013-08-29 }} 13 June 2011</ref>\n\n====California Shipbuilding Corporation====\n[[File:RedOakVictory2010Aug19.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Victory ship]] [[SS Red Oak Victory|SS ''Red Oak Victory'' (AK-235)]], now a museum ship]]\n{{Further|California Shipbuilding Corporation}}\n[[California Shipbuilding Corporation]] (often called Calship) built 467 [[Liberty ship|Liberty]] and [[Victory ship]]s during World War II, including [[Haskell-class attack transport|''Haskell''-class]] [[attack transport]]s.

After the war, it was liquidated.

The [[Napa River]] forms the eastern side of the island as the river enters the [[Carquinez Strait]] at its juncture with the east side of [[San Pablo Bay]]. In 1850, Commodore [[John Drake Sloat]], in charge of a commission to find a California naval base, recommended the island across the Napa River from the settlement of Vallejo, it being \"free from ocean gales and from floods and freshets.\"\n\nOn November 6, 1850, two months after California was admitted to statehood, President [[Millard Fillmore]] reserved Mare Island for government use. The United States Navy Department acted favorably on Commodore Sloat's recommendations, and Mare Island was purchased in July 1852, for the sum of $83,410, for the use as a naval shipyard. Two years later, on September 16, 1854, Mare Island became the first permanent United States naval installation on the West Coast, with Commodore [[David G. Farragut]] as Mare Island's first base commander. For more than a century, Mare Island served as the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]]. A {{convert|508|ft|adj=on}} [[drydock]] was built by the Public Works Department on an excellent rock foundation of cut granite blocks. The work took nineteen years and was completed in 1891. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], a concrete drydock on wooden piles, {{convert|740|ft}} long, was completed after eleven years of work, in 1910. By 1941, a third drydock had been completed, and drydock number four was under construction. The ammunitions depot and submarine repair base were modern, fireproof buildings. A million-dollar, three-way vehicle [[causeway]] to Vallejo was completed.\n\nBefore World War II, Mare Island had been in a continual state of upbuilding. By 1941, new projects included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large [[foundry]], [[machine shop]], [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several finger piers had recently{{when|date=October 2015}} been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} and one {{convert|750|ft|adj=on}} berth. It employed 5,593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 busily engaged by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3,500,000 (1941). Then came the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital carried 584 bed patients. Mare Island became one of the Navy's shipbuilding sites in World War II specializing in building [[diesel engine]]-powered [[submarine]]s; they eventually built 32 of them. After the war was over, Mare Island became a premier site for building [[nuclear-powered submarine]]s, building 27 of them.\n\nIn 1969, the Navy transferred its (Vietnam War) Brown Water Navy Riverine Training Forces from [[Coronado, California]], to Mare Island. Swift Boats (Patrol Craft Fast-PCF), and PBRs (Patrol Boat River), among other types of riverine craft, conducted boat operations throughout the currently named Napa-Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, which are located on the north and west portions of Mare Island. Mare Island Naval Base was deactivated during the 1995 cycle of US base closures, but the US Navy Reserves still have access to the water portions of the State Wildlife Area for any riverine warfare training being conducted from their new base in Sacramento.\n\nIn 1996 Mare Island Naval Shipyard was closed.\n\n===Naval Base San Diego===\n[[File:San Diego Naval Base.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aerial view of Naval Base San Diego]]\n{{Further|Naval Base San Diego}}\n\n[[Naval Base San Diego]] was started on land acquired in 1920. It is the largest base of the [[United States Navy]] on the west coast of the United States. Naval Base San Diego is the principal homeport of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], consisting of 54 ships and over 120 tenant commands. The base is composed of 13 piers stretched over {{convert|977|acres|sqkm}} of land and {{convert|326|acres|sqkm}} of water. The total on-base population is 20,000 military personnel and 6,000 civilians. San Diego has become the home port of the largest naval fleet in the world, and includes two [[supercarrier]]s, as well as [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] stations, United States Navy ports, and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] installations.\n\n==Growth after World War II==\nAfter the war, hundreds of land developers bought land cheap, subdivided it, built on it, and got rich. [[Real estate development]] replaced oil and agriculture as Southern California's principal industry. In 1955, [[Disneyland]] opened in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. In 1958, [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] left New York City and came to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The population of California expanded dramatically, to nearly 20 million by 1970.\n\nIn the late 1960s the [[baby boomer|baby-boom generation]] reached draft age, and many risked arrest to oppose the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. There were numerous demonstrations and strikes, most famously on the prestigious [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley campus]] of the [[University of California]], across the bay from San Francisco. In 1965, [[race riot]]s [[Watts riots|erupted in Watts]], in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central area]] of Los Angeles. The hippie riots on the [[Sunset Strip]] in Los Angeles were immortalized by [[Buffalo Springfield]] in the song \"[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]\" (1966). Some commentators predicted revolution. Then the federal government promised to withdraw from the Vietnam War, which at last happened in 1974. The radical political movements, having achieved a large part of their aim, lost members and funding.\n\nCalifornia still was a land of free spirits, open hearts, and easy-going living. Popular music of the period bore titles such as \"[[California Girls]],\" \"[[California Dreamin']],\" \"[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]],\" \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\". These reflected the Californian promise of easy living in a paradisaical climate. The [[surfing culture]] burgeoned. Many people took [[low-paying job]]s and joined the surfers living in trailers at the beach, and many others forsook ambition and joined the [[hippie]]s living in cities.\n\nThe most famous hippie hangout was the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district of San Francisco. The state's cities, especially San Francisco, became famous for their gentility and tolerance. A distinctive and idyllic Californian culture emerged for a time. The peak of this culture, in 1967, was known as the [[Summer of Love]]. California became known elsewhere in the United States often derogatorily, as the \"land of fruits and nuts\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==California as an economic powerhouse==\nConversely, during the same period, the Golden State also attracted commercial and industrial expansion at astronomical rates. The adoption of a [[California Master Plan for Higher Education|Master Plan for Higher Education]] in 1960 allowed the development of a highly efficient system of public higher education in the [[community college]]s and the [[University of California]] and [[California State University]] systems; by creating an educated workforce, it attracted investment, particularly in areas related to [[high tech]]nology. By 1980, California became recognized as the world's eighth-largest economy. Millions of workers were needed to fuel the expansion. The high population of the time caused tremendous problems with urban sprawl, traffic, pollution, and, to a lesser extent, crime.\n\n[[Urban sprawl]] created a backlash in many areas, with local governments limiting growth beyond certain boundaries, reducing lot sizes for building homes, and so on. [[Urban open space|Open space districts]] were created in several parts of the state specifically to obtain, manage, and preserve undeveloped land. For example, in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the open space districts have created a nearly contiguous range of permanently undeveloped land running through the coastal range and hills surrounding the Bay's urban valleys, enabling the creation of huge natural parks and envisioning a hiking trail that will eventually circumnavigate the Bay in an unbroken loop.\n\nThe immense problem with [[air pollution]] ([[smog]]) that had developed by the early 1970s also caused a backlash. With schools being closed routinely in urban areas for \"smog days\" when the [[ozone]] levels became too unhealthy and the hills surrounding urban areas seldom visible even within a mile, Californians were ready for changes. Over the next three decades, California enacted some of the strictest anti-smog regulations in the United States and has been a leader in encouraging nonpolluting strategies for various industries, including automobiles. For example, [[carpool lane]]s normally allow only vehicles with two/three or more occupants (whether the base number is two or three depends on what freeway you are on), but [[electric car]]s can use the lanes with only a single occupant. As a result, smog is significantly reduced from its peak, although local [[Environmental engineering|Air Quality Management]] Districts still monitor the air and generally encourage people to avoid polluting activities on hot days when smog is expected to be at its worst.\n\nTraffic and transportation remain a problem in urban areas. Solutions are implemented, but inevitably the implementation expense and the time required to plan, approve, and build infrastructure can't keep pace with the population growth. There have been some improvements. [[Carpool lane]]s have become common in urban areas, which are intended to encourage people to drive together rather than in individual automobiles. [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] is gradually building a [[light rail]] system (often over routes of an original turn-of-the-century electric railroad line that was torn out and paved over to encourage the advent of the automobile age). None of the implemented solutions are without their critics. The sprawling nature of the Bay Area and of the Los Angeles Basin makes it difficult to build [[mass transit]] that can reach and serve a significant portion of the population.\n\nDuring the 1960s, under the aegis of Chief Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]], the California Supreme Court became more liberal and progressive. Traynor's term as Chief Justice (from 1964 to 1970) was marked by a number of firsts: California was the first state to create true [[strict liability]] in [[product liability]] cases, the first to allow the action of [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] (NIED) even in the absence of physical injury to the plaintiff, and the first to allow bystanders to sue for NIED where the only physical injury was to a relative.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, California became a leader in [[family law]]. California was the first state to allow true [[no-fault divorce]], with the passage of the Family Law Act of 1969. In 1994, the Legislature took family law out of the Civil Code and created a new Family Code. In 2002, the Legislature granted registered domestic partners the same rights under state law as married spouses. In 2008 California became the second state to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] when the California Supreme Court ruled the ban unconstitutional.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the California Supreme Court has become more conservative, particularly with regard to the rights of criminal defendants. This is commonly seen as a reaction against the strict anti-[[death penalty]] stance of Chief Justice [[Rose Bird]] in the early 1980s, although the funding that eventually brought about her defeat was from corporate and business interests concerned with what they felt was an anti-business stance by the Chief Justice. The state's electorate responded by removing her (and two of her perceived liberal allies) from the court in November 1986.\n\n==High-tech expansion==\nStarting in the 1950s, high technology companies in [[Northern California]] began a spectacular growth that continued through the end of the 20th century. The major products included [[personal computer]]s, [[video game]]s, and [[Computer network|networking system]]s. The majority of these companies settled along a highway stretching from [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], notably including [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], all in the [[Santa Clara Valley]], the so-called \"[[Silicon Valley]]\", named after the material used to produce the [[integrated circuit]]s of the era.\n\nThis era peaked in 2000, by which time demand for skilled technical professionals had become so high that the high-tech industry had trouble filling all of its positions and therefore pushed for increased visa quotas so that they could recruit from overseas. When the \"[[Dot-com bubble]]\" burst in 2001, jobs evaporated overnight, and for the first time over the next two years more people moved out of the area than moved in. This somewhat mirrored the collapse of the [[aerospace industry]] in southern California some twenty years earlier.\n\n==2000\u2013present==\nAlthough air pollution problems have been reduced, health problems associated with pollution have continued. The brown haze known as \"[[smog]]\" has been substantially abated thanks to federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust.<ref>William Deverell, and Greg Hise, eds.

Housing prices in urban areas continued to increase so that a modest home that in the 1960s cost $25,000, cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. [[Mortgage]] companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.<ref>Robert M. Hardaway, ''The Great American Housing Bubble: The Road to Collapse'' (2011) p. 22</ref><ref>Stephen D. Cummings and Patrick B. Reddy, ''California after Arnold'' (2009) p. 102</ref>\n\nIn the [[California gubernatorial election, 2002|2002 gubernatorial campaign]], Democratic incumbent [[Gray Davis]] defeated Republican challenger [[Bill Simon (politician)|Bill Simon]]. On October 7, 2003, Davis was [[recall election|recalled]], with 55.4% of the voters supporting the recall (see [[results of the 2003 California recall]]). With a plurality of 48.6% of the vote, Republican [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was chosen as the new governor. Lieutenant Governor [[Cruz Bustamante]] received 31.5% of the vote, and Republican state senator [[Tom McClintock]] received 13.5% of the vote.\n\nSchwarzenegger began his shortened term with a soaring approval rating and soon after began implementing a conservative agenda. This initially resulted in sparring with the heavily Democratic Assembly and Senate over the state budget, battles which provided his infamous \"girly men\" comment but also began taking their toll on his approval rating. Schwarzenegger then embarked on a campaign to enact several ballot propositions in a 2005 special election touted as reforming California's budget system, redistricting powers, and union political fundraising. The union-led campaign spearheaded by the [[California Nurses Association]] contributed heavily to the defeat of every proposition in the special election.\n\nSince this conspicuous failure, Schwarzenegger made a turn back to the left, criticizing the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] at many junctures, reviving his environmental agenda, and compromising with the legislature on the traditionally Democratic issue of education spending. His approval rating also revived, and he was re-elected in 2006. However, continued paralysis in state government and the inability of the legislature and governor to work out the fundamental funding questions resulted in voter disapproval of both the legislators and the governor, whose approval rating was among the lowest ever recorded pending the election of [[Jerry Brown]] in November 2010.\n\n===Religion===\nThe 2014 Pew Religious Landscape Survey showed the religious makeup of California as follows:<ref>Pew Research Center, [http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/california/ \"Religious Landscape Study: California\"]</ref>\n\n:Christian 63%\n::20% Evangelical Protestant\n::10% Mainline Protestant\n:: 2% Black Protestant\n::28% Catholic\n:: 4% Other Christian\n: Non-Christian faiths 9%\n: Unaffiliated 28%\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of California before 1900]]\n* [[History of California]]\n* [[History of Los Angeles]]\n* [[History of San Diego]]\n* [[History of San Francisco]]\n* [[History of the west coast of North America]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Scholarly surveys===\n* Aron, Stephen. \"Convergence, California and the Newest Western History,\" ''California History'' Volume: 86#4 September 2009. pp 4+ historiography.\n* Bakken, Gordon Morris.

The referendum question was a choice between greater autonomy within Papua New Guinea and full independence, voters voted overwhelmingly (98.31%) for independence.\n\nThe referendum was a result of a 2001 agreement between the government of Papua New Guinea and the [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]] that ended a [[Bougainville Civil War|civil war]] fought from 1988 to 1998. The vote is non-binding and the [[government of Papua New Guinea]] has the final say on what becomes of Bougainville.

Following a meeting in [[Port Moresby]] between the two Bougainville MHAs ([[Paul Lapun]] and [[Donatus Mola]]) and around 25 Bougainvilleans, a proposal was put forward in the [[House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea|House of Assembly]] to hold a referendum to decide whether the island should remain part of Papua New Guinea, join the Solomon Islands, or become independent.<ref>[https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-327440427/view?partId=nla.obj-327466639#page/n27/mode/1up There's a 'right of self-determination'] ''Pacific Islands Monthly'', November 1968, p26</ref> However, no vote was held.
