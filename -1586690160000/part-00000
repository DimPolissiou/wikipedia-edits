It followed on from [[ALGOL 58]] which had introduced [[Block (programming)|code blocks]] and the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> pairs for delimiting them, representing a key advance in the rise of [[structured programming]]. ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing [[nested function]] definitions with [[lexical scope]].  It gave rise to many other programming languages, including [[CPL (programming language)|CPL]], [[Simula]], [[BCPL]], [[B (programming language)|B]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[C (programming language)|C]]. Practically every computer of the era had a [[systems programming language]] based on ALGOL 60 concepts.\n\n[[Niklaus Wirth]] based his own [[ALGOL W]] on ALGOL 60 before moving to develop [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the [[ALGOL 68]] committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published. Algol 68 is substantially different from Algol 60 and was criticised partially for being so, so that in general \"Algol\" refers to dialects of Algol 60.\n\n==Standardization==\nALGOL 60 \u2013 with [[COBOL]] \u2013 were the first languages to seek standardization.\n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6126 ISO 1538:1984] Programming languages \u2013 Algol 60 (stabilized)\n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6286 ISO/TR 1672:1977] Hardware representation of ALGOL basic symbols ... (now withdrawn)\n\n==History==\nALGOL 60 was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.\n\n[[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus\u2013Naur form|Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus\u2013Naur form]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Knuth, Donald E. |title=Backus normal Form vs Backus Naur Form |journal=Comm.

Backus]], [[Julien Green (computer scientist)|Julien Green]], [[Charles Katz]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Alan Perlis|Alan J. Perlis]], and [[Joseph Henry Wegstein]] (from the USA).\nAlan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: \"The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent.\"\n\nThe language originally did not include [[recursion]]. It was inserted into the specification at the last minute, against the wishes of some of the committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/how-recursion-got-into-programming-a-comedy-of-errors-3/|title=How recursion got into programming: a tale of intrigue, betrayal, and advanced programming-language semantics|first=Maarten|last=van Emden|date=2014|series=''A Programmer's Place''}}</ref>\n\nALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. [[Tony Hoare]] remarked: \"Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=C.A.R. |last=Hoare |title=Hints on Programming Language Design |date=December 1973 |url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf |page=27}} (This statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to [[Edsger W.

In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (ALGOL 68 parlance for Input/Output) facilities.\n\nALGOL 60 provided two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common [[call-by-value]], and [[call-by-name]]. The procedure declaration specified, for each formal parameter, which was to be used: '''value''' specified for call-by-value, and omitted for call-by-name. Call-by-name has certain effects in contrast to [[call-by-reference]]. For example, without specifying the parameters as ''value'' or ''reference'', it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.<ref>{{cite book | last=Aho | first=Alfred V. | authorlink=Alfred V. Aho | author2=Ravi Sethi | author3-link=Jeffrey Ullman |author3=Jeffrey D.

Now that every time swap is referenced, it's reevaluated. Say i := 1 and A[i] := 2, so every time swap is referenced it'll return the other combination of the values ([1,2], [2,1], [1,2] and so on). A similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument.\n\nCall-by-name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting \"[[Thunk (delayed computation)|thunk]]s\" that are used to implement it. [[Donald Knuth]] devised the \"[[man or boy test]]\" to separate compilers that correctly implemented \"[[recursion (computer science)|recursion]] and non-local references.\" This test contains an example of call-by-name.\n\n===ALGOL 60 Reserved words and restricted identifiers===\nThere are 35 such reserved words in the standard [[Burroughs large systems]] sub-language:\n\n{|\n|\n*<code>ALPHA</code>\n*<code>ARRAY</code>\n*<code>BEGIN</code>\n*<code>BOOLEAN</code>\n*<code>COMMENT</code>\n*<code>CONTINUE</code>\n*<code>DIRECT</code>\n|\n*<code>DO</code>\n*<code>DOUBLE</code>\n*<code>ELSE</code>\n*<code>END</code>\n*<code>EVENT</code>\n*<code>FALSE</code>\n*<code>FILE</code>\n|\n*<code>FOR</code>\n*<code>FORMAT</code>\n*<code>GO</code>\n*<code>IF</code>\n*<code>INTEGER</code>\n*<code>LABEL</code>\n*<code>LIST</code>\n|\n*<code>LONG</code>\n*<code>OWN</code>\n*<code>POINTER</code>\n*<code>PROCEDURE</code>\n*<code>REAL</code>\n*<code>STEP</code>\n*<code>SWITCH</code>\n|\n*<code>TASK</code>\n*<code>THEN</code>\n*<code>TRUE</code>\n*<code>UNTIL</code>\n*<code>VALUE</code>\n*<code>WHILE</code>\n*<code>ZIP</code>\n|}\n\nThere are 71 such restricted identifiers in the standard Burroughs large systems sub-language: \n{|\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>ACCEPT</code>\n*<code>AND</code>\n*<code>ATTACH</code>\n*<code>BY</code>\n*<code>CALL</code>\n*<code>CASE</code>\n*<code>CAUSE</code>\n*<code>CLOSE</code>\n*<code>DEALLOCATE</code>\n*<code>DEFINE</code>\n*<code>DETACH</code>\n*<code>DISABLE</code>\n*<code>DISPLAY</code>\n*<code>DIV</code>\n*<code>DUMP</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>ENABLE</code>\n*<code>EQL</code>\n*<code>EQV</code>\n*<code>EXCHANGE</code>\n*<code>EXTERNAL</code>\n*<code>FILL</code>\n*<code>FORWARD</code>\n*<code>GEQ</code>\n*<code>GTR</code>\n*<code>IMP</code>\n*<code>IN</code>\n*<code>INTERRUPT</code>\n*<code>IS</code>\n*<code>LB</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>LEQ</code>\n*<code>LIBERATE</code>\n*<code>LINE</code>\n*<code>LOCK</code>\n*<code>LSS</code>\n*<code>MERGE</code>\n*<code>MOD</code>\n*<code>MONITOR</code>\n*<code>MUX</code>\n*<code>NEQ</code>\n*<code>NO</code>\n*<code>NOT</code>\n*<code>ON</code>\n*<code>OPEN</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>OR</code>\n*<code>OUT</code>\n*<code>PICTURE</code>\n*<code>PROCESS</code>\n*<code>PROCURE</code>\n*<code>PROGRAMDUMP</code>\n*<code>RB</code>\n*<code>READ</code>\n*<code>RELEASE</code>\n*<code>REPLACE</code>\n*<code>RESET</code>\n*<code>RESIZE</code>\n*<code>REWIND</code>\n*<code>RUN</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>SCAN</code>\n*<code>SEEK</code>\n*<code>SET</code>\n*<code>SKIP</code>\n*<code>SORT</code>\n*<code>SPACE</code>\n*<code>SWAP</code>\n*<code>THRU</code>\n*<code>TIMES</code>\n*<code>TO</code>\n*<code>WAIT</code>\n*<code>WHEN</code>\n*<code>WITH</code>\n*<code>WRITE</code> \n|}\n\nand also the names of all the intrinsic functions.\n\n====Standard Operators====\n{|border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n!bgcolor=#cccccc  COLSPAN=2 ALIGN=CENTER|Priority\n!bgcolor=#cccccc|Operator\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER ROWSPAN=3| first<br>arithmetic ||ALIGN=CENTER| first || \u2191 (power)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER| second || \u00d7, / (real), \u00f7 (integer)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER| third || +, -\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| second || <, \u2264, =, \u2265, >, \u2260\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| third || \u00ac (not)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| fourth || \u2227 (and)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| fifth || \u2228 (or)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| sixth || \u2283 (implication)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| seventh || \u2261 (equivalence)\n|}\n\n==Examples and portability issues==\n\n===Code sample comparisons===\n\n====ALGOL 60====\n\n '''procedure''' Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);\n     '''value''' n, m; '''array''' a; '''integer''' n, m, i, k; '''real''' y;\n '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size n by m,\n     is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k;\n '''begin'''\n     '''integer''' p, q;\n     y := 0; i := k := 1;\n     '''for''' p := 1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' n '''do'''\n         '''for''' q := 1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' m '''do'''\n             '''if''' abs(a[p, q]) > y '''then'''\n                 '''begin''' y := abs(a[p, q]);\n                     i := p; k := q\n                 '''end'''\n '''end''' Absmax\n\nImplementations differ in how the text in bold must be written.

It followed on from [[ALGOL 58]] which had introduced [[Block (programming)|code blocks]] and the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> pairs for delimiting them, representing a key advance in the rise of [[structured programming]]. ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing [[nested function]] definitions with [[lexical scope]].  It gave rise to many other programming languages, including [[CPL (programming language)|CPL]], [[Simula]], [[BCPL]], [[B (programming language)|B]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[C (programming language)|C]]. Practically every computer of the era had a [[systems programming language]] based on ALGOL 60 concepts.\n\n[[Niklaus Wirth]] based his own [[ALGOL W]] on ALGOL 60 before moving to develop [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the [[ALGOL 68]] committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published. Algol 68 is substantially different from Algol 60 and was criticised partially for being so, so that in general \"Algol\" refers to dialects of Algol 60.\n\n==Standardization==\nALGOL 60 \u2013 with [[COBOL]] \u2013 were the first languages to seek standardization.\n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6126 ISO 1538:1984] Programming languages \u2013 Algol 60 (stabilized)\n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6286 ISO/TR 1672:1977] Hardware representation of ALGOL basic symbols ... (now withdrawn)\n\n==History==\nALGOL 60 was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.\n\n[[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus\u2013Naur form|Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus\u2013Naur form]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Knuth, Donald E. |title=Backus normal Form vs Backus Naur Form |journal=Comm.

One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent.\"\n\nThe language originally did not include [[recursion]]. It was inserted into the specification at the last minute, against the wishes of some of the committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/how-recursion-got-into-programming-a-comedy-of-errors-3/|title=How recursion got into programming: a tale of intrigue, betrayal, and advanced programming-language semantics|first=Maarten|last=van Emden|date=2014|series=''A Programmer's Place''}}</ref>\n\nALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it.

In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (ALGOL 68 parlance for Input/Output) facilities.\n\nALGOL 60 provided two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common [[call-by-value]], and [[call-by-name]]. The procedure declaration specified, for each formal parameter, which was to be used: '''value''' specified for call-by-value, and omitted for call-by-name. Call-by-name has certain effects in contrast to [[call-by-reference]]. For example, without specifying the parameters as ''value'' or ''reference'', it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.<ref>{{cite book | last=Aho | first=Alfred V. | authorlink=Alfred V.

Now that every time swap is referenced, it's reevaluated. Say i := 1 and A[i] := 2, so every time swap is referenced it'll return the other combination of the values ([1,2], [2,1], [1,2] and so on). A similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument.\n\nCall-by-name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting \"[[Thunk (delayed computation)|thunk]]s\" that are used to implement it. [[Donald Knuth]] devised the \"[[man or boy test]]\" to separate compilers that correctly implemented \"[[recursion (computer science)|recursion]] and non-local references.\" This test contains an example of call-by-name.\n\n===ALGOL 60 Reserved words and restricted identifiers===\nThere are 35 such reserved words in the standard [[Burroughs large systems]] sub-language:\n\n{|\n|\n*<code>ALPHA</code>\n*<code>ARRAY</code>\n*<code>BEGIN</code>\n*<code>BOOLEAN</code>\n*<code>COMMENT</code>\n*<code>CONTINUE</code>\n*<code>DIRECT</code>\n|\n*<code>DO</code>\n*<code>DOUBLE</code>\n*<code>ELSE</code>\n*<code>END</code>\n*<code>EVENT</code>\n*<code>FALSE</code>\n*<code>FILE</code>\n|\n*<code>FOR</code>\n*<code>FORMAT</code>\n*<code>GO</code>\n*<code>IF</code>\n*<code>INTEGER</code>\n*<code>LABEL</code>\n*<code>LIST</code>\n|\n*<code>LONG</code>\n*<code>OWN</code>\n*<code>POINTER</code>\n*<code>PROCEDURE</code>\n*<code>REAL</code>\n*<code>STEP</code>\n*<code>SWITCH</code>\n|\n*<code>TASK</code>\n*<code>THEN</code>\n*<code>TRUE</code>\n*<code>UNTIL</code>\n*<code>VALUE</code>\n*<code>WHILE</code>\n*<code>ZIP</code>\n|}\n\nThere are 71 such restricted identifiers in the standard Burroughs large systems sub-language: \n{|\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>ACCEPT</code>\n*<code>AND</code>\n*<code>ATTACH</code>\n*<code>BY</code>\n*<code>CALL</code>\n*<code>CASE</code>\n*<code>CAUSE</code>\n*<code>CLOSE</code>\n*<code>DEALLOCATE</code>\n*<code>DEFINE</code>\n*<code>DETACH</code>\n*<code>DISABLE</code>\n*<code>DISPLAY</code>\n*<code>DIV</code>\n*<code>DUMP</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>ENABLE</code>\n*<code>EQL</code>\n*<code>EQV</code>\n*<code>EXCHANGE</code>\n*<code>EXTERNAL</code>\n*<code>FILL</code>\n*<code>FORWARD</code>\n*<code>GEQ</code>\n*<code>GTR</code>\n*<code>IMP</code>\n*<code>IN</code>\n*<code>INTERRUPT</code>\n*<code>IS</code>\n*<code>LB</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>LEQ</code>\n*<code>LIBERATE</code>\n*<code>LINE</code>\n*<code>LOCK</code>\n*<code>LSS</code>\n*<code>MERGE</code>\n*<code>MOD</code>\n*<code>MONITOR</code>\n*<code>MUX</code>\n*<code>NEQ</code>\n*<code>NO</code>\n*<code>NOT</code>\n*<code>ON</code>\n*<code>OPEN</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>OR</code>\n*<code>OUT</code>\n*<code>PICTURE</code>\n*<code>PROCESS</code>\n*<code>PROCURE</code>\n*<code>PROGRAMDUMP</code>\n*<code>RB</code>\n*<code>READ</code>\n*<code>RELEASE</code>\n*<code>REPLACE</code>\n*<code>RESET</code>\n*<code>RESIZE</code>\n*<code>REWIND</code>\n*<code>RUN</code>\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"|\n*<code>SCAN</code>\n*<code>SEEK</code>\n*<code>SET</code>\n*<code>SKIP</code>\n*<code>SORT</code>\n*<code>SPACE</code>\n*<code>SWAP</code>\n*<code>THRU</code>\n*<code>TIMES</code>\n*<code>TO</code>\n*<code>WAIT</code>\n*<code>WHEN</code>\n*<code>WITH</code>\n*<code>WRITE</code> \n|}\n\nand also the names of all the intrinsic functions.\n\n====Standard Operators====\n{|border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n!bgcolor=#cccccc  COLSPAN=2 ALIGN=CENTER|Priority\n!bgcolor=#cccccc|Operator\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER ROWSPAN=3| first<br>arithmetic ||ALIGN=CENTER| first || \u2191 (power)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER| second || \u00d7, / (real), \u00f7 (integer)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER| third || +, -\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| second || <, \u2264, =, \u2265, >, \u2260\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| third || \u00ac (not)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| fourth || \u2227 (and)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| fifth || \u2228 (or)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| sixth || \u2283 (implication)\n|-\n|ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2| seventh || \u2261 (equivalence)\n|}\n\n==Examples and portability issues==\n\n===Code sample comparisons===\n\n====ALGOL 60====\n\n '''procedure''' Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);\n     '''value''' n, m; '''array''' a; '''integer''' n, m, i, k; '''real''' y;\n '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size n by m,\n     is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k;\n '''begin'''\n     '''integer''' p, q;\n     y := 0; i := k := 1;\n     '''for''' p := 1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' n '''do'''\n         '''for''' q := 1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' m '''do'''\n             '''if''' abs(a[p, q]) > y '''then'''\n                 '''begin''' y := abs(a[p, q]);\n                     i := p; k := q\n                 '''end'''\n '''end''' Absmax\n\nImplementations differ in how the text in bold must be written.

As with the earlier and less potent [[dihydrofuran]] series of compounds nicknamed ''FLY'', Bromo-DragonFLY was named after its superficial structural resemblance to a dragonfly.\n\n==Pharmacology==\nThe hallucinogenic effect of bromo-DragonFLY is mediated by its [[agonist]] activity<!-- 93% of 5-HT --> at the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]]. Bromo-DragonFLY also has a high [[binding (molecular)|binding]] [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and  5-HT<sub>2C</sub> [[serotonin]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and is most accurately described as a non-subtype selective 5-HT<sub>2</sub> agonist, as it is actually twice as potent an agonist for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors as for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, as well as being less than 5x selective for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> over 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>.<ref name=\"pmid9857084\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker MA, Marona-Lewicka D, Lucaites VL, Nelson DL, Nichols DE |title=A novel (benzodifuranyl)aminoalkane with extremely potent activity at the 5-HT2A receptor |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=41 |issue=26 |pages=5148\u20139 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9857084 |doi=10.1021/jm9803525 |url=}}</ref><ref>Corazza O, Schifano F, Farre M, Deluca P, Davey Z, Torrens M, Demetrovics Z, Di Furia L, Flesland L, Siemann H, Skutle A, Van Der Kreeft P, Scherbaum N.

This line was {{RailGauge|1000mm}} gauge like the first section until 1955, when the gauge was [[Change of gauge|changed]] for the connection with the Katanga line in 1956. Just north of Kongolo, the Lualaba is unnavigable due to the rapids named ''Portes D'Enfer'' ('Gates of Hell'). The track between Kalemie and Niemba is described by UNJLC in 2006 as 'very degraded' and may not be operational. Boats to [[Moba, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Moba]] and [[Uvira|Kalundu-Uvira]] on Lake Tanganyika used to connect with trains at Kalemie.

This allowed through passenger trains to run between Lubumbashi and Lobito, and freight trains to carry copper from the Zambian and Katangan [[Copperbelt]]s to a seaport for the export of [[copper]]. It was this purpose which provided the investment for the [[Benguela Railway]]. It did not operate through [[Angola]] from the 1970s, due to the civil war there.

The series of standards consists of numbered parts, such as [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-2]], etc. There are 15 parts, excluding the abandoned [[ISO/IEC 8859-12]]. The ISO working group maintaining this series of standards has been disbanded.\n\nISO/IEC 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 were originally [[Ecma International]] standard '''ECMA-94'''.\n\n==Introduction==\nWhile the bit patterns of the 95 [[graphic character|printable]] [[ASCII]] characters are sufficient to exchange information in modern [[English language|English]], most other languages that use [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]]s need additional symbols not covered by ASCII. ISO/IEC 8859 sought to remedy this problem by utilizing the eighth bit in an 8-bit [[byte]] to allow positions for another 96 printable characters. Early encodings were limited to 7&nbsp;bits because of restrictions of some data transmission protocols, and partially for historical reasons. However, more characters were needed than could fit in a single 8-bit character encoding, so several mappings were developed, including at least ten suitable for various Latin alphabets.\n\nThe ISO/IEC 8859-''n'' encodings only contain printable characters, and were designed to be used in conjunction with [[control characters]] mapped to the unassigned bytes. To this end a series of encodings registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] add the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0]] control set (control characters mapped to bytes 0 to 31) from [[ISO/IEC 646|ISO 646]] and the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C1]] control set (control characters mapped to bytes 128<!-- Character 127, the delete character, does not belong to C1 --> to 159) from [[ISO 6429]], resulting in full 8-bit character maps with most, if not all, bytes assigned. These sets have ISO-8859-''n'' as their preferred [[MIME]] name or, in cases where a preferred MIME name is not specified, their canonical name. Many people use the terms ISO/IEC 8859-''n'' and ISO-8859-''n'' interchangeably. [[ISO/IEC 8859-11]] did not get such a charset assigned, presumably because it was almost identical to [[TIS 620]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard is designed for reliable information exchange, not [[typography]]; the standard omits symbols needed for high-quality typography, such as optional ligatures, curly quotation marks, dashes, etc. As a result, high-quality typesetting systems often use proprietary or idiosyncratic extensions on top of the [[ASCII]] and ISO/IEC 8859 standards, or use [[Unicode]] instead.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if a character or symbol was not already part of a widely used data-processing character set and was also not usually provided on typewriter keyboards for a national language, it did not get in. Hence the directional double quotation marks ''\u00ab'' and ''\u00bb'' used for some European languages were included, but not the directional double quotation marks ''\u201c'' and ''\u201d'' used for English and some other languages.\n\nFrench did not get its ''\u0153'' and ''\u0152'' ligatures because they could be typed as 'oe'. Likewise, ''\u0178'', needed for all-caps text, was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Haralambous_2007\"/><ref name=\"Andre_2003\"/><ref name=\"Andre_1996\"/> Albeit under different codepoints, these three characters were later reintroduced with [[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] in 1999, which also introduced the new [[euro sign]] character \u20ac. Likewise Dutch did not get the ''\u0133'' and ''\u0132'' letters, because Dutch speakers had become used to typing these as two letters instead.\n\nRomanian did not initially get its ''\u0218''/''\u0219'' and ''\u021a''/''\u021b'' ([[Comma (punctuation)#Diacritical usage|with comma]]) letters, because these letters were initially unified with ''\u015e''/''\u015f'' and ''\u0162''/''\u0163'' ([[Cedilla|with cedilla]]) by the [[Unicode Consortium]], considering the shapes with comma beneath to be [[glyph]] variants of the shapes with cedilla. However, the letters with explicit comma below were later added to the Unicode standard and are also in [[ISO/IEC 8859-16]].\n\nMost of the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings provide diacritic marks required for various European languages using the Latin script. Others provide non-Latin alphabets: [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]]. Most of the encodings contain only [[spacing characters]], although the Thai, Hebrew, and Arabic ones do also contain [[combining characters]].\n\nThe standard makes no provision for the scripts of East Asian languages (''[[CJK]]''), as their ideographic [[writing system]]s require many thousands of code points. Although it uses Latin based characters, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] does not fit into 96 positions (without using combining diacritics such as in [[Windows-1258]]) either. Each Japanese syllabic alphabet (hiragana or katakana, see [[Kana]]) would fit, as in [[JIS X 0201]], but like several other alphabets of the world they are not encoded in the ISO/IEC 8859 system.\n\n==The parts of ISO/IEC 8859==\nISO/IEC 8859 is divided into the following parts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, there are some characters and language combinations that are not accommodated without transcriptions. Efforts were made to make conversions as smooth as possible. For example, German has all of its seven special characters at the same positions in all Latin variants (1\u20134, 9, 10, 13\u201316), and in many positions the characters only differ in the diacritics between the sets. In particular, variants 1\u20134 were designed jointly, and have the property that every encoded character appears either at a given position or not at all.\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

LRM stands for [[left-to-right mark]] (U+200E) and RLM stands for [[right-to-left mark]] (U+200F).\n\n==Relationship to Unicode and the UCS==\nSince 1991, the Unicode Consortium has been working with ISO and IEC to develop the [[Unicode|Unicode Standard]] and [[Universal Character Set|ISO/IEC 10646: the Universal Character Set]] (UCS) in tandem. Newer editions of ISO/IEC 8859 express characters in terms of their Unicode/UCS names and the ''U+nnnn'' notation, effectively causing each part of ISO/IEC 8859 to be a Unicode/UCS character encoding scheme that maps a very small subset of the UCS to single 8-bit bytes. The first 256 characters in Unicode and the UCS are identical to those in ISO/IEC-8859-1 ([[Latin-1]]).\n\nSingle-byte character sets including the parts of ISO/IEC 8859 and derivatives of them were favoured throughout the 1990s, having the advantages of being well-established and more easily implemented in software: the equation of one byte to one character is simple and adequate for most single-language applications, and there are no combining characters or variant forms. As Unicode-enabled operating systems became more widespread, ISO/IEC 8859 and other legacy encodings became less popular. While remnants of ISO 8859 and single-byte character models remain entrenched in many operating systems, programming languages, data storage systems, networking applications, display hardware, and end-user application software, most modern computing applications use Unicode internally, and rely on conversion tables to map to and from other encodings, when necessary.\n\n==Development status==\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard was maintained by ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 2, Working Group 3 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 3). In June 2004, WG 3 disbanded, and maintenance duties were transferred to [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2|SC 2]]. The standard is not currently being updated, as the Subcommittee's only remaining [[working group]], WG 2, is concentrating on development of Unicode's [[Universal Coded Character Set]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of computer character sets]]\n* [[RPL character set]] (An ISO 8859-1 superset on HP calculators, referred to as \"ECMA-94\" as well)\n* [[DEC Multinational Character Set]] (MCS)\n* [[DEC National Replacement Character Set]] (NRCS)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Missing_vowels\">Missing several accented vowels including ''[[\u00d8|\u01fe]]'' and ''\u01ff''.

The series of standards consists of numbered parts, such as [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-2]], etc. There are 15 parts, excluding the abandoned [[ISO/IEC 8859-12]]. The ISO working group maintaining this series of standards has been disbanded.\n\nISO/IEC 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 were originally [[Ecma International]] standard '''ECMA-94'''.\n\n==Introduction==\nWhile the bit patterns of the 95 [[graphic character|printable]] [[ASCII]] characters are sufficient to exchange information in modern [[English language|English]], most other languages that use [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]]s need additional symbols not covered by ASCII. ISO/IEC 8859 sought to remedy this problem by utilizing the eighth bit in an 8-bit [[byte]] to allow positions for another 96 printable characters. Early encodings were limited to 7&nbsp;bits because of restrictions of some data transmission protocols, and partially for historical reasons. However, more characters were needed than could fit in a single 8-bit character encoding, so several mappings were developed, including at least ten suitable for various Latin alphabets.\n\nThe ISO/IEC 8859-''n'' encodings only contain printable characters, and were designed to be used in conjunction with [[control characters]] mapped to the unassigned bytes. To this end a series of encodings registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] add the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0]] control set (control characters mapped to bytes 0 to 31) from [[ISO/IEC 646|ISO 646]] and the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C1]] control set (control characters mapped to bytes 128<!-- Character 127, the delete character, does not belong to C1 --> to 159) from [[ISO 6429]], resulting in full 8-bit character maps with most, if not all, bytes assigned. These sets have ISO-8859-''n'' as their preferred [[MIME]] name or, in cases where a preferred MIME name is not specified, their canonical name. Many people use the terms ISO/IEC 8859-''n'' and ISO-8859-''n'' interchangeably. [[ISO/IEC 8859-11]] did not get such a charset assigned, presumably because it was almost identical to [[TIS 620]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard is designed for reliable information exchange, not [[typography]]; the standard omits symbols needed for high-quality typography, such as optional ligatures, curly quotation marks, dashes, etc. As a result, high-quality typesetting systems often use proprietary or idiosyncratic extensions on top of the [[ASCII]] and ISO/IEC 8859 standards, or use [[Unicode]] instead.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if a character or symbol was not already part of a widely used data-processing character set and was also not usually provided on typewriter keyboards for a national language, it did not get in. Hence the directional double quotation marks ''\u00ab'' and ''\u00bb'' used for some European languages were included, but not the directional double quotation marks ''\u201c'' and ''\u201d'' used for English and some other languages.\n\nFrench did not get its ''\u0153'' and ''\u0152'' ligatures because they could be typed as 'oe'. Likewise, ''\u0178'', needed for all-caps text, was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Haralambous_2007\"/><ref name=\"Andre_2003\"/><ref name=\"Andre_1996\"/> Albeit under different codepoints, these three characters were later reintroduced with [[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] in 1999, which also introduced the new [[euro sign]] character \u20ac. Likewise Dutch did not get the ''\u0133'' and ''\u0132'' letters, because Dutch speakers had become used to typing these as two letters instead.\n\nRomanian did not initially get its ''\u0218''/''\u0219'' and ''\u021a''/''\u021b'' ([[Comma (punctuation)#Diacritical usage|with comma]]) letters, because these letters were initially unified with ''\u015e''/''\u015f'' and ''\u0162''/''\u0163'' ([[Cedilla|with cedilla]]) by the [[Unicode Consortium]], considering the shapes with comma beneath to be [[glyph]] variants of the shapes with cedilla. However, the letters with explicit comma below were later added to the Unicode standard and are also in [[ISO/IEC 8859-16]].\n\nMost of the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings provide diacritic marks required for various European languages using the Latin script. Others provide non-Latin alphabets: [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]]. Most of the encodings contain only [[spacing characters]], although the Thai, Hebrew, and Arabic ones do also contain [[combining characters]].\n\nThe standard makes no provision for the scripts of East Asian languages (''[[CJK]]''), as their ideographic [[writing system]]s require many thousands of code points. Although it uses Latin based characters, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] does not fit into 96 positions (without using combining diacritics such as in [[Windows-1258]]) either. Each Japanese syllabic alphabet (hiragana or katakana, see [[Kana]]) would fit, as in [[JIS X 0201]], but like several other alphabets of the world they are not encoded in the ISO/IEC 8859 system.\n\n==The parts of ISO/IEC 8859==\nISO/IEC 8859 is divided into the following parts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[ISO/IEC 8859-16|Part&nbsp;16]]\n| ''Latin-10'' <br/>''South-Eastern European''\n| [[ISO/IEC 8859-16:2001|2001]]\n| [[SR 14111]] (1998)\n| Intended for [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], but also Finnish, French, German and [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] (new orthography). The focus lies more on letters than symbols. The [[Currency (typography)|currency sign]] is replaced with the [[euro sign]].\n|}\n\nEach part of ISO/IEC 8859 is designed to support languages that often borrow from each other, so the characters needed by each language are usually accommodated by a single part. However, there are some characters and language combinations that are not accommodated without transcriptions. Efforts were made to make conversions as smooth as possible. For example, German has all of its seven special characters at the same positions in all Latin variants (1\u20134, 9, 10, 13\u201316), and in many positions the characters only differ in the diacritics between the sets. In particular, variants 1\u20134 were designed jointly, and have the property that every encoded character appears either at a given position or not at all.\n\n===Table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

LRM stands for [[left-to-right mark]] (U+200E) and RLM stands for [[right-to-left mark]] (U+200F).\n\n==Relationship to Unicode and the UCS==\nSince 1991, the Unicode Consortium has been working with ISO and IEC to develop the [[Unicode|Unicode Standard]] and [[Universal Character Set|ISO/IEC 10646: the Universal Character Set]] (UCS) in tandem. Newer editions of ISO/IEC 8859 express characters in terms of their Unicode/UCS names and the ''U+nnnn'' notation, effectively causing each part of ISO/IEC 8859 to be a Unicode/UCS character encoding scheme that maps a very small subset of the UCS to single 8-bit bytes. The first 256 characters in Unicode and the UCS are identical to those in ISO/IEC-8859-1 ([[Latin-1]]).\n\nSingle-byte character sets including the parts of ISO/IEC 8859 and derivatives of them were favoured throughout the 1990s, having the advantages of being well-established and more easily implemented in software: the equation of one byte to one character is simple and adequate for most single-language applications, and there are no combining characters or variant forms. As Unicode-enabled operating systems became more widespread, ISO/IEC 8859 and other legacy encodings became less popular. While remnants of ISO 8859 and single-byte character models remain entrenched in many operating systems, programming languages, data storage systems, networking applications, display hardware, and end-user application software, most modern computing applications use Unicode internally, and rely on conversion tables to map to and from other encodings, when necessary.\n\n==Development status==\nThe ISO/IEC 8859 standard was maintained by ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 2, Working Group 3 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 3).

It was intended to participate in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] with similar formations from other parts of [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nCreated in July 1941, the Walloon Legion was created by the [[Rexist Party]] as a means of demonstrating its loyalty and indispensability in German-occupied Belgium where it had been largely ignored since the [[Battle of Belgium|invasion of May 1940]]. A similar formation had already been created by Flemish collaborators. The Walloon Legion, initially part of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht]], was joined by the Rexist leader [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]] but remained no larger than a [[battalion]]. It participated in fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from February 1942 but the heavy losses experienced by the unit proved difficult to replace in Belgium. \n\nIt became part of the [[Waffen-SS]] in June 1943 and was almost destroyed by Soviet forces in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944. It expanded slightly after the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944 as Belgian, French, and Spanish soldiers were drafted in and was upgraded to the notional status of a [[Division (military)|division]]. After heavy losses and desertions, its remaining personnel surrendered to British forces in April 1945.\n\n==Origins==\n===Rexist Party and collaboration===\nAt the time of the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion]] in May 1940, Belgium had several political parties that were broadly sympathetic to the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[anti-democratic]] ideals represented by [[Nazi Germany]]. In [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], the largest of these groups was the [[Rexist Party]], led by [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]]. This had originated as a faction of the mainstream [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Block]], but split in 1935 to form an independent [[populism|populist]] party. Ideologically, Rex supported [[Belgian nationalism]], but its support for [[corporatism]] and [[anti-communism]] made it sympathetic towards aspects of [[Nazi ideology]]. It achieved some early success, peaking [[1936 Belgian general election|at the elections of 1936]] in which it received 11.5 percent of the national vote, but experienced a decline in the following years before the German invasion and remained marginal.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=261}}\n\nAfter the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, a German [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Administration]] was created to govern the occupied  territory. Preferring a strategy of [[indirect rule]], the administration preferred to work with established Belgian political and social elites, largely ignoring fringe political groups such as the Rexists.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=262\u2013263}}\n\n===Creation of the Walloon Legion===\n[[File:You defend Belgium....jpg|thumb|Recruitment poster for the Walloon Legion, appealing to [[Belgian nationalism|Belgian nationalist]] sentiments. The caption reads \"You defend Belgium... by fighting on the Eastern Front\".]]\nIn order to acquire more influence and German support, Rex attempted to bring itself closer to the occupation authorities. On 1 January 1941, Degrelle announced Rex's total support for the occupation authorities and for the policy of collaborationism. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, it embraced the idea of raising a military unit, seen as \"a political opportunity to increase the importance of their movements and eliminate political competition\".{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} At the same time, the [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond]] (VNV), a [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalist]] and rival authoritarian party in Flanders, also announced its intention to form a \"[[Flemish Legion]]\" to fight in the German Army in the [[Soviet Union]]. This move, combined with the Germans' favourable stance towards the VNV, meant that it would not be possible to realise Rex's preferred option of a national \"Belgian Legion\" on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=243}}\n\nIn July 1941, Rex announced that it would raise a unit of volunteers of its own, dubbed the Walloon Legion (''L\u00e9gion Wallonie''). The unit would form part of the [[Wehrmacht]] because Walloons were not considered sufficiently \"Germanic\" by [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial theorists]] to enlist in the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=266}} Recruitment initially met with little success, leading Degrelle personally to volunteer for the unit as a private. In total, some 850 men (mostly Rexist [[Cadre (politics)|cadres]]) had volunteered by August 1941, bringing the unit up to the strength of an [[infantry battalion]].{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=267}} Officially designated as Infantry Battalion 373 (''Infanterie Bataillon 373''), it was sent for training in [[Kreis Meseritz|Meseritz]], Germany. As part of Degrelle's ideal of an expanded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian-style Belgium]], the unit adopted the [[Cross of Burgundy|Burgundian cross]] as its insignia.\n\nInitially, most of the volunteers came from the cadres of Rex and in particular its paramilitary militia, the ''Formations de Combat''. In propaganda, Rex emphasised the anti-communist nature of the conflict and argued that collaboration was compatible with Belgian nationalism.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=266\u2013268}} Initially, the unit encountered various internal problems with some volunteers being unwilling to swear allegiance to [[Adolf Hitler]] and others being classed as medically unfit: almost a third of the volunteers were repatriated before October 1941.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=270}} Over the winter of 1941\u20131942, it participated in training and [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operations]] near [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]].{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=244}}\n\n==Eastern Front==\n===In the Wehrmacht, 1942\u20131943===\nThe Walloon Legion fought its first engagement against Soviet forces at Gromowaja-Balka, near Donetsk, on 28 February 1942 as part of the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]]. It suffered heavy losses, both from disease and combat, and was reduced to 150 men within its first months.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=100}} It continued to encounter \"enormous losses\" throughout 1942.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} Its record in combat, however, was widely exploited in propaganda and increased Degrelle's legitimacy in the eyes of the German leadership, especially [[Heinrich Himmler]] who commanded the SS. In late 1942, Himmler declared the Walloons to be a Germanic race, paving the way for the unit's incorporation into the Waffen-SS on 1 June 1943. The Walloon Legion was re-organised into an SS [[brigade]]-sized unit of 2,000 men, known as the SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia (''SS- Sturmbrigade Wallonien'').{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=272}}\n\nThe high attrition rate within the Walloon Legion required increasing focus on recruitment. A second recruitment drive was started in February 1942, recruiting 450 new volunteers of whom many came from Rex's small youth wing. A third \"frantic\" campaign in November 1942 raised a further 1,700 men. These recruitment drives weakened many Rexist institutions by diverting manpower away from projects in Belgium. Attempts to recruit from [[Belgian prisoners of war in World War II|Belgian prisoners of war]] proved a failure.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=101}} However, Degrelle became increasingly keen on the political potential of the Walloon Legion which he saw as a more effective political tool than the Rexist Party in Belgium.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} As the war continued and the pool of Rexist members fell, the volunteers became \"largely non-political 'adventurers' or desperate men\", often drawn from the urban working class and the unemployed.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=286}}\n\n===In the Waffen-SS, 1943\u20131945===\n[[File:L\u00e9on Degrelle \u00e0 Charleroi - 02.jpg|thumb|[[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of Rex and member of the Walloon Legion, pictured in [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Degrelle saw the Legion as a political tool to gain German support]]\nIn November 1943, the new SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia was deployed for the first time to the Ukraine in response to the Soviet [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. There, the brigade fought as part of the [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|SS ''Wiking'' Panzer Division]] in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944 and suffered 70 percent casualties.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} Among those killed was the unit's commander Lucien Lippert.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} A detachment also fought at the [[Battle of Tannenberg Line|Tannenberg Line]] in [[Estonia]] in June 1944, also suffering heavy losses. Degrelle, however, was widely celebrated for his role in the battle at Cherkassy and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]], becoming \"the poster boy for all European collaborators\" and being featured in ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} The remnants of the unit returned to Belgium where parades were held in [[Brussels]] and [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Ahead of its return, largely to encourage more enlistments, the unit was even loaned armoured vehicles by other German units to make it seem more prestigious.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944, Degrelle managed to get the brigade upgraded to [[division (military)|division]]-status, after drafting Rexist refugees fleeing the Allied advance and Walloon volunteers from the paramilitary [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK). The new 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division \"Wallonia\" (''28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division Wallonien'') was created in October 1944. It numbered fewer than 4,000 men, making it considerably understrength,{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} and French and Spanish soldiers from the [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism]] (LVF) and [[Blue Division]] were folded into the unit to increase its numbers.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} During the retreat, Walloon soldiers participated in the massacre of 6,000 Jewish female prisoners of [[Stutthof concentration camp]] in January 1945.<ref>{{cite news |title=Des soldats wallons ont particip\u00e9 au massacre de 6000 femmes juives: \"Ils d\u00e9crivent le plaisir qu'ils \u00e9prouvaient \u00e0 les ex\u00e9cuter\" |url=https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/societe/des-soldats-wallons-ont-participe-au-massacre-de-6000-femmes-juives-ils-decrivent-le-plaisir-qu-ils-eprouvaient-a-executer-ces-femmes-5ddd2b4c9978e272f9317ae1 |accessdate=26 November 2019 |agency=La Libre Belgique |date=26 November 2019}}</ref> The following month, the remains of the \"division\" saw action during [[Operation Solstice]] and were forced to retreat through [[Central Pomerania]] to [[Stettin]] on the [[Oder river]]. After mass defections in April its remaining 400 personnel fled to [[L\u00fcbeck]] where they surrendered to the British Army to escape [[German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|capture by Soviet forces]].\n\nAltogether, between 7,000 and 8,000 men served in the Walloon Legion between 1941 and 1944, slightly less than the number of Flemish who served in comparable formations. Some 1,337 were killed,{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=274}} representing about a fifth of its total strength.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} However, its maximum field strength had never exceeded 2,000 men.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} Fearing execution for treason in Belgium, Degrelle escaped to [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] and then fled to [[Francoist Spain]] where he remained in exile until his death in 1994.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Plisnier|first=Flore|title=Ils ont pris les armes pour Hitler: la collaboration arm\u00e9e en Belgique francophone|location=Brussels|publisher=Renaissance du Livre|year=2011|isbn=9782507003616}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Wouters|first1=Nico|editor1-last=Stahel|editor1-first=David|title=Joining Hitler's Crusade: European Nations and the Invasion of the Soviet Union, 1941|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-316-51034-6|pages=260\u2013287|chapter=Belgium}}\n*{{cite book |ref={{harvid|Dictionnaire|2008}}|editor1-last=Aron |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Gotovitch |editor2-first=Jos\u00e9 |title=Dictionnaire de la seconde guerre mondiale en Belgique |date=2008 |publisher=Andr\u00e9 Versaille |location=Brussels |isbn=978-2-87495-001-8 |pages=243\u2013245 |chapter=L\u00e9gion Wallonie}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last1=Conway|first1=Martin|title=Collaboration in Belgium: L\u00e9on Degrelle and the Rexist movement, 1940-1944|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0300055009}}\n* {{cite book|last1=De Bruyne|first1=Eddy|title=Les Wallons meurent \u00e0 l'est: la L\u00e9gion Wallonie et L\u00e9on Degrelle sur le Front russe, 1941-1945 |date=1991|publisher=Didier Hatier|location=Paris |isbn=9782870887400}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=David|title=The Patriotic Traitors: A History of Collaboration in German-occupied Europe, 1940-45 |date=1972|publisher=Heinemann |location=London|isbn=0-434-42725-X}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.belgiumwwii.be/belgique-en-guerre/articles/legion-wallonie.html L\u00e9gion Wallonie] at Belgium-WWII ([[Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society|Cegesoma]])\n\n{{SS Brigades}}\n{{SS Divisions}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Foreign volunteer units of the Waffen-SS]]\n[[Category:Infantry divisions of the Waffen-SS]]\n[[Category:Belgian collaboration during World War II]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1941]]\n[[Category:1941 establishments in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Collaboration with the Axis Powers]]\n[[Category:Anti-communist organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Belgian military expedition to Mexico in 1867|Belgian Legion}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name               = Walloon Legion\n| abbreviation            = \n| image                   = Wallonie shield.svg\n| image_size              = 155px\n| caption                 = Insignia of the Walloon Legion, incorporating the [[flag of Belgium]]\n| dates                   = 1941\u20131945\n| country                 = {{flag|Belgium}}\n| allegiance              = {{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Nazi Germany]]\n| branch                  = {{flagicon image|War Ensign of Germany (1938-1945).svg}} [[Wehrmacht]] <small>(1941-43)</small><br/>{{flagicon image|Flag Schutzstaffel.svg}} [[Waffen-SS]] <small>(1943-45)</small>\n| type                    = [[Battalion]], [[brigade]] and later [[division (military)|division]], though never larger than brigade-strength.\n| role                    = [[Infantry]]\n| size                    = 2,000 (maximum strength)<br/>7,000\u20138,000 men (total, 1941\u20131945)\n| command_structure       = \n| notable_commanders      = [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]]\n| battles                 = \n{{tree list}}\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ([[World War II]])\n** [[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung|Anti-Partisan operations in Ukraine]]\n** [[Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket]]\n** [[Battle of Narva (1944)]]\n** [[Battle of Tannenberg Line]]\n** [[Courland Pocket]]\n**{{tree list/final branch}} [[Operation Sonnenwende]]\n{{tree list/end}}\n}}\nThe '''Walloon Legion''' ({{lang-fr|L\u00e9gion Wallonie}}) was a [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] military formation recruited among French-speaking volunteers from [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German-occupied Belgium]], notably from [[Brussels]] and [[Wallonia]], during [[World War II]].

In propaganda, Rex emphasised the anti-communist nature of the conflict and argued that collaboration was compatible with Belgian nationalism.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=266\u2013268}} Initially, the unit encountered various internal problems with some volunteers being unwilling to swear allegiance to [[Adolf Hitler]] and others being classed as medically unfit: almost a third of the volunteers were repatriated before October 1941.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=270}} Over the winter of 1941\u20131942, it participated in training and [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|anti-partisan operations]] near [[Donetsk]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]].{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=244}}\n\n==Eastern Front==\n===In the Wehrmacht, 1942\u20131943===\nThe Walloon Legion fought its first engagement against Soviet forces at Gromowaja-Balka, near Donetsk, on 28 February 1942 as part of the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]]. It suffered heavy losses, both from disease and combat, and was reduced to 150 men within its first months.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=100}} It continued to encounter \"enormous losses\" throughout 1942.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} Its record in combat, however, was widely exploited in propaganda and increased Degrelle's legitimacy in the eyes of the German leadership, especially [[Heinrich Himmler]] who commanded the SS. In late 1942, Himmler declared the Walloons to be a Germanic race, paving the way for the unit's incorporation into the Waffen-SS on 1 June 1943. The Walloon Legion was re-organised into an SS [[brigade]]-sized unit of 2,000 men, known as the SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia (''SS- Sturmbrigade Wallonien'').{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=272}}\n\nThe high attrition rate within the Walloon Legion required increasing focus on recruitment. A second recruitment drive was started in February 1942, recruiting 450 new volunteers of whom many came from Rex's small youth wing. A third \"frantic\" campaign in November 1942 raised a further 1,700 men. These recruitment drives weakened many Rexist institutions by diverting manpower away from projects in Belgium. Attempts to recruit from [[Belgian prisoners of war in World War II|Belgian prisoners of war]] proved a failure.{{sfn|Plisnier|2011|p=101}} However, Degrelle became increasingly keen on the political potential of the Walloon Legion which he saw as a more effective political tool than the Rexist Party in Belgium.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|pp=271\u2013272}} As the war continued and the pool of Rexist members fell, the volunteers became \"largely non-political 'adventurers' or desperate men\", often drawn from the urban working class and the unemployed.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=286}}\n\n===In the Waffen-SS, 1943\u20131945===\n[[File:L\u00e9on Degrelle \u00e0 Charleroi - 02.jpg|thumb|[[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of Rex and member of the Walloon Legion, pictured in [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Degrelle saw the Legion as a political tool to gain German support]]\nIn November 1943, the new SS-''Sturmbrigade'' Wallonia was deployed for the first time to the Ukraine in response to the Soviet [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. There, the brigade fought as part of the [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking|SS ''Wiking'' Panzer Division]] in the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] in February 1944 and suffered 70 percent casualties.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} Among those killed was the unit's commander Lucien Lippert.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} A detachment also fought at the [[Battle of Tannenberg Line|Tannenberg Line]] in [[Estonia]] in June 1944, also suffering heavy losses. Degrelle, however, was widely celebrated for his role in the battle at Cherkassy and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]], becoming \"the poster boy for all European collaborators\" and being featured in ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} The remnants of the unit returned to Belgium where parades were held in [[Brussels]] and [[Charleroi]] in April 1944. Ahead of its return, largely to encourage more enlistments, the unit was even loaned armoured vehicles by other German units to make it seem more prestigious.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Liberation of Belgium|Allied Liberation of Belgium]] in September 1944, Degrelle managed to get the brigade upgraded to [[division (military)|division]]-status, after drafting Rexist refugees fleeing the Allied advance and Walloon volunteers from the paramilitary [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK). The new 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division \"Wallonia\" (''28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division Wallonien'') was created in October 1944. It numbered fewer than 4,000 men, making it considerably understrength,{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=273}} and French and Spanish soldiers from the [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism]] (LVF) and [[Blue Division]] were folded into the unit to increase its numbers.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} During the retreat, Walloon soldiers participated in the massacre of 6,000 Jewish female prisoners of [[Stutthof concentration camp]] in January 1945.<ref>{{cite news |title=Des soldats wallons ont particip\u00e9 au massacre de 6000 femmes juives: \"Ils d\u00e9crivent le plaisir qu'ils \u00e9prouvaient \u00e0 les ex\u00e9cuter\" |url=https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/societe/des-soldats-wallons-ont-participe-au-massacre-de-6000-femmes-juives-ils-decrivent-le-plaisir-qu-ils-eprouvaient-a-executer-ces-femmes-5ddd2b4c9978e272f9317ae1 |accessdate=26 November 2019 |agency=La Libre Belgique |date=26 November 2019}}</ref> The following month, the remains of the \"division\" saw action during [[Operation Solstice]] and were forced to retreat through [[Central Pomerania]] to [[Stettin]] on the [[Oder river]]. After mass defections in April its remaining 400 personnel fled to [[L\u00fcbeck]] where they surrendered to the British Army to escape [[German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|capture by Soviet forces]].\n\nAltogether, between 7,000 and 8,000 men served in the Walloon Legion between 1941 and 1944, slightly less than the number of Flemish who served in comparable formations. Some 1,337 were killed,{{sfn|Wouters|2018|p=274}} representing about a fifth of its total strength.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} However, its maximum field strength had never exceeded 2,000 men.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}} Fearing execution for treason in Belgium, Degrelle escaped to [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] and then fled to [[Francoist Spain]] where he remained in exile until his death in 1994.{{sfn|Dictionnaire|2008|p=245}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Plisnier|first=Flore|title=Ils ont pris les armes pour Hitler: la collaboration arm\u00e9e en Belgique francophone|location=Brussels|publisher=Renaissance du Livre|year=2011|isbn=9782507003616}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Wouters|first1=Nico|editor1-last=Stahel|editor1-first=David|title=Joining Hitler's Crusade: European Nations and the Invasion of the Soviet Union, 1941|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-316-51034-6|pages=260\u2013287|chapter=Belgium}}\n*{{cite book |ref={{harvid|Dictionnaire|2008}}|editor1-last=Aron |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Gotovitch |editor2-first=Jos\u00e9 |title=Dictionnaire de la seconde guerre mondiale en Belgique |date=2008 |publisher=Andr\u00e9 Versaille |location=Brussels |isbn=978-2-87495-001-8 |pages=243\u2013245 |chapter=L\u00e9gion Wallonie}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last1=Conway|first1=Martin|title=Collaboration in Belgium: L\u00e9on Degrelle and the Rexist movement, 1940-1944|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0300055009}}\n* {{cite book|last1=De Bruyne|first1=Eddy|title=Les Wallons meurent \u00e0 l'est: la L\u00e9gion Wallonie et L\u00e9on Degrelle sur le Front russe, 1941-1945 |date=1991|publisher=Didier Hatier|location=Paris |isbn=9782870887400}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=David|title=The Patriotic Traitors: A History of Collaboration in German-occupied Europe, 1940-45 |date=1972|publisher=Heinemann |location=London|isbn=0-434-42725-X}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.belgiumwwii.be/belgique-en-guerre/articles/legion-wallonie.html L\u00e9gion Wallonie] at Belgium-WWII ([[Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society|Cegesoma]])\n\n{{SS Brigades}}\n{{SS Divisions}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Foreign volunteer units of the Waffen-SS]]\n[[Category:Infantry divisions of the Waffen-SS]]\n[[Category:Belgian collaboration during World War II]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1941]]\n[[Category:1941 establishments in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 disestablishments in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Collaboration with the Axis Powers]]\n[[Category:Anti-communist organizations]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toDivision(link changed toDivision (military)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walloon_Legion"}

Having competed in ten consecutive contests until {{Escyr|1966}}, Denmark was absent for eleven consecutive contests from {{Escyr|1967}} to {{Escyr|1977}}. Since {{Escyr|1978}}, it has been absent from only four contests. Denmark has won the contest three times: in {{Escyr|1963}}, {{Escyr|2000}} and {{Escyr|2013}}. The Danish national selection for the contest is the [[Dansk Melodi Grand Prix]].\n\nDenmark finished third on its debut in {{escyr|1957}} with [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], before winning the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]] with the song \"[[Dansevise]]\" performed by [[Grethe & J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]]. The country returned to the top three 25 years later, with third-place finishes for [[Hot Eyes]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988]] and [[Birthe Kj\u00e6r]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]], while Denmark's only top five result of the 1990s was [[Aud Wilken]]'s fifth place in {{escyr|1995}}.\n\nDenmark won the contest for the second time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] with the [[Olsen Brothers]] and the song \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". Denmark then finished second as hosts in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]] with \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\" performed by [[Rollo & King]], before [[Malene Mortensen]] became the first Danish entry to finish last in {{escyr|2002}}. Denmark won the contest for the third time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], with [[Only Teardrops]] performed by [[Emmelie de Forest]]. Denmark has placed in the top five 14 times.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Denmark's debut ===\nDenmark first participated at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957]], held in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. The country had intended to compete at the first contest in 1956, but had submitted its application past the deadline and was, therefore, not allowed to compete. Denmark was the first [[Nordic country]] to take part in the contest, with [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]] following soon after. [[Iceland]], however, did not take part until 1986.\n\nDenmark's first participants were [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], who sang the song \"[[Skibet skal sejle i nat]]\" ({{lang-en|The Ship Will Be Leaving Tonight}}). Their performance was controversial as, at the end of the song, the couple performed an 11-second kiss, which caused outcry in some countries. Nevertheless, the performance achieved third place.\n\n=== First victory ===\nDenmark won the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], when [[Grethe Ingmann|Grethe]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]] sang \"[[Dansevise]]\" (Dance Ballad). The victory, however, was controversial. When Norway announced its votes, the presenter [[Katie Boyle]] could not hear the spokesperson and said that she would call them again later. Viewers around Europe, however, did hear the Norwegian spokesperson, and when Boyle called the Norwegian spokesperson again, the votes had been changed, changing the outcome of the contest and giving the victory to Denmark at the expense of [[Switzerland]]. In fact, the reason why Norway had to announce its votes again was that the Norwegian spokesperson did not follow the right procedure the first time and, therefore, there was doubt whether he gave the correct votes on the first occasion.\n\nThe final result was valid and the victory went to Denmark. Accordingly, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]], the contest was held in Denmark for the first time.\n\n=== Absence and return ===\nAfter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 contest]] and a record low 14th place, Denmark withdrew from the contest, as DR\u00b4s new head of entertainment Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaiser did not view the contest as being quality entertainment. Dansk Melodi Grand Prix was not held from that year onwards.\n\nHowever, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978 contest]], after 11 years' absence, and following Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaisers departure from DR, Denmark returned to the contest, represented by [[Mabel (band)|Mabel]] and the song \"[[Boom Boom (Mabel song)|Boom Boom]]\".\n\n=== Success ===\nDenmark's most successful time at the contest came between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]], with the country reaching the top eight in six out of seven contests, including four top-five placings. The duo of [[Hot Eyes]] represented the nation three times during this period. In 1984, they sang the song \"[[Det' lige det]]\" (That's Just It) and finished fourth. In 1985, they became the first and, as of 2018 only act to represent Denmark in two consecutive years. Singing \"[[Sku' du sp\u00f8rg' fra no'en?]]\" (What Business Is It Of Yours?), they could not repeat their success of the previous year and came 11th. In 1988, Hot Eyes represented Denmark again with \"[[Ka' du se hva' jeg sa'?]]\" (Didn't I Tell You So?). The duo scored its best result to date, finishing in third place, losing only to [[Celine Dion]] and [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]]. Denmark's other good results during this time were sixth place for [[Lise Haavik]] in 1986, fifth for [[Anne-Cathrine Herdorf]] & Bandjo in 1987, third for [[Birthe Kjaer]] in 1989 and eighth for [[Lonnie Devantier]] in 1990.\n\n=== Denmark's fall ===\nAfter 1990, Denmark fell from its high positions of the 1980s and was relegated from the contest on three occasions in the 1990s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]], [[Tommy Seebach]], who had previously represented Denmark in 1979 and 1981, finished 22nd, resulting Denmark being relegated from the contest in 1994. [[Aud Wilken]] sang \"[[Fra Mols til Skagen]]\" for the nation at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] and came 5th, but this high placing could not be repeated in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]], as Denmark's entry, \"Kun med dig\" sung by Dorthe Andersen and Martin Loft, did not qualify from the pre-qualifying round of the contest. In 1998, Denmark was once again relegated from the contest following a poor result in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]].\n\n=== Return to success in the 2000s ===\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]], the abolition of the language rule, which had required all countries to sing in their official languages, brought a return to success for Denmark, when [[Michael Teschl]] and [[Trine Jepsen]] finished 8th with \"[[This Time I Mean It]]\".\n\nA year later, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], Denmark would go on to win the contest again, with brothers [[Olsen Brothers|J\u00f8rgen and Niels Olsen]] defying the odds (they were considerably older than their competitors and only one male duo had won before), to win with \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". The song went on to enjoy huge success around Europe.\n\nAt the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 contest]], held in [[Copenhagen]], [[Rollo & King]] came second with the song \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\". However, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]], despite being a favourite to win the contest, [[Malene Mortensen]] came 24th (last) with \"[[Tell Me Who You Are (Malene song)|Tell Me Who You Are]]\", giving Denmark its worst result ever. Therefore, Denmark was relegated from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]].\n\nIn 2005, [[Copenhagen]] hosted [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]], an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary.\n\nSince the introduction of semifinals in 2004, Denmark has qualified for the final on eleven out of 15 occasions. Another string of successful participations started in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]], when Denmark reached the top five for the first time in nine years, finishing fourth with \"In a Moment Like This\" performed by Chan\u00e9e and n'evergreen. A year later, Denmark finished fifth with \"New Tomorrow\" performed by the band A Friend In London, and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], Denmark won the contest for the third time, when [[Emmelie de Forest]] represented the country with the song \"[[Only Teardrops]]\", winning with Denmark's highest-ever score of 281 points.\n\nIn 2014, Denmark reached the top ten for the fourth time in five years, when [[Basim (singer)|Basim]] finished ninth. However, the success did not continue into 2015 and 2016, as Denmark failed to qualify for the grand finals in those years. In 2017, the country returned to the final, finishing 20th with Anja Nissen.

Having competed in ten consecutive contests until {{Escyr|1966}}, Denmark was absent for eleven consecutive contests from {{Escyr|1967}} to {{Escyr|1977}}. Since {{Escyr|1978}}, it has been absent from only four contests. Denmark has won the contest three times: in {{Escyr|1963}}, {{Escyr|2000}} and {{Escyr|2013}}. The Danish national selection for the contest is the [[Dansk Melodi Grand Prix]].\n\nDenmark finished third on its debut in {{escyr|1957}} with [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], before winning the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]] with the song \"[[Dansevise]]\" performed by [[Grethe & J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]]. The country returned to the top three 25 years later, with third-place finishes for [[Hot Eyes]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988]] and [[Birthe Kj\u00e6r]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]], while Denmark's only top five result of the 1990s was [[Aud Wilken]]'s fifth place in {{escyr|1995}}.\n\nDenmark won the contest for the second time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] with the [[Olsen Brothers]] and the song \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". Denmark then finished second as hosts in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]] with \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\" performed by [[Rollo & King]], before [[Malene Mortensen]] became the first Danish entry to finish last in {{escyr|2002}}. Denmark won the contest for the third time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], with [[Only Teardrops]] performed by [[Emmelie de Forest]]. Denmark has placed in the top five 14 times.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Denmark's debut ===\nDenmark first participated at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957]], held in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. The country had intended to compete at the first contest in 1956, but had submitted its application past the deadline and was, therefore, not allowed to compete. Denmark was the first [[Nordic country]] to take part in the contest, with [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]] following soon after. [[Iceland]], however, did not take part until 1986.\n\nDenmark's first participants were [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], who sang the song \"[[Skibet skal sejle i nat]]\" ({{lang-en|The Ship Will Be Leaving Tonight}}). Their performance was controversial as, at the end of the song, the couple performed an 11-second kiss, which caused outcry in some countries. Nevertheless, the performance achieved third place.\n\n=== First victory ===\nDenmark won the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], when [[Grethe Ingmann|Grethe]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]] sang \"[[Dansevise]]\" (Dance Ballad). The victory, however, was controversial. When Norway announced its votes, the presenter [[Katie Boyle]] could not hear the spokesperson and said that she would call them again later. Viewers around Europe, however, did hear the Norwegian spokesperson, and when Boyle called the Norwegian spokesperson again, the votes had been changed, changing the outcome of the contest and giving the victory to Denmark at the expense of [[Switzerland]]. In fact, the reason why Norway had to announce its votes again was that the Norwegian spokesperson did not follow the right procedure the first time and, therefore, there was doubt whether he gave the correct votes on the first occasion.\n\nThe final result was valid and the victory went to Denmark. Accordingly, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]], the contest was held in Denmark for the first time.\n\n=== Absence and return ===\nAfter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 contest]] and a record low 14th place, Denmark withdrew from the contest, as DR\u00b4s new head of entertainment Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaiser did not view the contest as being quality entertainment. Dansk Melodi Grand Prix was not held from that year onwards.\n\nHowever, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978 contest]], after 11 years' absence, and following Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaisers departure from DR, Denmark returned to the contest, represented by [[Mabel (band)|Mabel]] and the song \"[[Boom Boom (Mabel song)|Boom Boom]]\".\n\n=== Success ===\nDenmark's most successful time at the contest came between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]], with the country reaching the top eight in six out of seven contests, including four top-five placings. The duo of [[Hot Eyes]] represented the nation three times during this period. In 1984, they sang the song \"[[Det' lige det]]\" (That's Just It) and finished fourth. In 1985, they became the first and, as of 2018 only act to represent Denmark in two consecutive years. Singing \"[[Sku' du sp\u00f8rg' fra no'en?]]\" (What Business Is It Of Yours?), they could not repeat their success of the previous year and came 11th. In 1988, Hot Eyes represented Denmark again with \"[[Ka' du se hva' jeg sa'?]]\" (Didn't I Tell You So?). The duo scored its best result to date, finishing in third place, losing only to [[Celine Dion]] and [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]]. Denmark's other good results during this time were sixth place for [[Lise Haavik]] in 1986, fifth for [[Anne-Cathrine Herdorf]] & Bandjo in 1987, third for [[Birthe Kjaer]] in 1989 and eighth for [[Lonnie Devantier]] in 1990.\n\n=== Denmark's fall ===\nAfter 1990, Denmark fell from its high positions of the 1980s and was relegated from the contest on three occasions in the 1990s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]], [[Tommy Seebach]], who had previously represented Denmark in 1979 and 1981, finished 22nd, resulting Denmark being relegated from the contest in 1994. [[Aud Wilken]] sang \"[[Fra Mols til Skagen]]\" for the nation at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] and came 5th, but this high placing could not be repeated in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]], as Denmark's entry, \"Kun med dig\" sung by Dorthe Andersen and Martin Loft, did not qualify from the pre-qualifying round of the contest. In 1998, Denmark was once again relegated from the contest following a poor result in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]].\n\n=== Return to success in the 2000s ===\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]], the abolition of the language rule, which had required all countries to sing in their official languages, brought a return to success for Denmark, when [[Michael Teschl]] and [[Trine Jepsen]] finished 8th with \"[[This Time I Mean It]]\".\n\nA year later, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], Denmark would go on to win the contest again, with brothers [[Olsen Brothers|J\u00f8rgen and Niels Olsen]] defying the odds (they were considerably older than their competitors and only one male duo had won before), to win with \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". The song went on to enjoy huge success around Europe.\n\nAt the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 contest]], held in [[Copenhagen]], [[Rollo & King]] came second with the song \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\". However, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]], despite being a favourite to win the contest, [[Malene Mortensen]] came 24th (last) with \"[[Tell Me Who You Are (Malene song)|Tell Me Who You Are]]\", giving Denmark its worst result ever. Therefore, Denmark was relegated from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]].\n\nIn 2005, [[Copenhagen]] hosted [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]], an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary.\n\nSince the introduction of semifinals in 2004, Denmark has qualified for the final on eleven out of 15 occasions. Another string of successful participations started in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]], when Denmark reached the top five for the first time in nine years, finishing fourth with \"In a Moment Like This\" performed by Chan\u00e9e and n'evergreen. A year later, Denmark finished fifth with \"New Tomorrow\" performed by the band A Friend In London, and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], Denmark won the contest for the third time, when [[Emmelie de Forest]] represented the country with the song \"[[Only Teardrops]]\", winning with Denmark's highest-ever score of 281 points.\n\nIn 2014, Denmark reached the top ten for the fourth time in five years, when [[Basim (singer)|Basim]] finished ninth. However, the success did not continue into 2015 and 2016, as Denmark failed to qualify for the grand finals in those years. In 2017, the country returned to the final, finishing 20th with Anja Nissen. Denmark achieved its fifth top ten result of the decade in 2018, with [[Rasmussen (singer)|Rasmussen]] and the song \"[[Higher Ground (Rasmussen song)|Higher Ground]]\" finishing ninth.

Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7.

Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.
