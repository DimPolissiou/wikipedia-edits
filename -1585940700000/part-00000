Political and military examples of [[Below the line (advertising)|below-the-line]] (BTL) advergames include [[recruitment tool]]s like ''[[America's Army]]'', intended to boost recruitment for the [[United States Army]], and ''[[Special Force (Hezbollah)|Special Force]]'', intended to promote [[Muslim]] resistance to the state of [[Israel]]. Educational advergaming is closely related to the [[Serious game]]s initiative and falls under either [[Serious game#Classifications and subsets of serious games|Edumarket gaming]] or [[edutainment]].

In games such as ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', ''[[Year Zero (game)|Year Zero]]'', ''[[I Love Bees]]'', and ''[[Lost Experience]]'', URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to complete the game, but make for a fuller story for fans. Websites of this nature often lead players on to other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games the label \"link-chases.\" The tradeoff for TTL advertisers is that though use of the internet to find out extra things about a game might be enjoyable, gamers will not enjoy being given too much of a run-around with too obtrusive advertising to obtain important details about the game. In another form, the URL might be  part of a stage where a player can see it but it does not affect the plot. For example, in Super Monkey Ball 2, there is a stage where you can see clearly written on an obstacle a URL and the stage's name is even the word URL.\n\n== Industry impact ==\n\n=== Prevalence and efficacy ===\nIn 2019, a survey conducted by [[deltaDNA]] found that 94% of free-to-play video game developers incorporate some form of in-game advertising.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/72228/deltadna-in-game-advertising-study-2019/|title=94% of mobile devs use ads in their free-to-play games: deltaDNA's in-game advertising study 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Pocket Gamer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Among those, the most common type of advertisement were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn in-game prizes.<ref name=\":23\" /> Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products and 18% more likely to make in-app purchases when shown rewarded videos instead of forced advertising.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/news-and-insights/how-do-gamers-feel-about-advertising|title=Game On: How do gamers feel about advertising?|last=Zins|first=Amelia|date=2017-08-22|website=facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe reaction to in-game advertising has been overall positive, with 73% of players being happy with ad-funded games.<ref name=\":24\" />\n\nThe effectiveness of advertising in video games is debated by scholars.<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Effectiveness of \"in-Game\" Advertising: Comparing College Students' Explicit and Implicit Memory for Brand Names|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/JOA0091-3367350410?journalCode=ujoa20|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Player performance and in game advertising retention|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220982765_Player_performance_and_in_game_advertising_retention|journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Exploring Player Responses towards In-Game Advertising: The Impact of Interactivity|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8511151/file/8551807.pdf|journal=Ghent University Academic Bibliography|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Brand name recognition in sports game has been shown to be low among college students, although players did retain fragments of the brand names.<ref name=\":26\" /> Another study found that 35% of players could recall advertised brands in car racing games.<ref name=\":27\" /> Interactive in-game advertisements, such as brand products that are used in game, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as posters or billboards.<ref name=\":28\" />\n\n=== Mobile ===\nMobile in-game advertisements are [[Advertising|advertisements]] within [[Mobile game|mobile games]] that lead the user to the website or installation page of the advertised product or software upon being clicked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mobile-advertising.asp|title=What Is Mobile Advertising?|last=Kenton|first=Will|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Mobile gaming advertisements can take different forms, including [[banner ads]], [[Pop-up ad|pop-up ads]], [[Video advertising|video ads]], and interactive ads.

The first floppy disk advergames were developed to serve dual purposes\u2014as promotional incentives that drive response and as media that deliver awareness. American Home Foods [[Chef Boyardee]] issued one of the earliest floppy-disk advergames.<ref name=\"gamedaily2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1|title=Dunkin' for Advergames|author=Justin Davis|date=2006-01-16|publisher=Gamedaily.com|accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> Some brands, like [[Kool-Aid]] and [[Pepsi]], created early advergames on gaming platforms. They created advergames for the Atari 2600 and gave out promotional copies.<ref name=\":19\" /> The first in-box CD-ROM cereal box advergames are General Mills's ''[[Chex Quest]]'' (promoting the [[Chex]] brand) and General Mills's ''All-Star baseball'' (starring Trix Rabbit and his friends playing baseball against [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] teams and stars).\n\nCommercial examples are numerous and include advergames funded by [[Pepsi]], [[7 Up]], [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Formula One]], and [[Burger King]]. Political and military examples of [[Below the line (advertising)|below-the-line]] (BTL) advergames include [[recruitment tool]]s like ''[[America's Army]]'', intended to boost recruitment for the [[United States Army]], and ''[[Special Force (Hezbollah)|Special Force]]'', intended to promote [[Muslim]] resistance to the state of [[Israel]]. Educational advergaming is closely related to the [[Serious game]]s initiative and falls under either [[Serious game#Classifications and subsets of serious games|Edumarket gaming]] or [[edutainment]]. Examples include ''[[Food Force]]'' (made by the [[United Nations]]'s World Food Program) and ''[[Urban Jungle]]'', an educational traffic simulation.\n\n===Through-the-line advertising===\n[[File:ILoveBees - Homepage.png|thumb|300px|''[[I Love Bees]]'' makes use of \"link-chasing\" and is designed to foster [[viral marketing]].]]\nExamples of [[Through the line|through-the-line]] (TTL) advertising in games include \"link-chases,\" [[Alternate reality games|ARG]]s, and [[viral marketing]].\n\nA rare form of advertising in video games, TTL marketing in games involve the use of [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] [[hyperlink]]s within the game designed to induce the player to visit a webpage which then contains BTL advertisements. The technique used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from game to game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business2community.com/marketing/everything-need-know-atl-btl-ttl-advertising-01902793|title=Everything You Need to Know About ATL, BTL and TTL Advertising|work=Business 2 Community|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref> In games like ''[[Pikmin 2]]'', the player is given a cryptic message with an accompanying URL designed to pique the curiosity of the player. In games such as ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', ''[[Year Zero (game)|Year Zero]]'', ''[[I Love Bees]]'', and ''[[Lost Experience]]'', URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link given in the game. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to complete the game, but make for a fuller story for fans. Websites of this nature often lead players on to other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games the label \"link-chases.\" The tradeoff for TTL advertisers is that though use of the internet to find out extra things about a game might be enjoyable, gamers will not enjoy being given too much of a run-around with too obtrusive advertising to obtain important details about the game. In another form, the URL might be  part of a stage where a player can see it but it does not affect the plot. For example, in Super Monkey Ball 2, there is a stage where you can see clearly written on an obstacle a URL and the stage's name is even the word URL.\n\n== Industry impact ==\n\n=== Prevalence and efficacy ===\nIn 2019, a survey conducted by [[deltaDNA]] found that 94% of free-to-play video game developers incorporate some form of in-game advertising.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/72228/deltadna-in-game-advertising-study-2019/|title=94% of mobile devs use ads in their free-to-play games: deltaDNA's in-game advertising study 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Pocket Gamer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Among those, the most common type of advertisement were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn in-game prizes.<ref name=\":23\" /> Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products and 18% more likely to make in-app purchases when shown rewarded videos instead of forced advertising.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/news-and-insights/how-do-gamers-feel-about-advertising|title=Game On: How do gamers feel about advertising?|last=Zins|first=Amelia|date=2017-08-22|website=facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe reaction to in-game advertising has been overall positive, with 73% of players being happy with ad-funded games.<ref name=\":24\" />\n\nThe effectiveness of advertising in video games is debated by scholars.<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Effectiveness of \"in-Game\" Advertising: Comparing College Students' Explicit and Implicit Memory for Brand Names|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/JOA0091-3367350410?journalCode=ujoa20|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Player performance and in game advertising retention|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220982765_Player_performance_and_in_game_advertising_retention|journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Exploring Player Responses towards In-Game Advertising: The Impact of Interactivity|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8511151/file/8551807.pdf|journal=Ghent University Academic Bibliography|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Brand name recognition in sports game has been shown to be low among college students, although players did retain fragments of the brand names.<ref name=\":26\" /> Another study found that 35% of players could recall advertised brands in car racing games.<ref name=\":27\" /> Interactive in-game advertisements, such as brand products that are used in game, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as posters or billboards.<ref name=\":28\" />\n\n=== Mobile ===\nMobile in-game advertisements are [[Advertising|advertisements]] within [[Mobile game|mobile games]] that lead the user to the website or installation page of the advertised product or software upon being clicked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mobile-advertising.asp|title=What Is Mobile Advertising?|last=Kenton|first=Will|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Mobile gaming advertisements can take different forms, including [[banner ads]], [[Pop-up ad|pop-up ads]], [[Video advertising|video ads]], and interactive ads.

Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]). Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas) and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s. The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]]. [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210\">{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly {{convert|400|km}}. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name=\"CECorridor\">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===== Calgary\u2013Edmonton rivalry =====\n{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}\nSeeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the \"Oil Capital of Canada\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\n\nAlberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.\n\nA comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).\n\n==Employment==\nAlberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Job market trends and profiles |work=Alberta| access-date = September 9, 2019| date = 2018| url = https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190909182248/https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-09-09 }}</ref> Primary industries are also of great importance, however.\n\nBy March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%\u2014<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> its \"highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province\u2019s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.\"<ref name=\"finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11\">{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314172259/http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | archive-date=March 14, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.<ref name=\"financealberta_2016_Feb\">{{cite report | url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-3rd-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf#page=12 | title=2015\u201316 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | publisher=Department of Finance, Government of Alberta | date=February 2016 | accessdate=16 March 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |pages=15}}</ref>{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015\u201325,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.<ref name=\"huffington_2015\">{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n\nAlberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,<ref name=\"Firzli\"/> with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/> The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] \"[[fracking]]\" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/><ref name=\"NYT_2014\">{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry (2017)<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\">{{cite report |series=Industry Profiles 2018 |title=Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry |url=https://work.alberta.ca/documents/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |date=February 2018 |isbn=978-1-4601-3781-9 |issn= 2292-8960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909194936/https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f5a3586b-9fad-47a5-8741-e46cf5008d16/resource/9b026daf-1045-49bb-aad6-34996db59914/download/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!Alberta\n!Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry \n|-\n|Employment ||2,286,900 ||140,300 \n|-\n|Employment Share ||N/A ||6.1% \n|-\n|Unemployment ||194,700 ||8,800 \n|-\n|Unemployment rate ||7.8% ||5.9%\n|} \n*Data Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, CANSIM Table 282\u20130008, 2017 \"Employment share is obtained by dividing the number of employment in this industry by total employment in Alberta.\"<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\"/>\n\n====Natural gas====\n[[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion.

Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used. [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]]. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy.

Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market.

Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]). Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas) and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s. The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]]. [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref name=\"edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210\">{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly {{convert|400|km}}. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name=\"CECorridor\">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===== Calgary\u2013Edmonton rivalry =====\n{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}\nSeeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the \"Oil Capital of Canada\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\n\nAlberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.\n\nA comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).\n\n==Employment==\nAlberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Job market trends and profiles |work=Alberta| access-date = September 9, 2019| date = 2018| url = https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190909182248/https://www.alberta.ca/job-market-trends-profiles.aspx | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-09-09 }}</ref> Primary industries are also of great importance, however.\n\nBy March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%\u2014<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> its \"highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province\u2019s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.\"<ref name=\"finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11\">{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314172259/http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | archive-date=March 14, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.<ref name=\"financealberta_2016_Feb\">{{cite report | url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/quarterly/2015/2015-16-3rd-Quarter-Fiscal-Update.pdf#page=12 | title=2015\u201316 Third Quarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement | publisher=Department of Finance, Government of Alberta | date=February 2016 | accessdate=16 March 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |pages=15}}</ref>{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015\u201325,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.<ref name=\"huffington_2015\">{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nThe [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.\n\nAlberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,<ref name=\"Firzli\"/> with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/> The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] \"[[fracking]]\" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.<ref name=\"G&M_Deloitte_2016\"/><ref name=\"reuters_2016_Feb16\"/><ref name=\"fortune_2016\"/><ref name=\"NYT_2014\">{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry (2017)<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\">{{cite report |series=Industry Profiles 2018 |title=Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry |url=https://work.alberta.ca/documents/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |date=February 2018 |isbn=978-1-4601-3781-9 |issn= 2292-8960 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909194936/https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f5a3586b-9fad-47a5-8741-e46cf5008d16/resource/9b026daf-1045-49bb-aad6-34996db59914/download/industry-profile-mining-oil-and-gas-extraction.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!Alberta\n!Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry \n|-\n|Employment ||2,286,900 ||140,300 \n|-\n|Employment Share ||N/A ||6.1% \n|-\n|Unemployment ||194,700 ||8,800 \n|-\n|Unemployment rate ||7.8% ||5.9%\n|} \n*Data Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, CANSIM Table 282\u20130008, 2017 \"Employment share is obtained by dividing the number of employment in this industry by total employment in Alberta.\"<ref name=\"GOV_AB_Profile_Extraction_2018\"/>\n\n====Natural gas====\n[[Natural gas]] has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids ([[ethane]], [[propane]], and [[butane]]s) totalled {{convert|172.8|Moilbbl}}, valued at $2.27 billion.

Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used. [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]]. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy.

Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market.

In light of the ethnic and religious [[Demographics of Nigeria|divisions of Nigeria]], plans had been devised since Nigeria's independence to have its capital in a place deemed neutral to all major ethnic parties, and also in close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early 1970s as it signified neutrality and national unity. Another impetus for Abuja came because of [[Lagos]]' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid. As Lagos was already undergoing rapid economic development, the Nigerian regime felt the need to expand the economy towards the inner part of the country, and hence decided to move its capital to Abuja.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/574434-nigeriaat55-top-5-reasons-nigerias-capital-moved-lagos-abuja-photos.html|title=#NigeriaAt55: Top 5 Reasons Nigeria's Capital Was Moved From Lagos To Abuja (PHOTOS)|first=Omotayo|last=Yusuf|date=1 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref> The logic used was similar to the way [[Brazil]] planned its capital, [[Bras\u00edlia]].

The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are visible in its current form.

The FCT experiences three weather conditions annually. This includes a warm, humid [[rainy season]] and a blistering [[dry season]]. In between the two, there is a brief interlude of [[harmattan]] occasioned by the northeast trade wind, with the main feature of [[Haze|dust haze]] and dryness.\n\nThe rainy season begins from April and ends in October, when daytime temperatures reach {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}  and nighttime lows hover around {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} to {{convert|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. In the dry season, daytime temperatures can soar as high as {{convert|40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} and nighttime temperatures can dip to {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. Even the chilliest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. The high altitudes and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory. The city's inland location causes the [[diurnal temperature variation]] to be much larger than coastal cities with similar climates such as [[Lagos]].\n\nRainfall in the FCT reflects the territory's location on the windward side of the [[Jos Plateau]] and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from April to October every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touristlink.com/nigeria/abuja/overview.html |title=Abuja Nigeria Tourist Information |publisher=Touristlink.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Abuja\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 34.7\n| Feb high C = 36.8\n| Mar high C = 36.9\n| Apr high C = 35.6\n| May high C = 32.7\n| Jun high C = 30.6\n| Jul high C = 29.1\n| Aug high C = 28.9\n| Sep high C = 30.0\n| Oct high C = 32.0\n| Nov high C = 34.4\n| Dec high C = 34.6\n| year high C =\n| Jan low C = 20.4\n| Feb low C = 25.5\n| Mar low C = 24.3\n| Apr low C = 24.7\n| May low C = 19.5\n| Jun low C = 18.3\n| Jul low C = 21.9\n| Aug low C = 17.7\n| Sep low C = 17.5\n| Oct low C = 21.4\n| Nov low C = 15.7\n| Dec low C = 15.5\n| year low C =\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 1.7\n| Feb rain mm = 5.4\n| Mar rain mm = 11.3\n| Apr rain mm = 62.8\n| May rain mm = 134.1\n| Jun rain mm = 164.2\n| Jul rain mm = 217.5\n| Aug rain mm = 262.7\n| Sep rain mm = 253.4\n| Oct rain mm = 103.2\n| Nov rain mm = 3.7\n| Dec rain mm = 1.2\n| year rain mm =\n| Jan rain days = 0.1\n| Feb rain days = 0.2\n| Mar rain days = 1.3\n| Apr rain days = 4.2\n| May rain days = 9.4\n| Jun rain days = 12.3\n| Jul rain days = 14.0\n| Aug rain days = 16.2\n| Sep rain days = 15.9\n| Oct rain days = 8.0\n| Nov rain days = 0.3\n| Dec rain days = 0.1\n| source 1 = World Meteorological Organization.<ref name=\"WMO\">[http://worldweather.wmo.int/075/c00324.htm World Weather Information Service-Abuja], World Meteorological Organization.

Each Phase is separated from the other by an expressway (some still under construction); for example, Phases 1 and 2 are separated from each other by the Nnamdi Azikiwe expressway, while the entirety of the city proper (Phases 1-5) are enclosed by the Murtala Muhammed (Outer Northern-ONEX and Outer Southern-OSEX) expressways as well as the Federal A2 highway which traverses the Federal Capital Territory on its way to Kaduna (north-bound) and Lokoja (south-bound). Thus there is an integration of the city's road network with the Federal highway network, providing access to the immediate outlying countryside and the surrounding states of the country i.e. Niger State to the west, Kaduna State to the north, Nasarawa State to the east and Kogi State to the south.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Phase 1 area of the city is divided into ten districts known as [[cadastre|cadastral]] zones.<ref name=\"abuja-ng.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abuja-ng.com/contactus.html|title=Contact Us|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Central District, Abuja|Central Cadastral Zone A00]]\n* [[Garki I District Cadastral Zone A01]]\n* [[Wuse 1 District Cadastral Zone A02]] \n* [[Garki II District Cadastral Zone A03]]\n* [[Asokoro District, Abuja|Asokoro Cadastral Zone A04]]\n* [[Maitama District Cadastral Zone A05 & A06]]\n* [[Wuse II Districts (Cadastral Zone A07 & Cadastral Zone A08)]]\n* [[Guzape District Cadastral Zone A09]]\n\nThere are also sixteen districts in Phase 2.<ref name=\"abuja-ng.com\"/>{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Kukwuaba District, Abuja|Kukwuaba Cadastral Zone B00]]\n* [[Gudu District, Abuja|Gudu Cadastral Zone B01]]\n*[[Durumi District, Abuja|Durumi Cadastral Zone B02]]\n* [[Wuye District, Abuja|Wuye Cadastral Zone B03]]\n* [[Jabi District, Abuja|Jabi Cadastral Zone B04]]\n* [[Utako District, Abuja|Utako Cadastral Zone B05]]\n* [[Mabuchi District, Abuja|Mabuchi Cadastral Zone B06]]\n* [[Jahi District, Abuja|Jahi Cadastral Zone B08]]\n* [[Kado District, Abuja|Kado Cadastral Zone B09]]\n* [[Dakibiyu District, Abuja|Dakibiyu Cadastral Zone B10]]\n* [[Kaura District, Abuja|Kaura Cadastral Zone B11]]\n* [[Duboyi District, Abuja|Duboyi Cadastral Zone B12]]\n* [[Gaduwa District, Abuja|Gaduwa Cadastral Zone B13]]\n* [[Dutse District, Abuja|Dutse Cadastral Zone B14]]\n* [[Katampe Ext District, Abuja|Katampe Ext Cadastral Zone B19]] \n\nThere are eleven districts in Phase 3.<ref name=\"abuja-ng.com\"/>{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Institution and Research District, Abuja|Institution and Research Cadastral Zone C00]]\n* [[Karmo District, Abuja|Karmo Cadastral Zone C01]]\n* [[Gwarimpa District, Abuja|Gwarimpa Cadastral Zone C02]]\n* [[Dape District, Abuja|Dape Cadastral Zone C04]]\n* [[Kafe District, Abuja|Kafe Cadastral Zone C05]]\n* [[Nbora District, Abuja|Nbora Cadastral Zone C06]]\n* [[Galadimawa District, Abuja|Galadimawa Cadastral Zone C07]]\n* [[Dakwo District, Abuja|Dakwo Cadastral Zone C08]]\n* [[Lokogoma District, Abuja|Lokogoma Cadastral Zone C09]]\n* [[Wumba District, Abuja|Wumba Cadastral Zone C10]]\n* [[Idu Industrial District, Abuja|Idu Industrial Cadastral Zone C16]]\n\nThere are five suburban districts: [[Nyanya Suburban District, Abuja|Nyanya]], [[Karu Suburban District, Abuja|Karu]], [[Gwagwalada Suburban District, Abuja|Gwagwalada]], [[Kubwa, Abuja|Kubwa]], and [[Jukwoyi Suburban Disrict|Jukwoyi]].

While each district has its own clearly demarcated commercial and residential sectors, the Central District is the city's principal Business Zone, where practically all parastatals and [[multinational corporations]] have their offices. An attractive area in the Central District is the region known as the '''Three Arms Zone''', so called because it houses the administrative offices of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government. A few of the other sites worth seeing in the area are the federal secretariats alongside Shehu Shagari Way, Aso Hill, the Abuja Plant Nursery, [[Eagle Square (Abuja)|Eagle Square]] (which has important historic significance, as it was in this grounds that the present democratic dispensation had its origin on 29 May 1999) and in which all subsequent Presidential Inauguration ceremonies have taken place. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated across Shehu Shagari Way facing the Eagle Square.

The district is subdivided into units called \"Areas\". Garki uses a distinctive naming convention of \"Area\" to refer to parts of Garki. These are designated as Areas 1 to 11. Garki II is used to differentiate the area from Garki Area 2.  Visitors may find this system confusing.\n\nGarki is presently the principal business and administrative district of Abuja. Numerous buildings of interest are in this area. Some of them include the General Post Office, Abuja International Conference Centre along the busy Herbert Maculay Way, Nicon Luxury Hotel (formally known as Abuja Sofitel Hotel and Le Meridian), Agura Hotel and Old Federal Secretariat Complex Buildings (Area 1). A new five-star hotel, Hawthorn Suites Abuja, is in Garki.\n\nArea 2 is mainly used for residential purposes, although a zoological garden as well as a small shopping Centre are to be found here as well. Several banks and other commercial offices are located along Moshood Abiola Way in Area 7. The headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces \u2013 Army, Airforce and Navy \u2013 is located on Muhammadu Buhari Way in the Garki District.\n\nThe tallest building in this district is the Radio House located at the Area 11 sector, which houses the Federal Ministry of Information and Communications, the [[Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria]] (FRCN) and Voice of Nigeria (VON). The [[Nigerian Television Authority]] (NTA) stations and corporate headquarters are also in Garki. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) which oversees and runs the Administration of the Federal Capital Territory has its offices in Garki.\n\nThe Office of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja is in Area 11. This is the location of the Federal Capital Development Authority and other administrative buildings. A popular sub-neighbourhood here is found in the vicinity of Gimbiya street, because it has the unique characteristic of being a purely administrative zone on weekdays, while transforming into a purely entertainment zone on weeknights and weekends.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[File:CityCentremall.jpg|thumb|A community shopping centre located in Garki Area 11.]]\n\nOther places of note include the Cyprian Ekwensi Arts & Culture Centre and The Nigerian Police Mobile Force CID (Criminal Investigation Department) headquarters in Area 10. The Abuja Municipal Area Council, which is the local government administration has its headquarters in Area 10. The new United States Embassy is in the Diplomatic Zone which adjoins Garki.\n\n===Wuse District===\n{{unsourced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Wuse District, Abuja|Wuse District]] is the northwestern part of the city, with the Maitama District to its north and the Central District to its south. The District is numbered Zones 1\u20136. The Wuse Market is Abuja's principal market. The second most important post office in the city is here. This district houses the Sheraton Hotel and Towers (Zone 4), Grand Ibro International hotel, the Federal Road Safety Corps Headquarters (Zone 3), Nigerian Customs Services Headquarters, Federal Civil Service Commission (Zone 3), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration (NAFDAC) (Zone 7), Wuse General Hospital, and the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation. Just as Garki District has Garki II, Wuse has Wuse II. This is distinct from Wuse Zone 2.\n\n===Maitama District===\n{{unsourced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Millennium Park Abuja1.jpg|thumbnail|[[Millennium Park (Abuja)|Millennium Park]] in Maitama District]]\n[[Maitama District, Abuja|Maitama District]] is to the north of the city, with the Wuse and Central Districts lying to its southwest and southeast respectively. This area is home to the top bracket sections of society and business, and has the reputation of being very exclusive and very expensive. Interesting buildings include the [[Transcorp Hilton Hotel]], [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] Headquarters (NCC), [[National Universities Commission]] (NUC), Soil Conservation Complex, and [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] (INEC). The British High Commission is located along [[Aguiyi Ironsi]] Way, in Maitama. Also, the Maitama District Hospital is another notable building in Maitama. Maitama District is home to many of the European and Asian embassies.\n\n===Asokoro District===\n{{unsourced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Asokoro District, Abuja|Asokoro District]], the [[doyen]] of the districts, houses all of the state's lodges/guest houses. The ECOWAS secretariat is a focal point of interest. Asokoro is to the east of Garki District and south of Central District. It is one of the most exclusive districts of Abuja and houses virtually all of the federal cabinet ministers as well as most of the diplomatic community in the city; in addition, the Presidential Palace (commonly referred to as the Aso Rock) is in Asokoro District. By virtue of this fact, Asokoro is the most secure area of the city.\n\n=== Jabi District ===\nJabi is a developed district in phase 2 of Abuja. It is both residential and commercial in nature. The residential parts of the district are peaceful with streets of large gated houses being a prominent feature. The more commercial parts of the area are significantly busier. The district plays host to the Jabi Lake, which sits by the Jabi Lake Mall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villaafrika.com/jabi-district-guide/|title=Jabi Abuja {{!}} District Guide {{!}} Real Estate \u2013 Villa Afrika|website=Villa Afrika Realty|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n\n===Gwarimpa District===\n\n[[Gwarimpa District, Abuja|Gwarimpa]] is the last district in the Abuja Municipal Area Council.

In light of the ethnic and religious [[Demographics of Nigeria|divisions of Nigeria]], plans had been devised since Nigeria's independence to have its capital in a place deemed neutral to all major ethnic parties, and also in close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early 1970s as it signified neutrality and national unity. Another impetus for Abuja came because of [[Lagos]]' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid. As Lagos was already undergoing rapid economic development, the Nigerian regime felt the need to expand the economy towards the inner part of the country, and hence decided to move its capital to Abuja.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/574434-nigeriaat55-top-5-reasons-nigerias-capital-moved-lagos-abuja-photos.html|title=#NigeriaAt55: Top 5 Reasons Nigeria's Capital Was Moved From Lagos To Abuja (PHOTOS)|first=Omotayo|last=Yusuf|date=1 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref> The logic used was similar to the way [[Brazil]] planned its capital, [[Bras\u00edlia]].

While each district has its own clearly demarcated commercial and residential sectors, the Central District is the city's principal Business Zone, where practically all parastatals and [[multinational corporations]] have their offices. An attractive area in the Central District is the region known as the '''Three Arms Zone''', so called because it houses the administrative offices of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government. A few of the other sites worth seeing in the area are the federal secretariats alongside Shehu Shagari Way, Aso Hill, the Abuja Plant Nursery, [[Eagle Square (Abuja)|Eagle Square]] (which has important historic significance, as it was in this grounds that the present democratic dispensation had its origin on 29 May 1999) and in which all subsequent Presidential Inauguration ceremonies have taken place. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated across Shehu Shagari Way facing the Eagle Square. This section is usually closed to traffic during the annual Armed Forces Remembrance Day ceremonies that is observed on 15 January.

The district is subdivided into units called \"Areas\". Garki uses a distinctive naming convention of \"Area\" to refer to parts of Garki. These are designated as Areas 1 to 11. Garki II is used to differentiate the area from Garki Area 2.  Visitors may find this system confusing.\n\nGarki is presently the principal business and administrative district of Abuja. Numerous buildings of interest are in this area. Some of them include the General Post Office, Abuja International Conference Centre along the busy Herbert Maculay Way, Nicon Luxury Hotel (formally known as Abuja Sofitel Hotel and Le Meridian), Agura Hotel and Old Federal Secretariat Complex Buildings (Area 1). A new five-star hotel, Hawthorn Suites Abuja, is in Garki.\n\nArea 2 is mainly used for residential purposes, although a zoological garden as well as a small shopping Centre are to be found here as well. Several banks and other commercial offices are located along Moshood Abiola Way in Area 7. The headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces \u2013 Army, Airforce and Navy \u2013 is located on Muhammadu Buhari Way in the Garki District.\n\nThe tallest building in this district is the Radio House located at the Area 11 sector, which houses the Federal Ministry of Information and Communications, the [[Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria]] (FRCN) and Voice of Nigeria (VON). The [[Nigerian Television Authority]] (NTA) stations and corporate headquarters are also in Garki. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) which oversees and runs the Administration of the Federal Capital Territory has its offices in Garki.\n\nThe Office of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja is in Area 11. This is the location of the Federal Capital Development Authority and other administrative buildings. A popular sub-neighbourhood here is found in the vicinity of Gimbiya street, because it has the unique characteristic of being a purely administrative zone on weekdays, while transforming into a purely entertainment zone on weeknights and weekends.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[File:CityCentremall.jpg|thumb|A community shopping centre located in Garki Area 11.]]\n\nOther places of note include the Cyprian Ekwensi Arts & Culture Centre and The Nigerian Police Mobile Force CID (Criminal Investigation Department) headquarters in Area 10.

The District is numbered Zones 1\u20136. The Wuse Market is Abuja's principal market. The second most important post office in the city is here. This district houses the Sheraton Hotel and Towers (Zone 4), Grand Ibro International hotel, the Federal Road Safety Corps Headquarters (Zone 3), Nigerian Customs Services Headquarters, Federal Civil Service Commission (Zone 3), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration (NAFDAC) (Zone 7), Wuse General Hospital, and the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation.

This area is home to the top bracket sections of society and business, and has the reputation of being very exclusive and very expensive. Interesting buildings include the [[Transcorp Hilton Hotel]], [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] Headquarters (NCC), [[National Universities Commission]] (NUC), Soil Conservation Complex, and [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] (INEC). The British High Commission is located along [[Aguiyi Ironsi]] Way, in Maitama. Also, the Maitama District Hospital is another notable building in Maitama. Maitama District is home to many of the European and Asian embassies.\n\n===Asokoro District===\n{{unsourced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Asokoro District, Abuja|Asokoro District]], the [[doyen]] of the districts, houses all of the state's lodges/guest houses. The ECOWAS secretariat is a focal point of interest. Asokoro is to the east of Garki District and south of Central District. It is one of the most exclusive districts of Abuja and houses virtually all of the federal cabinet ministers as well as most of the diplomatic community in the city; in addition, the Presidential Palace (commonly referred to as the Aso Rock) is in Asokoro District. By virtue of this fact, Asokoro is the most secure area of the city.\n\n=== Jabi District ===\nJabi is a developed district in phase 2 of Abuja. It is both residential and commercial in nature. The residential parts of the district are peaceful with streets of large gated houses being a prominent feature. The more commercial parts of the area are significantly busier.
