It was designed by City Engineers W. B. Rider and E. Bell (1856\u20131871) and the unrelated F. Bell (1871\u20131878). It is also known as Botany Swamps, Botany Wetlands, Mills Stream, Bridge Pond, Lakes Golf Course, Eastlakes Golf Course and Bonnie Doon Golf Course. The property is owned by [[Sydney Water]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 18 November 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1317>{{cite NSW SHR|5051418|Botany Water Reserves|hr=01317|fn=10/14814; H06/00076|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nOn 29 April 1770 Captain [[James Cook]] made his first landfall in Australia at [[Botany Bay]]. The botanist, [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], and his Swedish assistant, [[Daniel Solander]] from Cook's ship {{HMS|Endeavour}}, spent several days ashore collecting vast numbers of previously unknown plants. Cook was in two minds about a suitable name for the Bay \u2013 his journal first refers to it as Stingray's Harbour, then as Botanist Bay, then both were crossed out and the present Botany Bay inserted, no doubt because of Banks and Solander's work. Since its name comes from the Bay on which it stands, [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] can well claim to have the oldest English place name in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nCook's recommendation and Banks' enthusiasm were largely responsible for the British Government's decision to found a penal settlement at Botany Bay. When [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]] arrived in mid-summer in 1788 however, he found the harbour shallow and exposed, and the shore swampy and lacking sources of fresh water. As a result, the [[First Fleet]] sailed on to [[Port Jackson]], finding a more suitable site for settlement at [[Sydney Cove]].<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nBotany was first planned as an agricultural district, and the principal industry was to be market gardening. Instead it became an industrial area, boasting a fellmonger's yard and a slaughter works. As early as 1809, Mr E. Redmond came to settle in the district, but the first important developer was [[Simeon Lord]] (1771\u20131840), who built a [[fulling]] mill in 1815 on the site that later became that of the old water works. In 1823 he received a grant of {{convert|600|acre}}, followed by further grants. Part of the estate was subdivided by 1887. Lord, the \"merchant prince of Botany Bay\", manufactured fine wool cloth, and was also one of the merchants instrumental in the founding of [[Sydney Hospital]]. He gave land for the sites of two early churches in Botany, and Lord Street is named after him. Banksia Street, Sir Joseph Banks Park and Booralee Park all commemorate those early days.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe Sydney Water Works were established in Botany in 1858 and were fed by the many springs in the area. In 1886, the last year of full pumping, 1864 million gallons of water were supplied to [[Sydney]] from these water works. Although the scheme was Sydney's major source of water for 30 years, it did not supply water in the Botany area and local residents depended on natural sources and tanks.<ref name=nswshr-1317-1904>Pollen, 1988, pp.35\u20136</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFollowing European colonisation the first substantial interventions in the area occurred in 1815 when the enterprising merchant Simeon Lord had a dam constructed to the west of the present Botany Road for the purpose of establishing the colony's first woollen mill. A second dam was constructed near the present Engine House ruins for a flour mill. This mill continued operating until about 1847 while the textile factory was closed by about 1856.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFrom 13 July 1855 the [[City of Sydney|City Council]] began resuming land around, and including, the Botany wetlands for the city's main water supply scheme \u2013 the first time land resumptions were made for this purpose. (The land was transferred to the Water Board in 1888.) Of this land about 75 acres of Lord's estate was resumed which included his house (demolished in the 1930s though the site of which is in the vicinity of the present heliport), the mill sites, various cottages and the earthworks associated with Lord's mill dams.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe initial water supply scheme of the mid-1850s, by the City Engineer W. B. Rider, was abandoned with the appointment of Edward Bell to the position. The surviving Engine House and chimney date from the implementation, in the late 1850s, of Bell's scheme while the stone retaining walls for the Engine Pond and outlet sluice probably date from the 1870s work on the Engine Pond augmentation. Between 1866 and the mid-1870s six dams were constructed, and reconstructed for various reasons, from the Mill Pond to Gardeners Road using piling of sheet timber facing filled with sand forming a core of a turfed bank. In 1859 a 30\" sand-cast iron main was completed between the Engine House and the Crown Street reservoir. The pipes were made in [[Scotland]] in 1856 and machined with such remarkably fine tolerance that, of the total length of 4 miles (6.4&nbsp;km), the outside diameter varied by only 6mm and allowed the pipes to be laid without jointing material. Part of this easement coincides with the present study area in the vicinity of the Engine House.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nDrawing on a 1982 thesis of Margaret Simpson, the Thorp et al. study indicates that about 80 trees \u2013 \"Norfolk Pines, Moreton Bay Figs, Weeping Figs, Sweet Scented Pines and Stone Pines\" \u2013 were planted along the access road from Botany and elsewhere on the site in 1869. Works for the augmentation of water storage at Botany continued throughout the 1870s including the addition of water stored in the Bunnerong Dam (1876\u20131877) by way of a pipe to the No 4 Pond. The then Bunnerong Road was moved and ran along the top of this dam wall.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nBy the early 1880s the [[Upper Nepean Scheme]] was well underway and in November 1886 the Nepean-supplied water effectively ended the general supply of Sydney's water from the Botany system. Even intermittent emergency use of the system ceased by 1893 so that the Engine House machinery was finally decommissioned with pumping equipment and boilers sold at auction in 1896. In 1894 various local industrial uses \u2013 such as wool scourers and tanners \u2013 were permitted to return to the wetland vicinity through leases until 1947.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nWhile these major improvement programs for Sydney's water supply were being put into place it also became clear \u2013 chiefly from an increasingly polluted harbour \u2013 that substantial works were needed to deal with the sewage of Sydney and its immediate suburbs. After the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage was formed in 1888 the basis of what is presently Sydney's largest sewerage system was commenced. As part of its responsibilities the new Board assumed control of various recent works of the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]], one of which was the first of the new sewer mains from the City to the Botany Sewage Farm established about 1886. Another main was added in 1898 which linked various western suburbs to the Sewage Farm. However, by the turn of the century the usefulness of the Farm was fast diminishing such that the southern and western sewerage systems were amalgamated and extended, from 1909, to a new ocean outfall at [[Malabar, New South Wales|Malabar]] while the much expanded Botany Sewage Farm was closed. This work \u2013 known as the Southern and Western Sewer Ocean Outfall System or, usually, SWSOOS No 1 \u2013 was completed in 1916 under the direction of Chief Engineer EM de Burgh.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFurther growth of Sydney's suburbs and resultant extensions to this sewerage network necessitated an augmentation of the system, by duplication known as SWSOOS No 2, during 1936 to 1941. Both mains were required to cross the [[Cooks River]] by inverted syphons. The current SWSOOS network represents Sydney's largest sewerage system and envelops mains that were constructed from the 1880s through the 1890s, 1900s, 1910s to 1940s. Other individually significant components of the SWSOOS network that occur in the vicinity of the present site include the twin major inverted syphons and syphonic overflows (now under [[Sydney Airport]]) and the 1896 sewer vent at West Botany Street, [[Arncliffe, New South Wales|Arncliffe]].<ref name=nswshr-1317-1905>ID No SW 31 \u2013 SHI 4571725</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nWithin the site the existing engine house chimney was retired for water supply use in 1888, left unused for 28 years then, after being shortened, re-used as a vent in 1916 as part of the work for the new SWSOOS. Various buildings, associated with the new sewerage system, were added to the west. During the 1940s the chimney was further truncated to its present height along with the diversion of the mouth of the Cooks River into Botany Bay and substantial filling of the Engine and Mill Ponds as part of a major expansion and upgrade of airport facilities. From the 1970s a greater appreciation of the special historical and environmental values of the place was apparent through the commissioning of a range of studies to record and assess its significance. However further incursions continued with the 1988 construction of [[Southern Cross Drive]] through the middle of the Engine Pond, reclamation by the DMR and more recent works associated with the pre-Olympics upgrade of the airport.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n===The Lakes Golf Club (1928)===\n{{main|The Lakes Golf Club}}\nIn 1928 construction of a clubhouse near Gardeners Road was commenced for the Lakes Golf Club with the course \u2013 to the west and north of the chain of ponds \u2013 opening in 1930.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAbout 1960 the Eastlakes Golf Club was established with an 18-hole course on the eastern and southern side of the ponds. The neighbouring course to the northeast, [[The Australian Golf Club]], was established in 1904 and in the same year it was host for the first Australian open golf title which was won by Michael Scott. Both the Lakes and Australian golf courses have been consistently ranked in the top five golf courses in New South Wales for many years.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe Lakes Golf Club practice precinct (east of the club house) was excavated on a number of occasions from 1928 to 1970. In the early 1970s the south-eastern area of this land was bulldozed and redeveloped as part of the overall golf course design as a direct result of the state government requiring some of the golf course land to construct Southern Cross Drive. This included extensive excavation of the area of the practice precinct of the golf course. In the mid-1970s some of the practice precinct area formed part of the tennis court construction which required bulldozing the area to prepare the ground for new tennis courts. This was conducted as part of construction of the golf course clubhouse<ref name=\"nswshr-1317-1908\">Kirkman, 2016, 4</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIn the early 2000s the practice precinct was renovated as part of a plan to improve course facilities for practice, and to have the course fit with the natural contours and appearance of the sandy dunes and lakes that dominate its site. This included extensive disturbance of the practice precinct area. In 2005 a new club house was built and this resulted in removal of the tennis courts. The practice precinct and some of the driving range tee was bulldozed to remove the tennis courts and then construct the practice chipping area.<ref name=nswshr-1317-1907>Kirkman, 2016, 4\u20135</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFrom 2007\u201309 the entire Lakes Golf Course underwent a comprehensive renovation which included extensive construction works to the south-western section of the practice precinct area. This involved use of a bulldozer and other construction equipment to construct the 10th tees and the area in front of them. This included the small ridge between the driving range tee and the front of the current 10th hole tees.<ref name=\"nswshr-1317-1908\"/><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n== Description ==\nThis item consists of an extensive tract of open space/parkland, with 58 ha of wetlands, including Sydney Airport, The Australian Golf Course, Lakes Golf Course, Eastlakes Golf Course, Bonnie Doon Golf Course and Mutch Park. Other areas of wetlands in the vicinity are substantially smaller in extent \u2013 the Eve Street wetlands, Arncliffe (south of Kogarah Golf Club) and the chain of ponds in Sir Joseph Banks Park, Botany.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nImportant surviving elements of non-indigenous heritage include remnants of the water supply Engine House and [[chimney]] (late 1850s) (no longer owned by Sydney Water); spillway/weir, remnants of the Engine and Mill Ponds; the sequence of ponds between the Mill Pond and Gardeners Road; 1915 Sewer Pumphouse; twin sewer syphons and easements; partial evidence of old Cooks River edge (evident through comparing early and recent aerial photography; 1869 plantings of Norfolk Island Pines ([[Araucaria heterophylla]]), Moreton Bay Fig Trees ([[Ficus macrophylla]]) and Port Jackson Fig Trees ([[Ficus rubiginosa]]). Given the period, important government institutional use and the choice of tree species there is strong circumstantial evidence for the involvement of [[Charles Moore (botanist)|Charles Moore]] \u2013 Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens (1848\u20131896) in advising on these plantings. Canary Island Date Palms ([[Phoenix canariensis]]) also survive near the Engine Pond and may be remnants \u2013 or progeny \u2013 of 1910s plantings associated with the reuse of the site for the main southern sewer system. There is likewise strong circumstantial evidence for the involvement of [[Joseph Maiden|Joseph Henry Maiden]] \u2013 Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens (1896\u20131924) in recommending the choice of these plantings.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nA comparison of current aerial photographs and the Sydney Water Commission's 1869 topographic plan of the Lachlan Swamp from No 6 Dam to Botany Bay shows that there is a substantial degree of correlation between the layouts of many of the dams. Despite the bisection of the Engine Pond by Southern Cross Drive, it is still possible to appreciate the basic outline of the earlier pond. A similar observation holds for the former Bridge Pond as the present Mill Pond and the western half of the \"New Pond\" retain the earlier basic form. The embankment separating the Mill and New Ponds preserves part of the alignment of the old Sydney-Botany road (shown on the 1869 SWC plan) with its tollhouse site just south of the embankment. (Archaeological evidence of the former tollhouse may still exist.) The present Nos 1 and 2 Ponds closely reflect the earlier form of the 1869 No 1 Pond while most of the present Nos 3a, 3 and 4/5 Ponds almost exactly retain the earlier form of the 1869 Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5 Ponds respectively. The northern part of the old No 6 Pond has been filled. Generally, the present wetland layout retains a close indication of the original 1860s dam forms. Earlier pond formations existed some decades before, and were absorbed into, this system however surviving evidence is difficult to discern from both (non-intrusive) site inspections and an analysis of aerial photography. Archaeological investigations \u2013 if ever required \u2013 may reveal evidence of these early 19th century structures.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nA \"Plan of the Botany & Lachlan Watersheds\" signed by Francis Bell in June, 1875 shows that the Lachlan Water Supply (Centennial Park) links with the Botany Pond system as does the area of land containing the present Australian Golf Course.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nSeveral remnant areas of the famous and now rare Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub (still featuring the trademark Grass Trees ([[Xanthorrhoea resinosa]]) as well as various communities of reed and sedgeland species are represented within the open space boundaries. Other important indigenous vegetation vestiges include areas of Paperbark swamp featuring [[Melaleuca quinquenervia]], marshland and wet heath and large areas of the aquatic herb ''[[Ludwigia (plant)|Ludwigia]]''.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAs at 21 May 2004, major elements (the sequence of ponds) of Sydney's third main water supply system are substantially intact. Particular elements of the system \u2013 its architectural and planted elements \u2013 are only partially intact.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nAlthough the pre-European wetland ecosystem was modified during the 1860s and 1870s pond construction, there has been only limited major modification \u2013 mainly for the expansion of the airport and construction of new arterial roadways \u2013 since then. Major elements (the sequence of ponds) of Sydney's third main water supply system are substantially intact. Particular elements of the system \u2013 its architectural and planted elements \u2013 are only partially intact. Yet the little that remains of these are particularly poignant and serve as important local landmarks.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nBotany Water Reserve holds considerable value for Sydney and NSW because it contains the only remaining major components \u2013 substantial layout and other important physical evidence from the 1850s through to the 1870s \u2013 of the unique water supply system that supported the expansion of the Sydney metropolis for most of the latter half of the 19th century, representing Sydney's third main water supply system since colonisation; and on account of the surviving remnants of the early 19th century industries associated with the prominent emancipist merchant Simeon Lord. The site includes land which, in 1855, was the subject of the first resumptions for the purpose of a water supply system by a government in Australia. Part of the original 1850s sand-cast iron water supply pipe remains within the site representing a remnant of the State's oldest main.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThis extant remnant of the water supply system also has high collective value as important evidence likewise remains of the two principal Sydney water supply systems (The [[Tank Stream]] and [[Busby's Bore]]) that predated the Botany system along with those superseding it (The Upper Canal and regional dam systems).<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe open space areas encompassed by the item include two regionally rare and distinct remnant vegetation communities known as Sydney Freshwater Wetlands and [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]] Banksia Scrub that are both potentially of State significance and are the subject of separate listings as an Endangered Ecological Community under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The wetlands also have recognised regional ecological value as native animal habitat and movement corridors, and may include animal species of conservation significance.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe item is of regional environmental importance as a major recharge source for the Sydney basin aquifer.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIt likely holds special interest as a landmark cultural and recreational landscape for the regional community.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIt also has regional importance on account of the substantial infrastructure it contains of the 1910s Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer System<ref name=nswshr-1317-1909>SWSOOS No 1</ref>- since augmented during 1936\u20131941 by SWSOOS No 2 \u2013 representing one of the first major separate sewers in Sydney as well as incorporating new ventilation technologies. This infrastructure includes use of the former Engine House chimney as a sewer vent, the viaduct to carry the vent pipe, Sewage Pumping Station No 38 of 1916 near the Engine House ruins and part of the SWSOOS Nos 1 and 2 mains. The overall SWSOOS network remains Sydney's largest sewer system.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nBotany Water Reserves was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe item contains substantial remnants of structures and layout from Sydney's third main water supply system which supported the growth of Australia's largest city for most of the latter half of the 19th century. The 1850s water supply pipeline represents the oldest main in the State. The site contains important components of Sydney's main southern sewerage system from the 1910s and 1930s to 1940s supporting the expansion and consolidation of inner Sydney from the late 19th century to the present.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIt also demonstrates the growth in demand for golf courses throughout the 20th century with the establishment of four separate courses including the Australian (est. 1904) and the Lakes Golf Course (est. 1928) \u2013 two of the State's oldest and most highly regarded.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe place also has strong and direct associations with prominent individuals \u2013 including Colonial entrepreneur Simeon Lord; the naval officer, surveyor and pastoralist Thomas Woore; City Engineers WB Rider, Edward Bell and Francis Bell; and Board engineers including EM de Burgh. Passing, though telling, early European references to the former landscape character of the area were made by many noted travellers including Captain James Cook in 1770 and Francois Peron in 1802.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAs surviving elements of Sydney's third main water supply system it is rare if not unique.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAs a modified/remnant wetland system it is representative of a once extensive vegetation community that included sites from Jewells Swamp, near [[Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)|Lake Macquarie]] to Coomaditchy Lagoon south of Sydney, yet as remnant sites within the [[Sydney Basin]] are now only of a small size and are threatened with extinction the wetlands should be considered rare. Similarly the areas of Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub are rare \u2013 of their total estimated area at the beginning of European colonisation less than 1% remains.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nSWSOOS is rare as the largest of Sydney's sewerage networks.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAlthough the pre-European wetland ecosystem was modified during the 1860s and 1870s pond construction, there has been only limited major modification \u2013 mainly for the expansion of the airport and construction of new arterial roadways \u2013 since then. Major elements (the sequence of ponds) of Sydney's third main water supply system are substantially intact.

It was designed by City Engineers W. B. Rider and E. Bell (1856\u20131871) and the unrelated F. Bell (1871\u20131878). It is also known as Botany Swamps, Botany Wetlands, Mills Stream, Bridge Pond, Lakes Golf Course, Eastlakes Golf Course and Bonnie Doon Golf Course. The property is owned by [[Sydney Water]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 18 November 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1317>{{cite NSW SHR|5051418|Botany Water Reserves|hr=01317|fn=10/14814; H06/00076|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nOn 29 April 1770 Captain [[James Cook]] made his first landfall in Australia at [[Botany Bay]]. The botanist, [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], and his Swedish assistant, [[Daniel Solander]] from Cook's ship {{HMS|Endeavour}}, spent several days ashore collecting vast numbers of previously unknown plants. Cook was in two minds about a suitable name for the Bay \u2013 his journal first refers to it as Stingray's Harbour, then as Botanist Bay, then both were crossed out and the present Botany Bay inserted, no doubt because of Banks and Solander's work. Since its name comes from the Bay on which it stands, [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] can well claim to have the oldest English place name in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nCook's recommendation and Banks' enthusiasm were largely responsible for the British Government's decision to found a penal settlement at Botany Bay. When [[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]] arrived in mid-summer in 1788 however, he found the harbour shallow and exposed, and the shore swampy and lacking sources of fresh water. As a result, the [[First Fleet]] sailed on to [[Port Jackson]], finding a more suitable site for settlement at [[Sydney Cove]].<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nBotany was first planned as an agricultural district, and the principal industry was to be market gardening. Instead it became an industrial area, boasting a fellmonger's yard and a slaughter works. As early as 1809, Mr E. Redmond came to settle in the district, but the first important developer was [[Simeon Lord]] (1771\u20131840), who built a [[fulling]] mill in 1815 on the site that later became that of the old water works. In 1823 he received a grant of {{convert|600|acre}}, followed by further grants. Part of the estate was subdivided by 1887. Lord, the \"merchant prince of Botany Bay\", manufactured fine wool cloth, and was also one of the merchants instrumental in the founding of [[Sydney Hospital]]. He gave land for the sites of two early churches in Botany, and Lord Street is named after him. Banksia Street, Sir Joseph Banks Park and Booralee Park all commemorate those early days.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe Sydney Water Works were established in Botany in 1858 and were fed by the many springs in the area. In 1886, the last year of full pumping, 1864 million gallons of water were supplied to [[Sydney]] from these water works. Although the scheme was Sydney's major source of water for 30 years, it did not supply water in the Botany area and local residents depended on natural sources and tanks.<ref name=nswshr-1317-1904>Pollen, 1988, pp.35\u20136</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFollowing European colonisation the first substantial interventions in the area occurred in 1815 when the enterprising merchant Simeon Lord had a dam constructed to the west of the present Botany Road for the purpose of establishing the colony's first woollen mill. A second dam was constructed near the present Engine House ruins for a flour mill. This mill continued operating until about 1847 while the textile factory was closed by about 1856.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFrom 13 July 1855 the [[City of Sydney|City Council]] began resuming land around, and including, the Botany wetlands for the city's main water supply scheme \u2013 the first time land resumptions were made for this purpose. (The land was transferred to the Water Board in 1888.) Of this land about 75 acres of Lord's estate was resumed which included his house (demolished in the 1930s though the site of which is in the vicinity of the present heliport), the mill sites, various cottages and the earthworks associated with Lord's mill dams.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe initial water supply scheme of the mid-1850s, by the City Engineer W. B. Rider, was abandoned with the appointment of Edward Bell to the position. The surviving Engine House and chimney date from the implementation, in the late 1850s, of Bell's scheme while the stone retaining walls for the Engine Pond and outlet sluice probably date from the 1870s work on the Engine Pond augmentation. Between 1866 and the mid-1870s six dams were constructed, and reconstructed for various reasons, from the Mill Pond to Gardeners Road using piling of sheet timber facing filled with sand forming a core of a turfed bank. In 1859 a 30\" sand-cast iron main was completed between the Engine House and the Crown Street reservoir. The pipes were made in [[Scotland]] in 1856 and machined with such remarkably fine tolerance that, of the total length of 4 miles (6.4&nbsp;km), the outside diameter varied by only 6mm and allowed the pipes to be laid without jointing material. Part of this easement coincides with the present study area in the vicinity of the Engine House.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nDrawing on a 1982 thesis of Margaret Simpson, the Thorp et al. study indicates that about 80 trees \u2013 \"Norfolk Pines, Moreton Bay Figs, Weeping Figs, Sweet Scented Pines and Stone Pines\" \u2013 were planted along the access road from Botany and elsewhere on the site in 1869. Works for the augmentation of water storage at Botany continued throughout the 1870s including the addition of water stored in the Bunnerong Dam (1876\u20131877) by way of a pipe to the No 4 Pond. The then Bunnerong Road was moved and ran along the top of this dam wall.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nBy the early 1880s the [[Upper Nepean Scheme]] was well underway and in November 1886 the Nepean-supplied water effectively ended the general supply of Sydney's water from the Botany system. Even intermittent emergency use of the system ceased by 1893 so that the Engine House machinery was finally decommissioned with pumping equipment and boilers sold at auction in 1896. In 1894 various local industrial uses \u2013 such as wool scourers and tanners \u2013 were permitted to return to the wetland vicinity through leases until 1947.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nWhile these major improvement programs for Sydney's water supply were being put into place it also became clear \u2013 chiefly from an increasingly polluted harbour \u2013 that substantial works were needed to deal with the sewage of Sydney and its immediate suburbs. After the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage was formed in 1888 the basis of what is presently Sydney's largest sewerage system was commenced. As part of its responsibilities the new Board assumed control of various recent works of the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]], one of which was the first of the new sewer mains from the City to the Botany Sewage Farm established about 1886. Another main was added in 1898 which linked various western suburbs to the Sewage Farm. However, by the turn of the century the usefulness of the Farm was fast diminishing such that the southern and western sewerage systems were amalgamated and extended, from 1909, to a new ocean outfall at [[Malabar, New South Wales|Malabar]] while the much expanded Botany Sewage Farm was closed. This work \u2013 known as the Southern and Western Sewer Ocean Outfall System or, usually, SWSOOS No 1 \u2013 was completed in 1916 under the direction of Chief Engineer EM de Burgh.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFurther growth of Sydney's suburbs and resultant extensions to this sewerage network necessitated an augmentation of the system, by duplication known as SWSOOS No 2, during 1936 to 1941. Both mains were required to cross the [[Cooks River]] by inverted syphons. The current SWSOOS network represents Sydney's largest sewerage system and envelops mains that were constructed from the 1880s through the 1890s, 1900s, 1910s to 1940s. Other individually significant components of the SWSOOS network that occur in the vicinity of the present site include the twin major inverted syphons and syphonic overflows (now under [[Sydney Airport]]) and the 1896 sewer vent at West Botany Street, [[Arncliffe, New South Wales|Arncliffe]].<ref name=nswshr-1317-1905>ID No SW 31 \u2013 SHI 4571725</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nWithin the site the existing engine house chimney was retired for water supply use in 1888, left unused for 28 years then, after being shortened, re-used as a vent in 1916 as part of the work for the new SWSOOS. Various buildings, associated with the new sewerage system, were added to the west. During the 1940s the chimney was further truncated to its present height along with the diversion of the mouth of the Cooks River into Botany Bay and substantial filling of the Engine and Mill Ponds as part of a major expansion and upgrade of airport facilities. From the 1970s a greater appreciation of the special historical and environmental values of the place was apparent through the commissioning of a range of studies to record and assess its significance. However further incursions continued with the 1988 construction of [[Southern Cross Drive]] through the middle of the Engine Pond, reclamation by the DMR and more recent works associated with the pre-Olympics upgrade of the airport.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n===[[The Lakes Golf Club]] (1928)===\nIn 1928 construction of a clubhouse near Gardeners Road was commenced for the Lakes Golf Club with the course \u2013 to the west and north of the chain of ponds \u2013 opening in 1930.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAbout 1960 the Eastlakes Golf Club was established with an 18-hole course on the eastern and southern side of the ponds. The neighbouring course to the northeast, [[The Australian Golf Club]], was established in 1904 and in the same year it was host for the first Australian open golf title which was won by Michael Scott. Both the Lakes and Australian golf courses have been consistently ranked in the top five golf courses in New South Wales for many years.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe Lakes Golf Club practice precinct (east of the club house) was excavated on a number of occasions from 1928 to 1970. In the early 1970s the south-eastern area of this land was bulldozed and redeveloped as part of the overall golf course design as a direct result of the state government requiring some of the golf course land to construct Southern Cross Drive. This included extensive excavation of the area of the practice precinct of the golf course. In the mid-1970s some of the practice precinct area formed part of the tennis court construction which required bulldozing the area to prepare the ground for new tennis courts. This was conducted as part of construction of the golf course clubhouse<ref name=\"nswshr-1317-1908\">Kirkman, 2016, 4</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIn the early 2000s the practice precinct was renovated as part of a plan to improve course facilities for practice, and to have the course fit with the natural contours and appearance of the sandy dunes and lakes that dominate its site. This included extensive disturbance of the practice precinct area. In 2005 a new club house was built and this resulted in removal of the tennis courts. The practice precinct and some of the driving range tee was bulldozed to remove the tennis courts and then construct the practice chipping area.<ref name=nswshr-1317-1907>Kirkman, 2016, 4\u20135</ref><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nFrom 2007\u201309 the entire Lakes Golf Course underwent a comprehensive renovation which included extensive construction works to the south-western section of the practice precinct area. This involved use of a bulldozer and other construction equipment to construct the 10th tees and the area in front of them. This included the small ridge between the driving range tee and the front of the current 10th hole tees.<ref name=\"nswshr-1317-1908\"/><ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n== Description ==\nThis item consists of an extensive tract of open space/parkland, with 58 ha of wetlands, including Sydney Airport, The Australian Golf Course, Lakes Golf Course, Eastlakes Golf Course, Bonnie Doon Golf Course and Mutch Park. Other areas of wetlands in the vicinity are substantially smaller in extent \u2013 the Eve Street wetlands, Arncliffe (south of Kogarah Golf Club) and the chain of ponds in Sir Joseph Banks Park, Botany.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nImportant surviving elements of non-indigenous heritage include remnants of the water supply Engine House and [[chimney]] (late 1850s) (no longer owned by Sydney Water); spillway/weir, remnants of the Engine and Mill Ponds; the sequence of ponds between the Mill Pond and Gardeners Road; 1915 Sewer Pumphouse; twin sewer syphons and easements; partial evidence of old Cooks River edge (evident through comparing early and recent aerial photography; 1869 plantings of Norfolk Island Pines ([[Araucaria heterophylla]]), Moreton Bay Fig Trees ([[Ficus macrophylla]]) and Port Jackson Fig Trees ([[Ficus rubiginosa]]). Given the period, important government institutional use and the choice of tree species there is strong circumstantial evidence for the involvement of [[Charles Moore (botanist)|Charles Moore]] \u2013 Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens (1848\u20131896) in advising on these plantings. Canary Island Date Palms ([[Phoenix canariensis]]) also survive near the Engine Pond and may be remnants \u2013 or progeny \u2013 of 1910s plantings associated with the reuse of the site for the main southern sewer system. There is likewise strong circumstantial evidence for the involvement of [[Joseph Maiden|Joseph Henry Maiden]] \u2013 Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens (1896\u20131924) in recommending the choice of these plantings.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nA comparison of current aerial photographs and the Sydney Water Commission's 1869 topographic plan of the Lachlan Swamp from No 6 Dam to Botany Bay shows that there is a substantial degree of correlation between the layouts of many of the dams. Despite the bisection of the Engine Pond by Southern Cross Drive, it is still possible to appreciate the basic outline of the earlier pond. A similar observation holds for the former Bridge Pond as the present Mill Pond and the western half of the \"New Pond\" retain the earlier basic form. The embankment separating the Mill and New Ponds preserves part of the alignment of the old Sydney-Botany road (shown on the 1869 SWC plan) with its tollhouse site just south of the embankment. (Archaeological evidence of the former tollhouse may still exist.) The present Nos 1 and 2 Ponds closely reflect the earlier form of the 1869 No 1 Pond while most of the present Nos 3a, 3 and 4/5 Ponds almost exactly retain the earlier form of the 1869 Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5 Ponds respectively. The northern part of the old No 6 Pond has been filled. Generally, the present wetland layout retains a close indication of the original 1860s dam forms. Earlier pond formations existed some decades before, and were absorbed into, this system however surviving evidence is difficult to discern from both (non-intrusive) site inspections and an analysis of aerial photography. Archaeological investigations \u2013 if ever required \u2013 may reveal evidence of these early 19th century structures.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nA \"Plan of the Botany & Lachlan Watersheds\" signed by Francis Bell in June, 1875 shows that the Lachlan Water Supply (Centennial Park) links with the Botany Pond system as does the area of land containing the present Australian Golf Course.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nSeveral remnant areas of the famous and now rare Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub (still featuring the trademark Grass Trees ([[Xanthorrhoea resinosa]]) as well as various communities of reed and sedgeland species are represented within the open space boundaries. Other important indigenous vegetation vestiges include areas of Paperbark swamp featuring [[Melaleuca quinquenervia]], marshland and wet heath and large areas of the aquatic herb ''[[Ludwigia (plant)|Ludwigia]]''.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAs at 21 May 2004, major elements (the sequence of ponds) of Sydney's third main water supply system are substantially intact. Particular elements of the system \u2013 its architectural and planted elements \u2013 are only partially intact.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nAlthough the pre-European wetland ecosystem was modified during the 1860s and 1870s pond construction, there has been only limited major modification \u2013 mainly for the expansion of the airport and construction of new arterial roadways \u2013 since then. Major elements (the sequence of ponds) of Sydney's third main water supply system are substantially intact. Particular elements of the system \u2013 its architectural and planted elements \u2013 are only partially intact. Yet the little that remains of these are particularly poignant and serve as important local landmarks.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nBotany Water Reserve holds considerable value for Sydney and NSW because it contains the only remaining major components \u2013 substantial layout and other important physical evidence from the 1850s through to the 1870s \u2013 of the unique water supply system that supported the expansion of the Sydney metropolis for most of the latter half of the 19th century, representing Sydney's third main water supply system since colonisation; and on account of the surviving remnants of the early 19th century industries associated with the prominent emancipist merchant Simeon Lord. The site includes land which, in 1855, was the subject of the first resumptions for the purpose of a water supply system by a government in Australia. Part of the original 1850s sand-cast iron water supply pipe remains within the site representing a remnant of the State's oldest main.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThis extant remnant of the water supply system also has high collective value as important evidence likewise remains of the two principal Sydney water supply systems (The [[Tank Stream]] and [[Busby's Bore]]) that predated the Botany system along with those superseding it (The Upper Canal and regional dam systems).<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe open space areas encompassed by the item include two regionally rare and distinct remnant vegetation communities known as Sydney Freshwater Wetlands and [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]] Banksia Scrub that are both potentially of State significance and are the subject of separate listings as an Endangered Ecological Community under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The wetlands also have recognised regional ecological value as native animal habitat and movement corridors, and may include animal species of conservation significance.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe item is of regional environmental importance as a major recharge source for the Sydney basin aquifer.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIt likely holds special interest as a landmark cultural and recreational landscape for the regional community.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIt also has regional importance on account of the substantial infrastructure it contains of the 1910s Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer System<ref name=nswshr-1317-1909>SWSOOS No 1</ref>- since augmented during 1936\u20131941 by SWSOOS No 2 \u2013 representing one of the first major separate sewers in Sydney as well as incorporating new ventilation technologies. This infrastructure includes use of the former Engine House chimney as a sewer vent, the viaduct to carry the vent pipe, Sewage Pumping Station No 38 of 1916 near the Engine House ruins and part of the SWSOOS Nos 1 and 2 mains. The overall SWSOOS network remains Sydney's largest sewer system.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nBotany Water Reserves was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe item contains substantial remnants of structures and layout from Sydney's third main water supply system which supported the growth of Australia's largest city for most of the latter half of the 19th century. The 1850s water supply pipeline represents the oldest main in the State. The site contains important components of Sydney's main southern sewerage system from the 1910s and 1930s to 1940s supporting the expansion and consolidation of inner Sydney from the late 19th century to the present.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nIt also demonstrates the growth in demand for golf courses throughout the 20th century with the establishment of four separate courses including the Australian (est. 1904) and the Lakes Golf Course (est. 1928) \u2013 two of the State's oldest and most highly regarded.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nThe place also has strong and direct associations with prominent individuals \u2013 including Colonial entrepreneur Simeon Lord; the naval officer, surveyor and pastoralist Thomas Woore; City Engineers WB Rider, Edward Bell and Francis Bell; and Board engineers including EM de Burgh. Passing, though telling, early European references to the former landscape character of the area were made by many noted travellers including Captain James Cook in 1770 and Francois Peron in 1802.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAs surviving elements of Sydney's third main water supply system it is rare if not unique.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAs a modified/remnant wetland system it is representative of a once extensive vegetation community that included sites from Jewells Swamp, near [[Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)|Lake Macquarie]] to Coomaditchy Lagoon south of Sydney, yet as remnant sites within the [[Sydney Basin]] are now only of a small size and are threatened with extinction the wetlands should be considered rare. Similarly the areas of Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub are rare \u2013 of their total estimated area at the beginning of European colonisation less than 1% remains.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nSWSOOS is rare as the largest of Sydney's sewerage networks.<ref name=nswshr-1317/>\n\nAlthough the pre-European wetland ecosystem was modified during the 1860s and 1870s pond construction, there has been only limited major modification \u2013 mainly for the expansion of the airport and construction of new arterial roadways \u2013 since then. Major elements (the sequence of ponds) of Sydney's third main water supply system are substantially intact.

The engines were mid-mounted in the chassis, and the cylinders were horizontal.  Drive was to the rear wheels via a 4-speed gearbox and chain. The gearbox is in 2 parts, linked by a connecting rod, the left one containing 2nd and 4th gear, and the right 1st, 3rd and reverse.\n\nThe 2-cylinder engine is rated at 9 HP, and is just over 2.5 liters in size. A [[total-loss oiling system]] is used on the car, lubricating 6 main oil-ways. James & Browne also launched a 4-cylinder version (16 HP), of a similar design to the horizontal 2-cylinder engine.\n\nIn 1906 a vertical-engined car was introduced known as the Vertex and available as either a 20&nbsp;hp four or 30/40&nbsp;hp six-cylinder.\n\n== Surviving cars ==\nOnly two of their cars are known to have survived, one built in 1902 and the other in 1904. T.B. Browne, one of the company's founders, remained interested in the condition of the two surviving cars throughout his life and still regularly met with the owners until the early 1960s.\n\n===1902 model===\nThe car was built in 1902 and transported by train from the James and Browne works in [[Hammersmith, London]] to Albrighton Station, [[Shropshire]]. The first owner was Mr. Norman McLean of The Blue House, [[Tong, Shropshire]]. Mr. McLean had the car painted in the colours of his stables which were yellow with black lining. The car was then moved to [[Tong Castle]], the home of his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Hartley. The Hartley family had leased [[Tong Castle]] from Lord Bradford since 1855. Miss Hartley\u2019s brother was [[John Hartley (tennis)]], the winner of the Wimbledon Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship in 1879 and 1880.\n\nMr. McLean decided that some alterations to the car were required and instructed Mr. Ernest Roy Spencer to carry out the work. The Spencers were blacksmiths and ran their business at 15 Broadway, [[Shifnal]],<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Watts |editor-first=Sylvia |title=Shifnal, A Pictorial History |year=1989 |publisher= |isbn=0-85033-686-4}}</ref> around three miles from [[Tong Castle]]. \n\nIn 1910 Mr. McLean decided to sell the car to Ernest Spencer for a nominal sum of \u00a320, and the car was then moved to 15 Broadway, [[Shifnal]]. Ernest Spencer decided that Mr. McLean\u2019s colour scheme was too conspicuous for general use and drinking trips, so decided to paint the car battleship grey with black piping. Mr. Spencer intended to convert the car to a pick-up truck for his business and fitted it with magneto ignition and a windscreen. However, with the outbreak of [[World War 1]] in Summer 1914, the car was mothballed and stored in a shed at the back of the premises and stayed there until 1929. \n\nIn 1929 it was decided to enter the car in the Old Crock's Run to Brighton. The less permanent alterations to the car were removed and it was returned to as near original condition as possible. The car took part in the Brighton run on Sunday 20th October (entry number 25) and departed from the Mall at around 9am. The car had a good run but lost time when the battery terminals shook loose, and was the fifth car to arrive in Brighton.\n\nIn December 1929, ownership of the car passed to Mr. Herbert Ford who purchased the car from the Spencers for the sum of \u00a335. Mr. Ford was a local man and shrewd businessman, and had owned nearby [[Lilleshall Hall]] since 1927. In 1930, Mr. Ford opened some pleasure gardens for the public at [[Lilleshall Hall]], and these included an amusement park, narrow gauge railway and children's playgrounds. The car was used as an attraction in the amusement park. Mr. Ford and his friend, Mr. T.R. Price, entered the car in the 1933 Brighton Run on Sunday 12th November 1933. The car (entry number 21) completed the run successfully with an average speed of 19.61 mph. \n\nIn October 1934 the car was purchased by John Garland, Dick and Edward Riddle, three students at the City and Guilds College, part of [[Imperial College London]]. The car has been an active part of college life from 1934 to the present day. The car is still maintained by students and driven in many events including the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]].\n\n===1904 model===\nThe first owner of the 1904 car was The Reverend Dr. John Darlington, the vicar of St Mark's Church, [[Kennington]] in London, who also owned a house in [[Curry Rivel]], near [[Taunton]] in Somerset. The Reverend had originally owned a Peugeot which had badly let him down in 1905, and as a friend of his had a reliable two-cylinder James & Browne car he visited the Showroom in Oxford Street and asked to buy a car \"like the one my friend owns\".  Browne remembered this visit as he had to advise Darlington that the Company had ceased making two-cylinder models in 1904, but he could offer Darlington a new four-cylinder 1905 model. Darlington was adamant that he wanted a two-cylinder car, so it was arranged that an unused two-cylinder engine, gearbox and transmission from the workshop be fitted into a compatible spare chassis, but with a later model body designed for the four-cylinder car.\n\nErnest Proctor, who was employed at the Westcroft Works, was given the job of assembling this hybrid car, which comprised a very early two-cylinder engine - number 30 - of 1901 or 1902 vintage, a 1904 chassis - number 126, and a body destined for four-cylinder car number 156.\n\nTechnical data:\n:Engine: No.30. Twin-cylinder horizontal, each cylinder 4\" dia. x 6\" stroke. Inlet valves suction operated: exhaust valves mechanically operated. Water-cooled, with no pump or cooling fan.\n:Ignition: 6 volt battery producing ignition via 2 trembler coils (originally also fitted with magneto with switching between trembler and magneto as required). Conventional spark plugs.\n:Lubrication: Drip feed from reservoir on dashboard via sight glasses to 6 oiling points on main bearings and pistons.\n:Gearboxes: Two boxes - one for 1st. 3rd. and reverse, the other for 2nd. and 4th. with a sliding shaft between the two. Lubrication by splash feed in each box.\n:Transmission: Main drive from engine to gear boxes via heavy steel spur gear into a mating 'Buffoline' rawhide gear attached to the flywheel on the crank shaft.\n:Final Drive: By two chains via a differential.\n:Brakes: Foot brake operates on transmission. Hand brake is a conventional drum brake on the rear wheels only.\n:Wheels/tires: Originally wooden wheels with solid tires, but these were changed in the early years to Sankey type metal wheels and fitted with balloon tires.\n:Lighting: Side and rear lamps - oil (paraffin). Headlamps acetylene - gas produced from carbide/water accumulator.\n\nThe car was first registered Y184 and was delivered to Darlington at Kennington Vicarage on 10 March 1906. It was used in London until it was driven to Curry Rivel on 23 April 1906 by Henry Lucas, a James & Browne salesman, who remained with the owner for some time after delivery, to teach him how to drive and maintain the vehicle.\n\nThe car was driven by Darlington, accompanied by his eldest son John, in 1913/1914, on a 2,000 mile tour of Europe. At the outbreak of World War 1, the car was taken back to Kennington where it remained until about 1925, when John Darlington Jr. \"got it going again\", and drove it back to Curry Rivel. By this time Dr. Darlington had purchased an Armstrong, so the James & Browne was stored in a barn. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhen the James & Browne Company ceased trading, Henry Lucas (the salesman and chauffeur) with his colleague and friend Ernest Proctor were both made redundant. Lucas, with a partner John Drake, started a motor business in Egham, Surrey called the Egham Motor Company, and in 1914 asked Proctor to join them as Works Manager.\n\nWhile on holiday in Somerset in 1938, Lucas called at the house in Curry Rivel to see what had happened to the Darlington family; Dr. Darlington was still there and so was the James & Browne car..... in the barn. Dr. Darlington gave the car to Lucas who brought it back to Egham where he and Proctor restored it. It was then kept in the showroom of The Egham Motor Company for many years.\n\nHowever, when applying to register the car after its restoration, it was discovered that Dr. Darlington had transferred the original registration number, Y184, to his Armstrong, which was (and we believe, still is) on the road! \nSomerset County Council allocated the nearest unused number to the James & Browne ...Y182 - hence the temporary 2 was fixed over the 4 on the original number plates.\n\nAfter World War II the car was officially dated by the [[Veteran Car Club of Great Britain|Veteran Car Club]] as a 1904 model, and Lucas and Proctor entered it in the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run|London to Brighton Run]] in November 1948 - the first London to Brighton run for the car. Henry Lucas was driving and Ernest Proctor was passenger.\n\nProctor's eldest son, Sidney, joined his father and Henry on many of the early runs, until Ernest died in 1958.\nBy 1963, Lucas had become too infirm to continue to look after the car and, as he had no children, he sold the car to Sidney Proctor. On Sidney\u2019s death the car passed to his son. The car was in the Proctor family until it was auctioned in November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonhams: 1904 James & Browne 9hp Twin Cylinder Rear Entrance Tonneau 126|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/15346/lot/305/}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Stand 81, [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders|SMM&T]] 5th International Motor Exhibition February 1906==\n[[File:James & Browne car advertisement circa late 1906.png|thumb]]\nJames & Browne's display from the official catalogue:<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112039171&view=1up&seq=9 The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders]</ref>\n:16-HP 4-cylinder ''J & B'' chassis: 4 speeds, 1 reverse, fitted with patent motor starter.

Says the legal document (attached), the withdrawal was done without any kind of pressure in witness of the lawyers of both the parties- the defendant as well as the complainant. \u00a0On this day, it has been officially\u00a0 announced that there are no pending claims thereof. \u00a0\n\nC R Patil joined the Surat police in 1975 as a police constable.  Mr. Patil joined the BJP in 1990. In four short years, with his diligent work he became the Surat District President. But political motives couldn't leave him out of the mean olives of defaming him. In 2002, the Crime Branch arrested Mr. Patil as the chief defaulter in the Diamond Jubilee Cooperative Bank scam. He had taken a loan of more than Rs 540&nbsp;million from the cooperative bank and did not repay the amount causing the bank to be suspended from the clearing house in 2002. He had to remain in jail for 15 months until he secured bail from the Gujarat High Court on the condition that he would repay the dues. Another concern arose wherein he took 48 acres of land at Sachin to construct 65,000 flats for textile labourers. He made a down payment of Rs 60&nbsp;million for possession of the GIDC land on lease for 90 years and got delayed to pay the rest. After the re-arrested, Mr. Patil moved the Supreme Court and reimbursed the loan money with interest: Rs 880&nbsp;million towards the cooperative bank loan of Rs. 460&nbsp;million and the rest for the GIDC land lease cost. The MP has paid back not only the loans but with more than the interest and had offered to even help further. C R Patil was soon made chairman of the state-owned Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd. Mr. Patil has one of the longest affidavits submitted to the Election Commission of India. Conclusively, out of 103 cases 96 has been clearly resolved till 2015. (As per the authorised letter attached)\n\nFurther, now with the announcement at the National Lok Adaalat, there are no pending allegations henceforth due to withdrawal of the complaints.

Out of these, 96 claims have now been disposed out. The attested copy of the claims has been attached herewith that may kindly be taken on your official records and you are requested to kindly update the same on your website with necessary corrections.\n\nThanking You\n\nC.R. Paatil\n\nCopy to:\n\n(1) The Commissioner, State Elections, Gujarat State\n\nSardar Patel Bhavan, Sector no. 10, Block no. 9, 6th floor, Gandhinagar\n\n(2) The Collector, Navsari\n\nJilla Sevasadan, Kaliavadi, Navsari\n]]\nAt the National Lok Adaalat held on 9 March 2019, the complainant and their learned lawyer on behalf of their complainant client withdrew all their unproven allegations made against CR Patil. Says the legal document (attached), the withdrawal was done without any kind of pressure in witness of the lawyers of both the parties- the defendant as well as the complainant. \u00a0On this day, it has been officially\u00a0 announced that there are no pending claims thereof. \u00a0\n\nC R Patil joined the Surat police in 1975 as a police constable.  Mr. Patil joined the BJP in 1990. In four short years, with his diligent work he became the Surat District President. But political motives couldn't leave him out of the mean olives of defaming him. In 2002, the Crime Branch arrested Mr. Patil as the chief defaulter in the Diamond Jubilee Cooperative Bank scam. He had taken a loan of more than Rs 540&nbsp;million from the cooperative bank and did not repay the amount causing the bank to be suspended from the clearing house in 2002. He had to remain in jail for 15 months until he secured bail from the Gujarat High Court on the condition that he would repay the dues. Another concern arose wherein he took 48 acres of land at Sachin to construct 65,000 flats for textile labourers. He made a down payment of Rs 60&nbsp;million for possession of the GIDC land on lease for 90 years and got delayed to pay the rest. After the re-arrested, Mr. Patil moved the Supreme Court and reimbursed the loan money with interest: Rs 880&nbsp;million towards the cooperative bank loan of Rs. 460&nbsp;million and the rest for the GIDC land lease cost. The MP has paid back not only the loans but with more than the interest and had offered to even help further. C R Patil was soon made chairman of the state-owned Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd. Mr. Patil has one of the longest affidavits submitted to the Election Commission of India. Conclusively, out of 103 cases 96 has been clearly resolved till 2015. (As per the authorised letter attached)\n\nFurther, now with the announcement at the National Lok Adaalat, there are no pending allegations henceforth due to withdrawal of the complaints.

Global Footprint Network estimates that in less than eight months, we demand more [[renewable resource]]s and [[Carbon sequestration|CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration]] than what the planet can provide for an entire year.<ref name=EOD />\n\nThroughout most of history, humanity has used nature's resources to build cities and roads, to provide food and create products, and to [[CO2 emissions|release carbon dioxide]] at a rate that was well within Earth's budget.

According to [[Global Footprint Network]]\u2019s calculations, our demand for renewable ecological resources and the services they provide is now equivalent to that of more than 1.5 Earths.

Essentially, the sum of all demands competing for the planet's regeneration are now exceeding what the planet renews. While the accounting can be improved, and more details added, in its current applications to countries, the accounts typically underestimate human demand as not all aspects are measured (there are gaps in UN data). They also overestimate biocapacity because it is ambiguous to determine how much of current yields are enabled by reduced future yield (for instance as in the case of overuse of groundwater, or erosion). Therefore, current accounts underplay the overall ecological deficit or overshoot at the global level. This is discussed in more detail in two chapters of the Routledge Handbook of Sustainability Indicators (Wackernagel et al. 2018 a and b).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wackernagel|display-authors=etal|first1=Mathis| title=Handbook of Sustainability Indicators \u2013 Chapter 16 \u2013 Ecological Footprint: Principles & Chapter 33 \u2013 Ecological Footprint: Criticisms and applications |url=https://www.routledgehandbooks.com|website=Routledge 2018|accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, ecological footprint accounts are metrics that merely define minimal conditions for sustainability. They do not cover all material aspects of sustainability, just a basic, minimal condition for living within the regenerative capacity of the planet's ecosystems.\n\nIn response to the Breakthrough Institute Report, Mathis Wackernagel, founder and president of the Global Footprint Network, also points out that depletion of crop land, for instance, could be included in the Ecological Footprint accounts informing Earth Overshoot Day. But such improvements would \"require data sets that do not exist within the UN data set\". And such improvements would show an even larger global overshoot.

They do not cover all material aspects of sustainability, just a basic, minimal condition for living within the regenerative capacity of the planet's ecosystems.\n\nIn response to the Breakthrough Institute Report, Mathis Wackernagel, founder and president of the Global Footprint Network, also points out that depletion of crop land, for instance, could be included in the Ecological Footprint accounts informing Earth Overshoot Day. But such improvements would \"require data sets that do not exist within the UN data set\". And such improvements would show an even larger global overshoot. Similarly, the apparent fishery surplus \"might be more a reflection of poor UN fisheries data than healthy fisheries\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Overshoot (population)]]\n*[[Tax Freedom Day]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* Catton, William R.

They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few [[islands]] to more than a dozen. They are subject to change during storms and other action, but absorb energy and protect the coastlines and create areas of protected waters where [[wetland]]s may flourish. A barrier chain may extend uninterrupted for over a hundred kilometers, excepting the tidal [[inlets]] that separate the islands, the longest and widest being [[Padre Island]] of Texas.<ref>Garrison, J.R., Jr., Williams, J., Potter Miller, S., Weber, E.T., II, McMechan, G., and Zeng, X., 2010, \"Ground-penetrating radar study of North Padre Island; Implications for barrier island interval architecture, model for growth of progradational microtidal barrier islands, and Gulf of Mexico sea-level cyclicity:\" ''Journal of Sedimentary Research,' v. 80, p. 303\u2013319.</ref> The length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including [[tidal range]], [[wave energy]], [[Sediment transport|sediment supply]], [[Sea level|sea-level trends]], and [[Seabed|basement controls]].<ref name = \"Davis 144\">Davis Jr., p. 144.</ref> The amount of vegetation on the barrier has a large impact on the height and evolution of the island.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dur\u00e1n Vinent|first=Orencio|last2=Moore|first2=Laura J.|title=Barrier island bistability induced by biophysical interactions|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=2|pages=158\u2013162|doi=10.1038/nclimate2474|year=2015}}</ref>\n\nChains of barrier islands can be found along approximately 13-15% of the world's coastlines.<ref name=\"Smith, Q.H.T. 2010, p. 292\">Smith, Q.H.T., Heap, A.D., and Nichol, S.L., 2010, \"Origin and formation of an estuarine barrier island, Tapora Island, New Zealand:\" ''Journal of Coastal Research,'' v. 26, p. 292\u2013300.</ref> They display different settings, suggesting that they can form and be maintained in a variety of environmental settings. Numerous theories have been given to explain their formation.\n\n==Constituent parts==\n;Lower shoreface\nThe [[shoreface]] is the part of the barrier where the ocean meets the shore of the island.  The barrier island body itself separates the shoreface from the backshore and [[lagoon]]/[[tidal flat]] area.  Characteristics common to the lower shoreface are fine sands with mud and possibly silt.  Further out into the ocean the sediment becomes finer.  The effect from the waves at this point is weak because of the depth.  [[Bioturbation]] is common and many [[fossil]]s can be found here. Barrier islands can be found mainly in China\n\n;Middle shoreface\nThe middle shore face is located in  the upper shoreface.  The middle shoreface is strongly influenced by wave action because of its depth.  Closer to shore the grain size will be medium size sands with shell pieces common.  Since wave action is heavier, bioturbation is not likely.\n\n;Upper shoreface\nThe [[upper shore face]] is constantly affected by wave action.  This results in development of herringbone [[sedimentary structure]]s because of the constant differing flow of waves.  Grain size is larger sands.\n\n;Foreshore\nThe [[foreshore]] is the area on land between high and low tide.  Like the upper shoreface, it is constantly affected by wave action.  [[Cross bedding]] and lamination are present and coarser sands are present because of the high energy present by the crashing of the waves.  The sand is also very well sorted.\n\n;Backshore\nThe [[backshore]] is always above the highest water level point.  The [[berm]] is also found here which marks the boundary between the foreshore and backshore.  Wind is the important factor here, not water.  During strong storms high waves and wind can deliver and erode sediment from the backshore.\n\n;Dunes\nThe dunes are typical of a barrier island, located at the top of the backshore. Dunes are made by the wind. See [[Dune#Coastal dunes|Coastal Dunes]] for more information. The dunes will display characteristics of typical [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] wind blown dunes.  The difference here is that dunes on a barrier island typically contain coastal vegetation roots and marine bioturbation.\n\n;Lagoon and tidal flats\nThe [[lagoon]] and [[tidal flat]] area is located behind the dune and backshore area.  Here the water is still and this allows for fine silts, sands, and mud to settle out.  Lagoons can become host to an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment.  This will allow high amounts of organic rich mud to form.  Vegetation is also common.\n\n== Location ==\n\n=== Australia ===\n\n[[Moreton Bay]], on the east coast of Australia and directly east of [[Brisbane]], is sheltered from the Pacific Ocean by a chain of very large barrier islands. Running north to south they are [[Bribie Island]], [[Moreton Island]], [[North Stradbroke Island]] and [[South Stradbroke Island]] (the last two used to be a single island until a storm created a channel between them in 1896). North Stradbroke Island is the second largest sand island in the world and Moreton Island is the third largest.\n\n[[Fraser Island]], another barrier island lying 200&nbsp;km north of Moreton Bay on the same coastline, is the largest sand island in the world.\n\n=== United States ===\n\nThey are seen most prominently on the United States' East Coast and Gulf Coast, where every state, stretching from Maine to Florida and Florida to Texas on each coast has at least part of a barrier island, stretching to more than twenty-five for Florida. However, this chain is international. It starts in Quebec's [[Magdalen Islands]] and ends in Mexico. No barrier islands are found on the Pacific coast of the United States due to the rocky shore and short continental shelf, but barrier peninsulas can be found. Barrier islands can also be seen on Alaska's Arctic coast.\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nBarrier Islands can also be found in Maritime Canada, and other places along the coast. A good example is found at [[Miramichi Bay]], [[New Brunswick]], where Portage Island as well as [[Fox Island, New Brunswick|Fox Island]] and Hay Island protect the inner bay from storms in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].\n\n=== Mexico ===\n\nMexico's Gulf Coast has numerous barrier islands and barrier Peninsulas.\n\n===New Zealand===\nBarrier islands are more prevalent in the north of both of New Zealand's main islands. Notable barrier islands in New Zealand include [[Matakana Island]], which guards the entrance to [[Tauranga Harbour]], and [[Rabbit Island, New Zealand|Rabbit Island]], at the southern end of [[Tasman Bay]]. See also Nelson Harbour's [[Boulder Bank]], below.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nBarrier islands can be observed in the Baltic Sea and are a distinct feature of the [[Wadden Islands]], which stretch from the Netherlands to Denmark. [[Lido di Venezia]] and [[Pellestrina]] are notable barrier islands of the [[Lagoon of Venice]] which have for centuries protected the city of [[Venice]] in Italy.\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n\nBarrier Islands can be observed on every continent on Earth, except Antarctica.\n\n==Processes==\n\n;Migration and overwash\nWater levels may be higher than the island during storm events. This situation can lead to [[overwash]], which brings sand from the front of the island to the top and/or landward side of the island. This process leads to the evolution and migration of the barrier island.<ref name=\"Lorenzo-TruebaAshton2014\">{{Cite journal| last = Lorenzo-Trueba | first = J.| author2= Ashton, A. | year = 2014| title = Rollover, drowning, and discontinuous retreat: Distinct modes of barrier response to sea-level rise arising from a simple morphodynamic model| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface| volume = 119 | issue= 4 | pages = 779\u2013801| doi =  10.1002/2013JF002941 | url = https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/6714/1/jgrf20235.pdf| hdl = 1912/6714}}</ref>\n;Critical width concept \nBarrier islands are often formed to have a certain width. The term \u201ccritical width concept\u201d has been discussed with reference to barrier islands, overwash, and washover deposits since the 1970s.  The concept basically states that overwash processes were effective in migration of the barrier only where the barrier width is less than a critical value. The island did not narrow below these values because overwash was effective at transporting sediment over the barrier island, thereby keeping pace with the rate of ocean shoreline recession. Sections of the island with greater widths experienced washover deposits that did not reach the bayshore, and the island narrowed by ocean shoreline recession until it reached the critical width. The only process that widened the barrier beyond the critical width was breaching, formation of a partially subaerial flood shoal, and subsequent inlet closure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leatherman |first1=S.P |title=Barrier island migration: an assessment of the overwash process |journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |volume=8 |date=1976 |page=215}}</ref>\nFor the present discussion, critical barrier width is defined as the smallest cross-shore dimension that minimizes net loss of sediment from the barrier island over the defined project lifetime. The magnitude of critical width is related to sources and sinks of sand in the system, such as the volume stored in the dunes and the net long-shore and cross-shore sand transport, as well as the island elevation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosati |first1=J.D |title=Concepts for Functional Restoration of Barrier Islands |date=2009 |issue=Engineer research and development center vicksburg ms environmental lab}}</ref> The concept of critical width is important for large-scale barrier island restoration, in which islands are reconstructed to optimum height, width, and length for providing protection for estuaries, bays, marshes and mainland beaches.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosati |first1=J.D |last2=Dean |first2=R.G |last3=Stone |first3=G.W |title=Morphologic evolution of subsiding barrier island systems |journal=Proceedings 30th International Coastal Engineering Conference, World Scientific Press, in Press. |date=2007}}</ref>\n\n==Formation theories==\n[[File:Long Island Landsat Mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Outer barrier]] in Long Island.]]\n[[File:Baie de Mobile.jpg|thumb|The Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands guarding [[Mobile Bay]] and [[Mississippi Sound]].]]\n\nScientists have proposed numerous explanations for the formation of barrier islands for more than 150 years. There are three major theories: offshore bar, spit accretion, and submergence.<ref name = \"Davis 144\"/> No single theory can explain the development of all barriers, which are distributed extensively along the world's coastlines. Scientists accept the idea that barrier islands, including other barrier types, can form by a number of different mechanisms.<ref name = \"Davis 147\">Davis Jr., p. 147</ref>\n\nThere appears to be some general requirements for formation. Barrier island systems develop most easily on wave-dominated coasts with a small to moderate tidal range. Coasts are classified into three groups based on [[tidal range]]: microtidal, 0\u20132 meter tidal range; mesotidal, 2\u20134 meter tidal range; and macrotidal, >4 meter tidal range. Barrier islands tend to form primarily along microtidal coasts, where they tend to be well developed and nearly continuous. They are less frequently formed in mesotidal coasts, where they are typically short with tidal inlets common. Barrier islands are very rare along macrotidal coasts.<ref>Boggs, S., Jr., 2012, ''Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy:'' New Jersey, Pearson Education, Inc., 585 p.</ref> Along with a small tidal range and a wave-dominated coast, there must be a relatively low gradient shelf. Otherwise, sand accumulation into a sandbar would not occur and instead would be dispersed throughout the shore. An ample sediment supply is also a requirement for barrier island formation.<ref name=\"Smith, Q.H.T. 2010, p. 292\"/> The last major requirement for barrier island formation is a stable sea level. It is especially important for sea level to remain relatively unchanged during barrier island formation and growth. If sea level changes are too drastic, time will be insufficient for wave action to accumulate sand into a dune, which will eventually become a barrier island through [[aggradation]]. The formation of barrier islands requires a constant sea level so that waves can concentrate the sand into one location.<ref>Coastal Services Center, [http://www.csc.noaa.gov/beachnourishment/html/geo/barrier.htm NOAA\u2019s Coastal Services Center Barrier Islands: Formation and Evolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808000000/http://www.csc.noaa.gov/beachnourishment/html/geo/barrier.htm |date=August 8, 2010 }}. Accessed April 10, 2011.</ref>\n\n===Offshore bar theory===\nIn 1845 the Frenchman [[Elie de Beaumont]] published an account of barrier formation. He believed that waves moving into shallow water churned up sand, which was deposited in the form of a submarine [[Bar (landform)|bar]] when the waves broke and lost much of their energy. As the bars developed vertically, they gradually rose above sea level, forming barrier islands.\n\n===Spit accretion theory===\nAmerican geologist [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] first argued in 1885 that the barrier sediments came from longshore sources. He proposed that sediment moving in the breaker zone through agitation by waves in [[longshore drift]] would construct [[Spit (landform)|spits]] extending from [[headlands]] parallel to the coast. The subsequent breaching of spits by storm waves would form barrier islands.<ref>Davis Jr., pp. 144\u2013145</ref>\n\n===Submergence theory===\n[[File:Isles Dernieres.gif|thumb|[[Last Island, Louisiana|Isles Dernieres]] in 1853 and 1978. Wave action detaches Isles Dernieres from the mainland.]]\n\n[[William John McGee]] reasoned in 1890 that the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf coasts]] of the [[United States]] were undergoing submergence, as evidenced by the many drowned river valleys that occur along these coasts, including [[Raritan Bay|Raritan]], [[Delaware Bay|Delaware]] and [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] bays. He believed that during submergence, coastal ridges were separated from the mainland, and lagoons formed behind the ridges.<ref>Davis Jr., p. 145</ref> He used the Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands (consists of [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|Ship]], [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn]], [[Petit Bois Island (Mississippi)|Petit Bois]] and [[Dauphin Island|Dauphin]] Islands) as an example where coastal submergence formed barrier islands. His interpretation was later shown to be incorrect when the ages of the coastal stratigraphy and sediment were more accurately determined.<ref>Morton, p. 2</ref>\n\nAlong the coast of [[Louisiana]], former lobes of the [[Mississippi River]] delta have been reworked by wave action, forming beach ridge complexes. Prolonged sinking of the marshes behind the barriers has converted these former vegetated wetlands to open-water areas. In a period of 125 years, from 1853 to 1978, two small semi-protected bays behind the barrier developed as the large water body of [[Lake Pelto]], leading to [[Isles Dernieres]]'s detachment from the mainland.<ref name = \"Davis 147\"/>\n\n===Boulder Bank===\nAn unusual natural structure in [[New Zealand]] may give clues to the formation processes of barrier islands. The [[Boulder Bank]], at the entrance to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson Haven]] at the northern end of the [[South Island]], is a unique 13&nbsp;km-long stretch of rocky substrate a few metres in width. It is not strictly a barrier island, as it is linked to the mainland at one end. The Boulder Bank is composed of [[granodiorite]] from Mackay Bluff, which lies close to the point where the bank joins the mainland. It is still debated what process or processes have resulted in this odd structure, though longshore drift is the most accepted hypothesis. Studies have been conducted since 1892 to determine the speed of boulder movement. Rates of the top-course gravel movement have been estimated at 7.5 metres a year.<ref name=\"Nelson Boulder Bank\">{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/00288306.2001.9514924 | author=M. R. Johnson| title=Nelson Boulder Bank| journal=New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics| year=2001| volume=44| pages=79\u201388}}</ref>\n\n== Ecological importance ==\nBarrier islands are critically important in mitigating ocean swells and other storm events for the water systems on the mainland side of the barrier island, as well as protecting the coastline. This effectively creates a unique environment of relatively low energy, [[brackish water]]. Multiple wetland systems such as lagoons, estuaries, and/or marshes can result from such conditions depending on the surroundings. They are typically rich habitats for a variety of flora and fauna. Without barrier islands, these wetlands could not exist; they would be destroyed by daily ocean waves and tides as well as ocean storm events. One of the most prominent examples is the [[Louisiana]] barrier islands.<ref>Stone, G.W., and McBride, R.A., 1998, \"Louisiana barrier islands and their importance in wetland protection: forecasting shoreline change and subsequent response of wave climate:\" ''Journal of Coastal Research,'' v. 14, p. 900\u2013915.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[North Frisian Barrier Island]](s)\n*[[Outer Banks]]\n*[[Virginia Barrier Islands]]\n*[[New York Barrier Islands]]\n*[[Texas barrier islands]]\n*[[Sea Islands]]\n*[[Long Beach Island]]\n*[[Bald Head Island, North Carolina|Bald Head Island]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last = Davis Jr. | first = Richard A. | last2 = FitzGerald | first2 = Duncan M. | title = Beaches and Coasts | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Blackwell Publishing]] | isbn = 978-0-632-04308-8 | location = United Kingdom}}\n* {{Citation | last = Morton | first = Robert A. | title = Historical Changes in the Mississippi-Alabama Barrier Islands and the Roles of Extreme Storms, Sea level, and human activities | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1161/OFR-2007-1161-screen.pdf | year = 2007 | publisher = U.

North Stradbroke Island is the second largest sand island in the world and Moreton Island is the third largest.\n\n[[Fraser Island]], another barrier island lying 200&nbsp;km north of Moreton Bay on the same coastline, is the largest sand island in the world.\n\n=== United States ===\n\nThey are seen most prominently on the United States' East Coast and Gulf Coast, where every state, stretching from Maine to Florida and Florida to Texas on each coast has at least part of a barrier island, stretching to more than twenty-five for Florida. However, this chain is international. It starts in Quebec's [[Magdalen Islands]] and ends in Mexico. No barrier islands are found on the Pacific coast of the United States due to the rocky shore and short continental shelf, but barrier peninsulas can be found. Barrier islands can also be seen on Alaska's Arctic coast.\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nBarrier Islands can also be found in Maritime Canada, and other places along the coast. A good example is found at [[Miramichi Bay]], [[New Brunswick]], where Portage Island as well as [[Fox Island, New Brunswick|Fox Island]] and Hay Island protect the inner bay from storms in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].\n\n=== Mexico ===\n\nMexico's Gulf Coast has numerous barrier islands and barrier Peninsulas.\n\n===New Zealand===\nBarrier islands are more prevalent in the north of both of New Zealand's main islands. Notable barrier islands in New Zealand include [[Matakana Island]], which guards the entrance to [[Tauranga Harbour]], and [[Rabbit Island, New Zealand|Rabbit Island]], at the southern end of [[Tasman Bay]]. See also Nelson Harbour's [[Boulder Bank]], below.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\nBarrier islands can be observed in the Baltic Sea and are a distinct feature of the [[Wadden Islands]], which stretch from the Netherlands to Denmark. [[Lido di Venezia]] and [[Pellestrina]] are notable barrier islands of the [[Lagoon of Venice]] which have for centuries protected the city of [[Venice]] in Italy.\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n\nBarrier Islands can be observed on every continent on Earth, except Antarctica.\n\n==Processes==\n\n;Migration and overwash\nWater levels may be higher than the island during storm events. This situation can lead to [[overwash]], which brings sand from the front of the island to the top and/or landward side of the island. This process leads to the evolution and migration of the barrier island.<ref name=\"Lorenzo-TruebaAshton2014\">{{Cite journal| last = Lorenzo-Trueba | first = J.| author2= Ashton, A. | year = 2014| title = Rollover, drowning, and discontinuous retreat: Distinct modes of barrier response to sea-level rise arising from a simple morphodynamic model| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface| volume = 119 | issue= 4 | pages = 779\u2013801| doi =  10.1002/2013JF002941 | url = https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/6714/1/jgrf20235.pdf| hdl = 1912/6714}}</ref>\n;Critical width concept \nBarrier islands are often formed to have a certain width. The term \u201ccritical width concept\u201d has been discussed with reference to barrier islands, overwash, and washover deposits since the 1970s.  The concept basically states that overwash processes were effective in migration of the barrier only where the barrier width is less than a critical value. The island did not narrow below these values because overwash was effective at transporting sediment over the barrier island, thereby keeping pace with the rate of ocean shoreline recession. Sections of the island with greater widths experienced washover deposits that did not reach the bayshore, and the island narrowed by ocean shoreline recession until it reached the critical width. The only process that widened the barrier beyond the critical width was breaching, formation of a partially subaerial flood shoal, and subsequent inlet closure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leatherman |first1=S.P |title=Barrier island migration: an assessment of the overwash process |journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |volume=8 |date=1976 |page=215}}</ref>\nFor the present discussion, critical barrier width is defined as the smallest cross-shore dimension that minimizes net loss of sediment from the barrier island over the defined project lifetime. The magnitude of critical width is related to sources and sinks of sand in the system, such as the volume stored in the dunes and the net long-shore and cross-shore sand transport, as well as the island elevation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosati |first1=J.D |title=Concepts for Functional Restoration of Barrier Islands |date=2009 |issue=Engineer research and development center vicksburg ms environmental lab}}</ref> The concept of critical width is important for large-scale barrier island restoration, in which islands are reconstructed to optimum height, width, and length for providing protection for estuaries, bays, marshes and mainland beaches.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosati |first1=J.D |last2=Dean |first2=R.G |last3=Stone |first3=G.W |title=Morphologic evolution of subsiding barrier island systems |journal=Proceedings 30th International Coastal Engineering Conference, World Scientific Press, in Press. |date=2007}}</ref>\n\n==Formation theories==\n[[File:Long Island Landsat Mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Outer barrier]] in Long Island.]]\n[[File:Baie de Mobile.jpg|thumb|The Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands guarding [[Mobile Bay]] and [[Mississippi Sound]].]]\n\nScientists have proposed numerous explanations for the formation of barrier islands for more than 150 years. There are three major theories: offshore bar, spit accretion, and submergence.<ref name = \"Davis 144\"/> No single theory can explain the development of all barriers, which are distributed extensively along the world's coastlines. Scientists accept the idea that barrier islands, including other barrier types, can form by a number of different mechanisms.<ref name = \"Davis 147\">Davis Jr., p. 147</ref>\n\nThere appears to be some general requirements for formation. Barrier island systems develop most easily on wave-dominated coasts with a small to moderate tidal range. Coasts are classified into three groups based on [[tidal range]]: microtidal, 0\u20132 meter tidal range; mesotidal, 2\u20134 meter tidal range; and macrotidal, >4 meter tidal range. Barrier islands tend to form primarily along microtidal coasts, where they tend to be well developed and nearly continuous. They are less frequently formed in mesotidal coasts, where they are typically short with tidal inlets common. Barrier islands are very rare along macrotidal coasts.<ref>Boggs, S., Jr., 2012, ''Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy:'' New Jersey, Pearson Education, Inc., 585 p.</ref> Along with a small tidal range and a wave-dominated coast, there must be a relatively low gradient shelf. Otherwise, sand accumulation into a sandbar would not occur and instead would be dispersed throughout the shore. An ample sediment supply is also a requirement for barrier island formation.<ref name=\"Smith, Q.H.T. 2010, p. 292\"/> The last major requirement for barrier island formation is a stable sea level. It is especially important for sea level to remain relatively unchanged during barrier island formation and growth. If sea level changes are too drastic, time will be insufficient for wave action to accumulate sand into a dune, which will eventually become a barrier island through [[aggradation]]. The formation of barrier islands requires a constant sea level so that waves can concentrate the sand into one location.<ref>Coastal Services Center, [http://www.csc.noaa.gov/beachnourishment/html/geo/barrier.htm NOAA\u2019s Coastal Services Center Barrier Islands: Formation and Evolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808000000/http://www.csc.noaa.gov/beachnourishment/html/geo/barrier.htm |date=August 8, 2010 }}. Accessed April 10, 2011.</ref>\n\n===Offshore bar theory===\nIn 1845 the Frenchman [[Elie de Beaumont]] published an account of barrier formation. He believed that waves moving into shallow water churned up sand, which was deposited in the form of a submarine [[Bar (landform)|bar]] when the waves broke and lost much of their energy. As the bars developed vertically, they gradually rose above sea level, forming barrier islands.\n\n===Spit accretion theory===\nAmerican geologist [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] first argued in 1885 that the barrier sediments came from longshore sources. He proposed that sediment moving in the breaker zone through agitation by waves in [[longshore drift]] would construct [[Spit (landform)|spits]] extending from [[headlands]] parallel to the coast. The subsequent breaching of spits by storm waves would form barrier islands.<ref>Davis Jr., pp. 144\u2013145</ref>\n\n===Submergence theory===\n[[File:Isles Dernieres.gif|thumb|[[Last Island, Louisiana|Isles Dernieres]] in 1853 and 1978. Wave action detaches Isles Dernieres from the mainland.]]\n\n[[William John McGee]] reasoned in 1890 that the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf coasts]] of the [[United States]] were undergoing submergence, as evidenced by the many drowned river valleys that occur along these coasts, including [[Raritan Bay|Raritan]], [[Delaware Bay|Delaware]] and [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] bays. He believed that during submergence, coastal ridges were separated from the mainland, and lagoons formed behind the ridges.<ref>Davis Jr., p. 145</ref> He used the Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands (consists of [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|Ship]], [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn]], [[Petit Bois Island (Mississippi)|Petit Bois]] and [[Dauphin Island|Dauphin]] Islands) as an example where coastal submergence formed barrier islands. His interpretation was later shown to be incorrect when the ages of the coastal stratigraphy and sediment were more accurately determined.<ref>Morton, p. 2</ref>\n\nAlong the coast of [[Louisiana]], former lobes of the [[Mississippi River]] delta have been reworked by wave action, forming beach ridge complexes. Prolonged sinking of the marshes behind the barriers has converted these former vegetated wetlands to open-water areas. In a period of 125 years, from 1853 to 1978, two small semi-protected bays behind the barrier developed as the large water body of [[Lake Pelto]], leading to [[Isles Dernieres]]'s detachment from the mainland.<ref name = \"Davis 147\"/>\n\n===Boulder Bank===\nAn unusual natural structure in [[New Zealand]] may give clues to the formation processes of barrier islands. The [[Boulder Bank]], at the entrance to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson Haven]] at the northern end of the [[South Island]], is a unique 13&nbsp;km-long stretch of rocky substrate a few metres in width. It is not strictly a barrier island, as it is linked to the mainland at one end. The Boulder Bank is composed of [[granodiorite]] from Mackay Bluff, which lies close to the point where the bank joins the mainland. It is still debated what process or processes have resulted in this odd structure, though longshore drift is the most accepted hypothesis. Studies have been conducted since 1892 to determine the speed of boulder movement. Rates of the top-course gravel movement have been estimated at 7.5 metres a year.<ref name=\"Nelson Boulder Bank\">{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/00288306.2001.9514924 | author=M. R. Johnson| title=Nelson Boulder Bank| journal=New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics| year=2001| volume=44| pages=79\u201388}}</ref>\n\n== Ecological importance ==\nBarrier islands are critically important in mitigating ocean swells and other storm events for the water systems on the mainland side of the barrier island, as well as protecting the coastline. This effectively creates a unique environment of relatively low energy, [[brackish water]]. Multiple wetland systems such as lagoons, estuaries, and/or marshes can result from such conditions depending on the surroundings. They are typically rich habitats for a variety of flora and fauna. Without barrier islands, these wetlands could not exist; they would be destroyed by daily ocean waves and tides as well as ocean storm events. One of the most prominent examples is the [[Louisiana]] barrier islands.<ref>Stone, G.W., and McBride, R.A., 1998, \"Louisiana barrier islands and their importance in wetland protection: forecasting shoreline change and subsequent response of wave climate:\" ''Journal of Coastal Research,'' v. 14, p. 900\u2013915.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[North Frisian Barrier Island]](s)\n*[[Outer Banks]]\n*[[Virginia Barrier Islands]]\n*[[New York Barrier Islands]]\n*[[Texas barrier islands]]\n*[[Sea Islands]]\n*[[Long Beach Island]]\n*[[Bald Head Island, North Carolina|Bald Head Island]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last = Davis Jr. | first = Richard A. | last2 = FitzGerald | first2 = Duncan M. | title = Beaches and Coasts | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Blackwell Publishing]] | isbn = 978-0-632-04308-8 | location = United Kingdom}}\n* {{Citation | last = Morton | first = Robert A. | title = Historical Changes in the Mississippi-Alabama Barrier Islands and the Roles of Extreme Storms, Sea level, and human activities | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1161/OFR-2007-1161-screen.pdf | year = 2007 | publisher = U.

Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's [[magnetic field]] and [[electric current]] in a [[electromagnetic coil|wire winding]] to generate force in the form of [[torque]] applied on the motor's shaft. Electric motors can be powered by [[direct current]] (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by [[alternating current]] (AC) sources, such as a power grid, [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] or electrical generators. An [[electric generator]] is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates with a reversed flow of power, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nElectric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, internal construction, application and type of motion output. In addition to AC versus DC types, motors may be [[brushed motor|brushed]] or [[brushless motor|brushless]], may be of various phase (see [[single-phase]], [[two-phase electric power|two-phase]], or [[three-phase]]), and may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. General-purpose motors with standard dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors are found in industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches.\n\nIn certain applications, such as in [[regenerative braking]] with [[traction motor]]s, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.\n\nElectric motors produce linear or rotary force ([[torque]]) intended to propel some external mechanism, such as a fan or an elevator. An electric motor is generally designed for continuous rotation, or for linear movement over a significant distance compared to its size.  Magnetic [[solenoid]]s produce significant mechanical force, but over an operating distance comparable to their size. Transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones convert between electrical current and mechanical force to reproduce signals such as speech. When compared with common internal combustion engines (ICEs), electric motors are lightweight, physically smaller, provide more power output, are mechanically simpler and cheaper to build, while providing instant and consistent torque at any speed, with more responsiveness, higher overall efficiency and lower heat generation. However, electric motors are not as convenient or common as ICEs in mobile applications (i.e. cars and buses) as they require a large and expensive battery, while ICEs require a relatively small fuel tank.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n[[File:Rotterdam Ahoy Europort 2011 (14).JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Cutaway view through stator of induction motor.]]\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the electric motor}}\n\n===Early motors===\n[[File:Faraday magnetic rotation.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Faraday's electromagnetic experiment, 1821<ref name=\"Faraday (1822)\">{{cite journal|last=Faraday|first=Michael|title=On Some New Electro-Magnetical Motion, and on the Theory of Magnetism|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and the Arts|year=1822|volume=XII|pages=74\u201396 (\u00a7IX)|url=https://archive.org/details/quarterlyjournal12jour|accessdate=12 February 2013|publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain}}</ref>]]\n\nThe first electric motors were simple [[electrostatic motor|electrostatic]] devices described in experiments by Scottish monk [[Andrew Gordon (Benedictine)|Andrew Gordon]] and American experimenter [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the 1740s.<ref name=\"Gordon\">Tom McInally, The Sixth Scottish University.

Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by [[Thomas Edison]]), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided control systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887\u201388 in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently powered centrally-controlled cars. The latter were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the [[South Side Elevated Railroad]], where it became popularly known as the \"[[Chicago \"L\"|L]]\". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry.

[[Benjamin G. Lamme|B.G. Lamme]] later developed a rotating bar winding rotor.<ref name=\"Alger (1976)\"/>\n\nSteadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] invented the three-phase induction motor in 1889, of both types cage-rotor and wound rotor with a starting rheostat, and the three-limb [[transformer]] in 1890. After an agreement between AEG and Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, Doliwo-Dobrowolski and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]] developed larger models, namely a 20-hp squirrel cage and a 100-hp wound rotor with a starting rheostat. These were the first three-phase asynchronous motors suitable for practical operation.<ref name=\"acmachine\"/> Since 1889, similar developments of three-phase machinery were started Wenstr\u00f6m.\nAt the 1891 Frankfurt International Electrotechnical Exhibition, the first long distance three-phase system was successfully presented. It was rated 15 kV and extended over 175&nbsp;km from the Lauffen waterfall on the Neckar river. The Lauffen power station included a 240&nbsp;kW 86 V 40&nbsp;Hz alternator and a step-up transformer while at the exhibition a step-down transformer fed a 100-hp three-phase induction motor that powered an artificial waterfall, representing the transfer of the original power source.<ref name=\"acmachine\"/>\nThe three-phase induction is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hubbell|first=M.W.|year=2011|title=The Fundamentals of Nuclear Power Generation Questions & Answers.|publisher=Authorhouse|isbn=978-1-4634-2441-1|page=27|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"IEEE German Ch.

The rotor usually has conductors laid into it that carry currents, which interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft. Alternatively, some rotors carry permanent magnets, and the stator holds the conductors.\n\n===Bearings===\nThe rotor is supported by [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], which allow the rotor to turn on its axis.  The bearings are in turn supported by the motor housing.  The motor shaft extends through the bearings to the outside of the motor, where the load is applied.  Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be ''overhung''.<ref>{{cite web |title=How belt drives impact overhung load |publisher=Gates Corporation |date=2017 |url=http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222054609/http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Stator===\n{{main|Stator}}\nThe stator is the stationary part of the motor's electromagnetic circuit and usually consists of either windings or permanent magnets. The stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets, called laminations. Laminations are used to reduce energy losses that would result if a solid core were used. Resin-packed motors, used in washing machines and air conditioners, use the damping properties of resin (plastic) to reduce noise and vibration. These motors completely [[Potting (electronics)|encapsulate the stator in plastic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidec.com/en/technology/casestudy/resin_pack_motor/|title=Resin-Packed Motors|website=Nidec Corporation}}</ref>\n\n===Air gap===\nThe distance between the rotor and stator is called the air gap. The air gap has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong negative effect on performance. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate.  The magnetizing current increases with the air gap. For this reason, the air gap should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.\n\n[[File:Salient-pole rotor.png|thumb|right|Salient-pole rotor]]\n\n===Windings===\n{{main|Windings}}\nWindings are wires that are laid in [[electromagnetic coil|coils]], usually wrapped around a laminated soft iron [[magnetic core]] so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current.\n\nElectric machines come in two basic magnet field pole configurations: ''salient-'' and ''nonsalient-pole'' configurations. In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face. In the ''nonsalient-pole'', or distributed field, or round-rotor, machine, the winding is distributed in pole face slots.<ref name=\"Mortensen (1949)\">{{cite book|title=\u00a77-1 'General Picture of a Synchronous Machine' in Sec. 7 \u2013 Alternating-Current Generators and Motors|first=S.H.|last=Mortensen|last2=Beckwith |first2=S.|pages=646\u201347, figs. 7\u20131 & 7\u20132}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}</ref> A [[shaded-pole motor]] has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.\n\nSome motors have conductors that consist of thicker metal, such as bars or sheets of metal, usually [[copper]], alternatively [[aluminum]]. These are usually powered by [[electromagnetic induction]].\n\n===Commutator===\n{{main|Commutator (electric)}}\n[[File:Tiny motor windings - commutator - brushes in Zip Zaps toy R-C car.jpg|thumb|A toy's small DC motor with its commutator]]\nA [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] is a mechanism used to [[switch]] the input of most DC machines and certain AC machines. It consists of slip-ring segments insulated from each other and from the shaft. The motor's armature current is supplied through stationary [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal, and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] rotates from pole to pole.{{sfn|Hameyer|2001|p=  62}}<ref>Lynn, \u00a783, p. 812</ref> In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of improved technologies in the electronic-controller, sensorless-control, induction-motor, and permanent-magnet-motor fields, externally-commutated induction and [[permanent-magnet motor]]s are displacing electromechanically-commutated motors.\n\n==Motor supply and control==\n\n===Motor supply===\nA DC motor is usually supplied through a slip ring commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation can be achieved using either a slip ring commutator or external commutation, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. [[Universal motor]]s can run on either AC or DC.\n\n===Motor control===\nDC motors can be operated at variable speeds by adjusting the DC voltage applied to the terminals.\n\nAC motors operated at a fixed speed are generally powered directly from the grid or through [[Motor soft starter|motor soft starters]].\n\nAC motors operated at variable speeds are powered with various [[power inverter]], [[variable-frequency drive]] or electronic commutator technologies.\n\nThe term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated [[brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] and [[switched reluctance motor]] applications.\n\n==Major categories==\nElectric motors operate on three different physical principles: [[magnetism]], [[electrostatic motor|electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectric motor|piezoelectricity]]. By far, the most common is magnetism.\n\nIn magnetic motors, magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields gives rise to a force, and thus a torque on the motor shaft. One, or both, of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.\n\nThe main types are DC motors and AC motors,<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=blHcc6B8JO0C|page=82}}|title=Practical Guide to Blow Moulding|last=Lee|first=Norman C.|date=2006|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|p=82|isbn=978-1-85957-513-0|language=en}}</ref> the former increasingly being displaced by the latter. {{citation needed|reason=There are some applications in which the reverse is true, however, this editor found no concrete numbers one way or the other.|date=December 2015}}\n\nAC electric motors are either asynchronous or synchronous.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ewKqDQAAQBAJ|page=6}}|title=Electric Motor Control: DC, AC, and BLDC Motors|last=Kim|first=Sang-Hoon|year=2017|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=97-80128123195|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOnce started, a synchronous motor requires synchronism with the moving magnetic field's synchronous speed for all normal torque conditions.\n\nIn synchronous machines, the magnetic field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets.\n\nA [[fractional-horsepower motor]] motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower (0.746&nbsp;kW), or is manufactured with a standard-frame size smaller than a standard 1 HP motor.

(\"N\" and \"S\" designate polarities on the inside faces of the magnets; the outside faces have opposite polarities.)]]\nA commutated DC motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.\n\nThe rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, [[soft magnetic material|magnetically \"soft\"]] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an [[electromagnet]]). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (as a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.\n\nMany of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections\u2014and hence coil ends\u2014momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the [[inductance]] of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their [[resistivity]], limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates [[electrical noise]]; sparking generates [[Radio frequency interference|RFI]]. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.\n\nWhile most commutators are cylindrical, some are flat discs consisting of several segments (typically, at least three) mounted on an insulator.\n\nLarge brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.\n\nDC machines are defined as follows:<ref name=\"Dorf (1997)\">{{cite conference|editor-last=Dorf|editor-first=Richard C.

Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the \"dynamo\" type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.\n\nTo minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with [[neodymium]] or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed [[#Singly fed electric motor|singly-fed]] synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.\n\n===Electronic commutator (EC) motor===\n\n====Brushless DC motor====\n{{Main|Brushless DC electric motor}}\nSome of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in the BLDC design. In this motor, the mechanical \"rotating switch\" or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor's position. BLDC motors are typically 85\u201390% efficient or more. Efficiency for a BLDC motor of up to 96.5% have been reported,<ref name=\"Nozawa (2009)\">{{cite web|last=Nozawa|first=Tetsuo (2009)|title=Tokai University Unveils 100W DC Motor with 96% Efficiency|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|publisher=Tech-On \u2013 Nikkei Electronics|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101131311/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|archivedate=2011-01-01|df=}}</ref> whereas DC motors with brushgear are typically 75\u201380% efficient.\n\nThe BLDC motor's characteristic trapezoidal [[counter-electromotive force]] (CEMF) waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from the placement of the rotor's permanent magnets. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use [[Hall effect sensor]]s mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost [[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control]] of the electronic commutator.\n\nBLDC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary, as in computer disk drives or in video cassette recorders, the spindles within CD, CD-ROM (etc.) drives, and mechanisms within office products, such as fans, laser printers and photocopiers. They have several advantages over conventional motors:\n* Compared to AC fans using shaded-pole motors, they are very efficient, running much cooler than the equivalent AC motors. This cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan's bearings.\n* Without a commutator to wear out, the life of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a DC motor using brushes and a commutator. Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a commutator or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.\n* The same Hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also provide a convenient [[tachometer]] signal for closed-loop control (servo-controlled) applications. In fans, the tachometer signal can be used to derive a \"fan OK\" signal as well as provide running speed feedback.\n* The motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external clock, leading to precise speed control.\n* BLDC motors have no chance of sparking, unlike brushed motors, making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels. Also, sparking generates ozone, which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings risking harm to occupants' health.\n* BLDC motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to get rid of unwanted heat.\n* They are also acoustically very quiet motors, which is an advantage if being used in equipment that is affected by vibrations.\nModern BLDC motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors up to about 100&nbsp;kW rating are used in electric vehicles. They also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft.\n\n====Switched reluctance motor====\n[[File:Switched reluctance motor 6-4.svg|thumb|right|6/4 pole switched reluctance motor]]\n{{Main|Switched reluctance motor}}\n\nThe SRM has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents.\nInstead, torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator.\nThe rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field.\n\nThe magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the rotor turns, different windings will be energized, keeping the rotor turning.\n\nSRMs are used in some appliances<ref name=\"Bush (2009)\">{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Steve (2009) |title=Dyson vacuums 104,000&nbsp;rpm brushless DC technology |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |publisher=Electronics Weekly Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411205153/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |archivedate=2012-04-11 |df= }}</ref> and vehicles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/11/tesla-model-3-motor-in-depth/|title=Tesla Model 3 Motor \u2013 Everything I've Been Able To Learn About It (Welcome To The Machine) {{!}} CleanTechnica|last=|first=|date=March 11, 2018|website=cleantechnica.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Universal AC/DC motor===\n{{main|Universal motor}}\n[[File:Universalmotor 3.JPG|thumb|Modern low-cost universal motor, from a vacuum cleaner. Field windings are dark copper-colored, toward the back, on both sides. The rotor's laminated core is gray metallic, with dark slots for winding the coils. The commutator (partly hidden) has become dark from use; it is toward the front. The large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes (both sides), as well as the front motor bearing.]]\nA commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.\n\nOperating at normal [[utility frequency|power line frequencies]], universal motors are often found in a range less than {{nowrap|1000 watts}}. Universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in [[Railway electrification system#Low-frequency alternating current|electric railways]]. In this application, the use of AC to power a motor originally designed to run on DC would lead to efficiency losses due to [[eddy current]] heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron and they are now rarely used.\n\nAn advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to [[TRIAC#Application|electronic speed control]] and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.\n\nWhereas SCIMs cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency, universal motors can run at much higher speeds. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed {{nowrap|10,000 rpm}}, while many similar miniature grinders exceed {{nowrap|30,000 rpm}}.\n\n==Externally commutated AC machine==\n{{Main|AC motor}}\n\nThe design of AC induction and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC to produce a rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.\n\n===Induction motor===\n{{Main|Induction motor}}\n\n[[File:Elliott-Motor.jpg|thumb|Large 4,500 HP AC Induction Motor.]]\n\n====Cage and wound rotor induction motor====\nAn induction motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An induction motor resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.\n\nInduction motors may be further divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors and [[Wound rotor motor|Wound Rotor Induction Motors]] (WRIMs). SCIMs have a heavy winding made up of solid bars, usually aluminum or copper, electrically connected by rings at the ends of the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.\n\nCurrents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.\n\nIn a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to [[slip ring]]s on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.\n\nThe WRIM is used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.\n\nMotor speed can be changed because the torque curve of the motor is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque will be further reduced.\n\nWhen used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.\n\n====Torque motor====\n{{main|Torque motor}}\nA torque motor is a specialized form of electric motor that can operate indefinitely while stalled, that is, with the rotor blocked from turning, without incurring damage. In this mode of operation, the motor will apply a steady torque to the load (hence the name).\n\nA common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.\n\nAnother common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion [[engine]] in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.\n\n===Synchronous motor===\n{{Main|Synchronous motor}}\n\nA synchronous electric motor is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.\n\nFinally, hysteresis synchronous motors typically are (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it act like a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The rotor material, like that of a common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.\n\nLow-power synchronous timing motors (such as those for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole permanent magnet external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque. ''Telechron'' clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque, and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor.\n\n===Doubly-fed electric machine===\n{{Main|Doubly-fed electric machine}}\n\nDoubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) power to the energy conversion process, with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as [[singly-fed electric machine]]s, which have only one active winding set.\n\nA doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.<ref name=\"Lander (1993)\">{{cite conference|last=Lander|first=Cyril W.|title=\u00a79\u20138 'Slip Ring Induction Motor Control' in Chapter 9 \u2013 A.C.

If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the ''coreless or ironless DC motor'', a specialized form of a permanent magnet DC motor.<ref name=\"Wei\u03b2mantel (2008)\"/> Optimized for rapid [[acceleration]], these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.\n\nBecause the rotor is much lighter in weight (mass) than a conventional rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations, the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical [[time constant]] under one millisecond. This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air. Overheating might be an issue for coreless DC motor designs. Modern software, such as [[Motor-CAD]], can help to increase the thermal efficiency of motors while still in the design stage.\n\nAmong these types are the disc-rotor types, described in more detail in the next section.\n\nThe [[vibrating alert]] of cellular phones is sometimes generated by tiny cylindrical permanent-magnet field types, but there are also disc-shaped types that have a thin multipolar disc field magnet, and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils. Metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils.\n\nRelated limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin permanent magnets. These are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk (\"hard disk\") drives. Although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers, it is still loosely (and incorrectly) referred to as a \"voice coil\" structure, because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines, and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker.\n\n====Pancake or axial rotor motor====\nThe printed armature or pancake motor has the windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets. The magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor with space in between to form an axial air gap.<ref name=\"Krishnan (1987)\">{{cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=R.|title=Selection Criteria for Servo Motor Drives|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications|date=March 1987|volume=IA-23|issue=2|pages=270\u201375|doi=10.1109/TIA.1987.4504902|df=}}</ref> This design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its flat profile. The technology has had many brand names since its inception, such as ServoDisc.\n\nThe printed armature (originally formed on a printed circuit board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc. The printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in that it does not have a separate ring commutator. The brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact.\n\nAn alternative manufacturing method is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate, mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180&nbsp;\u00b0C, Class H rating.\n\nThe unique advantage of ironless DC motors is the absence of [[Cogging torque|cogging]] (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (>40&nbsp;kHz) or DC because of decreased [[electromagnetic induction]].\n\nThese motors were originally invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic tape drives, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.\n\nAnother approach (Magnax) is to use a single stator sandwiched between two rotors. One such design has produced peak power of 15&nbsp;kW/kg, sustained power around 7.5&nbsp;kW/kg. This yokeless axial flux motor offers a shorter flux path, keeping the magnets further from the axis. The design allows zero winding overhang; 100 percent of the windings are active. This is enhanced with the use of rectangular-section copper wire. The motors can be stacked to work in parallel. Instabilities are minimized by ensuring that the two rotor discs put equal and opposing forces onto the stator disc. The rotors are connected directly to one another via a shaft ring, cancelling out the magnetic forces.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/magnax-axial-flux-electric-motor/54821|title=Magnax prepares to manufacture radically high-powered, compact axial flux electric motor|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=May 30, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-06-18}}</ref>\n\nMagnax motors range in size from {{Convert|.15-5.4|m|}} in diameter.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Servo motor ====\n{{Main|Servo motor}}\nA servomotor is a motor, very often sold as a complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor permanent magnet synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.<ref name=\"Krishnan (1987)\"/>\n\nA servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running. A stepper system inherently operates open-loop\u2014relying on the motor not to \"miss steps\" for short term accuracy\u2014with any feedback such as a \"home\" switch or position encoder being external to the motor system.<ref name=\"Patrick (1997)\">{{cite conference|last=Patrick|first=Dale R.|author2=Fardo, Stephen W.|booktitle=Rotating Electrical Machines and Power Systems|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Fairmont Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88173-239-9|title=Chapter 11}}</ref> For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.\n\n====Stepper motor====\n{{Main|Stepper motor}}\n[[File:Stepper motor.svg|thumb|A stepper motor with a soft iron rotor, with active windings shown. In 'A' the active windings tend to hold the rotor in position. In 'B' a different set of windings are carrying a current, which generates torque and rotation.]]\nStepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing permanent magnets or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it \"steps\"\u2014starts and then quickly stops again\u2014from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.\n\nSimple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to \"cog\" to a limited number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly. This mode of operation is often called [[stepper motor#Microstepping|microstepping]]. Computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a digital [[servomechanism|servo-controlled]] system.\n\nStepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives\u2014the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive\u2014thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term \"voice coil\" in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.)\n\nStepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.\n\nSo-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors; they have one coil, draw very little power, and have a permanent magnet rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepping motor.\n\nClosely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs are classified as variable reluctance motor type.{{Sfn|Bose|2006|pp=569\u201370, 891}} Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and [[Numerical control|computer numerical control (CNC)]] machines such as routers, plasma cutters and CNC lathes.\n\n===Linear motor===\n{{Main|Linear motor}}\nA linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been \"unrolled\" so that, instead of producing a [[torque]] (rotation), it produces a straight-line force along its length.\n\nLinear motors are most commonly [[linear induction motor|induction motors]] or stepper motors. Linear motors are commonly found in many roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail. They are also used in [[maglev train]]s, where the train \"flies\" over the ground. On a smaller scale, the 1978 era HP 7225A pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the X and Y axes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fenoglio|first=John A.|author2=Chin, Bessie W.C.|author3=Cobb, Terry R.|title=A High-Quality Digital X-Y Plotter Designed for Reliability, Flexibility and Low Cost|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1979-02.pdf|journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal|date=February 1979|accessdate=9 February 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327132234/http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1979-02.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison by major categories==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of motor types\n|-\n!

This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called \"[[electromotive force|back electromotive force (emf)]]\". The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.<ref name=\"Dwight (1949)\">{{cite book|last=Dwight|first=Herbert B.|last2=Fink |first2=D.G.|title=\u00a727 to \u00a735A Electromagnetic Induction of EMF in Sec. 2 \u2013 Electric and Magnetic Circuits|pages=36\u201341}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}</ref>\n\nIn AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back emf source within the machine; as an example, this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs.<ref name=\"Dwight (1949)\"/>\n\n===Losses===\n[[Losses in electrical systems|Motor losses]] are mainly due to [[Joule heating|resistive losses]] in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.\n\nLosses also occur in commutation, mechanical commutators spark, and electronic commutators and also dissipate heat.\n\n===Efficiency===\nTo calculate a motor's efficiency, the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power:\n:<math>\\eta = \\frac{P_m}{P_e}</math>,\nwhere <math>\\eta</math> is [[energy conversion efficiency]], <math>P_e</math> is electrical input power, and <math>P_m</math> is mechanical output power:\n\n:<math>P_e = I V</math>\n\n:<math>P_m = T \\omega</math>\nwhere <math>V</math> is input voltage, <math>I</math> is input current, <math>T</math> is output torque, and <math>\\omega</math> is output angular velocity.

For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.\n\nOnce this is done a figure relating the current to the torque can be used as a useful parameter for motor selection. The maximum torque for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be only usable until thermal considerations take precedence.\n\nWhen optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic core saturation]] or safe [[operating temperature]] rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.\n\nCapacity for bursts of torque should not be confused with field weakening capability. Field weakening allows an electric machine to operate beyond the designed frequency of excitation. Field weakening is done when the maximum speed cannot be reached by increasing the applied voltage. This applies to only motors with current controlled fields and therefore cannot be achieved with permanent magnet motors.\n\nElectric machines without a transformer circuit topology, such as that of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless. Furthermore, the permanent magnet assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged, if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted.\n\nElectric machines with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.\n\nElectric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Still, bursts of torque that are two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.\n\nThe brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port).<ref name=\"Klatt (2012)\">{{cite book|last=Klatt|first=Frederick W.|title=Sensorless Real Time Control (RTC): Brushless Wound-Rotor [Synchronous] Doubly-Fed Machine|journal=Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives \u2013 SLED 2012|pages=1\u20136|date=September 2012|doi=10.1109/SLED.2012.6422811|publisher=IEEE|isbn=978-1-4673-2967-5}}</ref> The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.\n\n===Continuous torque density===\nThe continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or permanent magnet damage.\n\nOther sources state that various e-machine topologies have differing torque density.

Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although very small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Today, the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems ([[MEMS]]) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. Also, the molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nA piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric material]] when an [[electric field]] is applied.

Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's [[magnetic field]] and [[electric current]] in a [[electromagnetic coil|wire winding]] to generate force in the form of [[torque]] applied on the motor's shaft. Electric motors can be powered by [[direct current]] (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by [[alternating current]] (AC) sources, such as a power grid, [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] or electrical generators. An [[electric generator]] is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates with a reversed flow of power, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nElectric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, internal construction, application and type of motion output. In addition to AC versus DC types, motors may be [[brushed motor|brushed]] or [[brushless motor|brushless]], may be of various phase (see [[single-phase]], [[two-phase electric power|two-phase]], or [[three-phase]]), and may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled. General-purpose motors with standard dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors are found in industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches.\n\nIn certain applications, such as in [[regenerative braking]] with [[traction motor]]s, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.\n\nElectric motors produce linear or rotary force ([[torque]]) intended to propel some external mechanism, such as a fan or an elevator. An electric motor is generally designed for continuous rotation, or for linear movement over a significant distance compared to its size.  Magnetic [[solenoid]]s produce significant mechanical force, but over an operating distance comparable to their size. Transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones convert between electrical current and mechanical force to reproduce signals such as speech. When compared with common internal combustion engines (ICEs), electric motors are lightweight, physically smaller, provide more power output, are mechanically simpler and cheaper to build, while providing instant and consistent torque at any speed, with more responsiveness, higher overall efficiency and lower heat generation. However, electric motors are not as convenient or common as ICEs in mobile applications (i.e. cars and buses) as they require a large and expensive battery, while ICEs require a relatively small fuel tank.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n[[File:Rotterdam Ahoy Europort 2011 (14).JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Cutaway view through stator of induction motor.]]\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the electric motor}}\n\n===Early motors===\n[[File:Faraday magnetic rotation.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Faraday's electromagnetic experiment, 1821<ref name=\"Faraday (1822)\">{{cite journal|last=Faraday|first=Michael|title=On Some New Electro-Magnetical Motion, and on the Theory of Magnetism|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and the Arts|year=1822|volume=XII|pages=74\u201396 (\u00a7IX)|url=https://archive.org/details/quarterlyjournal12jour|accessdate=12 February 2013|publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain}}</ref>]]\n\nThe first electric motors were simple [[electrostatic motor|electrostatic]] devices described in experiments by Scottish monk [[Andrew Gordon (Benedictine)|Andrew Gordon]] and American experimenter [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the 1740s.<ref name=\"Gordon\">Tom McInally, The Sixth Scottish University.

Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by [[Thomas Edison]]), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided control systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887\u201388 in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently powered centrally-controlled cars. The latter were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the [[South Side Elevated Railroad]], where it became popularly known as the \"[[Chicago \"L\"|L]]\". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of an air gap between the rotor and stator.

[[Benjamin G. Lamme|B.G. Lamme]] later developed a rotating bar winding rotor.<ref name=\"Alger (1976)\"/>\n\nSteadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] invented the three-phase induction motor in 1889, of both types cage-rotor and wound rotor with a starting rheostat, and the three-limb [[transformer]] in 1890. After an agreement between AEG and Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, Doliwo-Dobrowolski and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]] developed larger models, namely a 20-hp squirrel cage and a 100-hp wound rotor with a starting rheostat. These were the first three-phase asynchronous motors suitable for practical operation.<ref name=\"acmachine\"/> Since 1889, similar developments of three-phase machinery were started Wenstr\u00f6m.\nAt the 1891 Frankfurt International Electrotechnical Exhibition, the first long distance three-phase system was successfully presented. It was rated 15 kV and extended over 175&nbsp;km from the Lauffen waterfall on the Neckar river. The Lauffen power station included a 240&nbsp;kW 86 V 40&nbsp;Hz alternator and a step-up transformer while at the exhibition a step-down transformer fed a 100-hp three-phase induction motor that powered an artificial waterfall, representing the transfer of the original power source.<ref name=\"acmachine\"/>\nThe three-phase induction is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hubbell|first=M.W.|year=2011|title=The Fundamentals of Nuclear Power Generation Questions & Answers.|publisher=Authorhouse|isbn=978-1-4634-2441-1|page=27|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"IEEE German Ch.

The rotor usually has conductors laid into it that carry currents, which interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft. Alternatively, some rotors carry permanent magnets, and the stator holds the conductors.\n\n===Bearings===\nThe rotor is supported by [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], which allow the rotor to turn on its axis.  The bearings are in turn supported by the motor housing.  The motor shaft extends through the bearings to the outside of the motor, where the load is applied.  Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be ''overhung''.<ref>{{cite web |title=How belt drives impact overhung load |publisher=Gates Corporation |date=2017 |url=http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222054609/http://designcenter.gates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gates-How-Belt-Drives-Impact-Overhung-Load-White-Paper.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Stator===\n{{main|Stator}}\nThe stator is the stationary part of the motor's electromagnetic circuit and usually consists of either windings or permanent magnets. The stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets, called laminations. Laminations are used to reduce energy losses that would result if a solid core were used. Resin-packed motors, used in washing machines and air conditioners, use the damping properties of resin (plastic) to reduce noise and vibration. These motors completely [[Potting (electronics)|encapsulate the stator in plastic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidec.com/en/technology/casestudy/resin_pack_motor/|title=Resin-Packed Motors|website=Nidec Corporation}}</ref>\n\n===Air gap===\nThe distance between the rotor and stator is called the air gap. The air gap has important effects, and is generally as small as possible, as a large gap has a strong negative effect on performance. It is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operate.  The magnetizing current increases with the air gap. For this reason, the air gap should be minimal. Very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses.\n\n[[File:Salient-pole rotor.png|thumb|right|Salient-pole rotor]]\n\n===Windings===\n{{main|Windings}}\nWindings are wires that are laid in [[electromagnetic coil|coils]], usually wrapped around a laminated soft iron [[magnetic core]] so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current.\n\nElectric machines come in two basic magnet field pole configurations: ''salient-'' and ''nonsalient-pole'' configurations. In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face. In the ''nonsalient-pole'', or distributed field, or round-rotor, machine, the winding is distributed in pole face slots.<ref name=\"Mortensen (1949)\">{{cite book|title=\u00a77-1 'General Picture of a Synchronous Machine' in Sec. 7 \u2013 Alternating-Current Generators and Motors|first=S.H.|last=Mortensen|last2=Beckwith |first2=S.|pages=646\u201347, figs. 7\u20131 & 7\u20132}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}</ref> A [[shaded-pole motor]] has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.\n\nSome motors have conductors that consist of thicker metal, such as bars or sheets of metal, usually [[copper]], alternatively [[aluminum]]. These are usually powered by [[electromagnetic induction]].\n\n===Commutator===\n{{main|Commutator (electric)}}\n[[File:Tiny motor windings - commutator - brushes in Zip Zaps toy R-C car.jpg|thumb|A toy's small DC motor with its commutator]]\nA [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] is a mechanism used to [[switch]] the input of most DC machines and certain AC machines. It consists of slip-ring segments insulated from each other and from the shaft. The motor's armature current is supplied through stationary [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal, and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] rotates from pole to pole.{{sfn|Hameyer|2001|p=  62}}<ref>Lynn, \u00a783, p. 812</ref> In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of improved technologies in the electronic-controller, sensorless-control, induction-motor, and permanent-magnet-motor fields, externally-commutated induction and [[permanent-magnet motor]]s are displacing electromechanically-commutated motors.\n\n==Motor supply and control==\n\n===Motor supply===\nA DC motor is usually supplied through a slip ring commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation can be achieved using either a slip ring commutator or external commutation, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. [[Universal motor]]s can run on either AC or DC.\n\n===Motor control===\nDC motors can be operated at variable speeds by adjusting the DC voltage applied to the terminals.\n\nAC motors operated at a fixed speed are generally powered directly from the grid or through [[Motor soft starter|motor soft starters]].\n\nAC motors operated at variable speeds are powered with various [[power inverter]], [[variable-frequency drive]] or electronic commutator technologies.\n\nThe term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated [[brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motor]] and [[switched reluctance motor]] applications.\n\n==Major categories==\nElectric motors operate on three different physical principles: [[magnetism]], [[electrostatic motor|electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectric motor|piezoelectricity]]. By far, the most common is magnetism.\n\nIn magnetic motors, magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields gives rise to a force, and thus a torque on the motor shaft. One, or both, of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.\n\nThe main types are DC motors and AC motors,<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=blHcc6B8JO0C|page=82}}|title=Practical Guide to Blow Moulding|last=Lee|first=Norman C.|date=2006|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|p=82|isbn=978-1-85957-513-0|language=en}}</ref> the former increasingly being displaced by the latter. {{citation needed|reason=There are some applications in which the reverse is true, however, this editor found no concrete numbers one way or the other.|date=December 2015}}\n\nAC electric motors are either asynchronous or synchronous.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ewKqDQAAQBAJ|page=6}}|title=Electric Motor Control: DC, AC, and BLDC Motors|last=Kim|first=Sang-Hoon|year=2017|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=97-80128123195|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOnce started, a synchronous motor requires synchronism with the moving magnetic field's synchronous speed for all normal torque conditions.\n\nIn synchronous machines, the magnetic field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets.\n\nA [[fractional-horsepower motor]] motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower (0.746&nbsp;kW), or is manufactured with a standard-frame size smaller than a standard 1 HP motor.

(\"N\" and \"S\" designate polarities on the inside faces of the magnets; the outside faces have opposite polarities.)]]\nA commutated DC motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.\n\nThe rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, [[soft magnetic material|magnetically \"soft\"]] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an [[electromagnet]]). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (as a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.\n\nMany of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections\u2014and hence coil ends\u2014momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the [[inductance]] of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their [[resistivity]], limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates [[electrical noise]]; sparking generates [[Radio frequency interference|RFI]]. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.\n\nWhile most commutators are cylindrical, some are flat discs consisting of several segments (typically, at least three) mounted on an insulator.\n\nLarge brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output, but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.\n\nDC machines are defined as follows:<ref name=\"Dorf (1997)\">{{cite conference|editor-last=Dorf|editor-first=Richard C.

Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the \"dynamo\" type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.\n\nTo minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with [[neodymium]] or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed [[#Singly fed electric motor|singly-fed]] synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.\n\n===Electronic commutator (EC) motor===\n\n====Brushless DC motor====\n{{Main|Brushless DC electric motor}}\nSome of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in the BLDC design. In this motor, the mechanical \"rotating switch\" or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor's position. BLDC motors are typically 85\u201390% efficient or more. Efficiency for a BLDC motor of up to 96.5% have been reported,<ref name=\"Nozawa (2009)\">{{cite web|last=Nozawa|first=Tetsuo (2009)|title=Tokai University Unveils 100W DC Motor with 96% Efficiency|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|publisher=Tech-On \u2013 Nikkei Electronics|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101131311/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090403/168295/|archivedate=2011-01-01|df=}}</ref> whereas DC motors with brushgear are typically 75\u201380% efficient.\n\nThe BLDC motor's characteristic trapezoidal [[counter-electromotive force]] (CEMF) waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from the placement of the rotor's permanent magnets. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be with single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use [[Hall effect sensor]]s mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost [[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control]] of the electronic commutator.\n\nBLDC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary, as in computer disk drives or in video cassette recorders, the spindles within CD, CD-ROM (etc.) drives, and mechanisms within office products, such as fans, laser printers and photocopiers. They have several advantages over conventional motors:\n* Compared to AC fans using shaded-pole motors, they are very efficient, running much cooler than the equivalent AC motors. This cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan's bearings.\n* Without a commutator to wear out, the life of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a DC motor using brushes and a commutator. Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a commutator or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.\n* The same Hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also provide a convenient [[tachometer]] signal for closed-loop control (servo-controlled) applications. In fans, the tachometer signal can be used to derive a \"fan OK\" signal as well as provide running speed feedback.\n* The motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external clock, leading to precise speed control.\n* BLDC motors have no chance of sparking, unlike brushed motors, making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels. Also, sparking generates ozone, which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings risking harm to occupants' health.\n* BLDC motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to get rid of unwanted heat.\n* They are also acoustically very quiet motors, which is an advantage if being used in equipment that is affected by vibrations.\nModern BLDC motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors up to about 100&nbsp;kW rating are used in electric vehicles. They also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft.\n\n====Switched reluctance motor====\n[[File:Switched reluctance motor 6-4.svg|thumb|right|6/4 pole switched reluctance motor]]\n{{Main|Switched reluctance motor}}\n\nThe SRM has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents.\nInstead, torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator.\nThe rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field.\n\nThe magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the rotor turns, different windings will be energized, keeping the rotor turning.\n\nSRMs are used in some appliances<ref name=\"Bush (2009)\">{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Steve (2009) |title=Dyson vacuums 104,000&nbsp;rpm brushless DC technology |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |publisher=Electronics Weekly Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411205153/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/13/08/2010/46377/dyson-vacuums-104000rpm-brushless-dc-technology.htm |archivedate=2012-04-11 |df= }}</ref> and vehicles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/11/tesla-model-3-motor-in-depth/|title=Tesla Model 3 Motor \u2013 Everything I've Been Able To Learn About It (Welcome To The Machine) {{!}} CleanTechnica|last=|first=|date=March 11, 2018|website=cleantechnica.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Universal AC/DC motor===\n{{main|Universal motor}}\n[[File:Universalmotor 3.JPG|thumb|Modern low-cost universal motor, from a vacuum cleaner. Field windings are dark copper-colored, toward the back, on both sides. The rotor's laminated core is gray metallic, with dark slots for winding the coils. The commutator (partly hidden) has become dark from use; it is toward the front. The large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes (both sides), as well as the front motor bearing.]]\nA commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.\n\nOperating at normal [[utility frequency|power line frequencies]], universal motors are often found in a range less than {{nowrap|1000 watts}}. Universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in [[Railway electrification system#Low-frequency alternating current|electric railways]]. In this application, the use of AC to power a motor originally designed to run on DC would lead to efficiency losses due to [[eddy current]] heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron and they are now rarely used.\n\nAn advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to [[TRIAC#Application|electronic speed control]] and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.\n\nWhereas SCIMs cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency, universal motors can run at much higher speeds. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed {{nowrap|10,000 rpm}}, while many similar miniature grinders exceed {{nowrap|30,000 rpm}}.\n\n==Externally commutated AC machine==\n{{Main|AC motor}}\n\nThe design of AC induction and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC to produce a rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.\n\n===Induction motor===\n{{Main|Induction motor}}\n\n[[File:Elliott-Motor.jpg|thumb|Large 4,500 HP AC Induction Motor.]]\n\n====Cage and wound rotor induction motor====\nAn induction motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An induction motor resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.\n\nInduction motors may be further divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors and [[Wound rotor motor|Wound Rotor Induction Motors]] (WRIMs). SCIMs have a heavy winding made up of solid bars, usually aluminum or copper, electrically connected by rings at the ends of the rotor. When one considers only the bars and rings as a whole, they are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage, hence the name.\n\nCurrents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.\n\nIn a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to [[slip ring]]s on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.\n\nThe WRIM is used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.\n\nMotor speed can be changed because the torque curve of the motor is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque will be further reduced.\n\nWhen used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.\n\n====Torque motor====\n{{main|Torque motor}}\nA torque motor is a specialized form of electric motor that can operate indefinitely while stalled, that is, with the rotor blocked from turning, without incurring damage. In this mode of operation, the motor will apply a steady torque to the load (hence the name).\n\nA common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.\n\nAnother common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion [[engine]] in conjunction with an electronic governor. In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.\n\n===Synchronous motor===\n{{Main|Synchronous motor}}\n\nA synchronous electric motor is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.\n\nFinally, hysteresis synchronous motors typically are (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it act like a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The rotor material, like that of a common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.\n\nLow-power synchronous timing motors (such as those for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole permanent magnet external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque. ''Telechron'' clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque, and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor.\n\n===Doubly-fed electric machine===\n{{Main|Doubly-fed electric machine}}\n\nDoubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) power to the energy conversion process, with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as [[singly-fed electric machine]]s, which have only one active winding set.\n\nA doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.<ref name=\"Lander (1993)\">{{cite conference|last=Lander|first=Cyril W.|title=\u00a79\u20138 'Slip Ring Induction Motor Control' in Chapter 9 \u2013 A.C.

If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the ''coreless or ironless DC motor'', a specialized form of a permanent magnet DC motor.<ref name=\"Wei\u03b2mantel (2008)\"/> Optimized for rapid [[acceleration]], these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.\n\nBecause the rotor is much lighter in weight (mass) than a conventional rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations, the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical [[time constant]] under one millisecond. This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air. Overheating might be an issue for coreless DC motor designs. Modern software, such as [[Motor-CAD]], can help to increase the thermal efficiency of motors while still in the design stage.\n\nAmong these types are the disc-rotor types, described in more detail in the next section.\n\nThe [[vibrating alert]] of cellular phones is sometimes generated by tiny cylindrical permanent-magnet field types, but there are also disc-shaped types that have a thin multipolar disc field magnet, and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils. Metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils.\n\nRelated limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin permanent magnets. These are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk (\"hard disk\") drives. Although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers, it is still loosely (and incorrectly) referred to as a \"voice coil\" structure, because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines, and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker.\n\n====Pancake or axial rotor motor====\nThe printed armature or pancake motor has the windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets. The magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor with space in between to form an axial air gap.<ref name=\"Krishnan (1987)\">{{cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=R.|title=Selection Criteria for Servo Motor Drives|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications|date=March 1987|volume=IA-23|issue=2|pages=270\u201375|doi=10.1109/TIA.1987.4504902|df=}}</ref> This design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its flat profile. The technology has had many brand names since its inception, such as ServoDisc.\n\nThe printed armature (originally formed on a printed circuit board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc. The printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in that it does not have a separate ring commutator. The brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact.\n\nAn alternative manufacturing method is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate, mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180&nbsp;\u00b0C, Class H rating.\n\nThe unique advantage of ironless DC motors is the absence of [[Cogging torque|cogging]] (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (>40&nbsp;kHz) or DC because of decreased [[electromagnetic induction]].\n\nThese motors were originally invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic tape drives, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.\n\nAnother approach (Magnax) is to use a single stator sandwiched between two rotors. One such design has produced peak power of 15&nbsp;kW/kg, sustained power around 7.5&nbsp;kW/kg. This yokeless axial flux motor offers a shorter flux path, keeping the magnets further from the axis. The design allows zero winding overhang; 100 percent of the windings are active. This is enhanced with the use of rectangular-section copper wire. The motors can be stacked to work in parallel. Instabilities are minimized by ensuring that the two rotor discs put equal and opposing forces onto the stator disc. The rotors are connected directly to one another via a shaft ring, cancelling out the magnetic forces.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/magnax-axial-flux-electric-motor/54821|title=Magnax prepares to manufacture radically high-powered, compact axial flux electric motor|last=Blain|first=Loz|date=May 30, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2018-06-18}}</ref>\n\nMagnax motors range in size from {{Convert|.15-5.4|m|}} in diameter.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Servo motor ====\n{{Main|Servo motor}}\nA servomotor is a motor, very often sold as a complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor permanent magnet synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.<ref name=\"Krishnan (1987)\"/>\n\nA servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running. A stepper system inherently operates open-loop\u2014relying on the motor not to \"miss steps\" for short term accuracy\u2014with any feedback such as a \"home\" switch or position encoder being external to the motor system.<ref name=\"Patrick (1997)\">{{cite conference|last=Patrick|first=Dale R.|author2=Fardo, Stephen W.|booktitle=Rotating Electrical Machines and Power Systems|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Fairmont Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88173-239-9|title=Chapter 11}}</ref> For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping.

In 'B' a different set of windings are carrying a current, which generates torque and rotation.]]\nStepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing permanent magnets or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it \"steps\"\u2014starts and then quickly stops again\u2014from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.\n\nSimple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to \"cog\" to a limited number of positions; more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly. This mode of operation is often called [[stepper motor#Microstepping|microstepping]]. Computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems, particularly when part of a digital [[servomechanism|servo-controlled]] system.\n\nStepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives\u2014the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive\u2014thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term \"voice coil\" in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.)\n\nStepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.\n\nSo-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors; they have one coil, draw very little power, and have a permanent magnet rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepping motor.\n\nClosely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs are classified as variable reluctance motor type.{{Sfn|Bose|2006|pp=569\u201370, 891}} Stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and [[Numerical control|computer numerical control (CNC)]] machines such as routers, plasma cutters and CNC lathes.\n\n===Linear motor===\n{{Main|Linear motor}}\nA linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been \"unrolled\" so that, instead of producing a [[torque]] (rotation), it produces a straight-line force along its length.\n\nLinear motors are most commonly [[linear induction motor|induction motors]] or stepper motors. Linear motors are commonly found in many roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail. They are also used in [[maglev train]]s, where the train \"flies\" over the ground. On a smaller scale, the 1978 era HP 7225A pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the X and Y axes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fenoglio|first=John A.|author2=Chin, Bessie W.C.|author3=Cobb, Terry R.|title=A High-Quality Digital X-Y Plotter Designed for Reliability, Flexibility and Low Cost|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1979-02.pdf|journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal|date=February 1979|accessdate=9 February 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327132234/http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1979-02.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison by major categories==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of motor types\n|-\n!

This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called \"[[electromotive force|back electromotive force (emf)]]\". The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back emf results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load.<ref name=\"Dwight (1949)\">{{cite book|last=Dwight|first=Herbert B.|last2=Fink |first2=D.G.|title=\u00a727 to \u00a735A Electromagnetic Induction of EMF in Sec. 2 \u2013 Electric and Magnetic Circuits|pages=36\u201341}} in {{harvnb|Knowlton|1949}}</ref>\n\nIn AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back emf source within the machine; as an example, this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs.<ref name=\"Dwight (1949)\"/>\n\n===Losses===\n[[Losses in electrical systems|Motor losses]] are mainly due to [[Joule heating|resistive losses]] in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.\n\nLosses also occur in commutation, mechanical commutators spark, and electronic commutators and also dissipate heat.\n\n===Efficiency===\nTo calculate a motor's efficiency, the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power:\n:<math>\\eta = \\frac{P_m}{P_e}</math>,\nwhere <math>\\eta</math> is [[energy conversion efficiency]], <math>P_e</math> is electrical input power, and <math>P_m</math> is mechanical output power:\n\n:<math>P_e = I V</math>\n\n:<math>P_m = T \\omega</math>\nwhere <math>V</math> is input voltage, <math>I</math> is input current, <math>T</math> is output torque, and <math>\\omega</math> is output angular velocity.

However, the equation only directly relates to non PM motors.\n\n==Performance parameters==\n\n===Torque capability of motor types===\n{{generalize|section|date=March 2012}}\nAll the electromagnetic motors, and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.\n\nOnce this is done a figure relating the current to the torque can be used as a useful parameter for motor selection. The maximum torque for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be only usable until thermal considerations take precedence.\n\nWhen optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic core saturation]] or safe [[operating temperature]] rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.\n\nCapacity for bursts of torque should not be confused with field weakening capability. Field weakening allows an electric machine to operate beyond the designed frequency of excitation. Field weakening is done when the maximum speed cannot be reached by increasing the applied voltage. This applies to only motors with current controlled fields and therefore cannot be achieved with permanent magnet motors.\n\nElectric machines without a transformer circuit topology, such as that of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless. Furthermore, the permanent magnet assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged, if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted.\n\nElectric machines with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.\n\nElectric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Still, bursts of torque that are two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.\n\nThe brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port).<ref name=\"Klatt (2012)\">{{cite book|last=Klatt|first=Frederick W.|title=Sensorless Real Time Control (RTC): Brushless Wound-Rotor [Synchronous] Doubly-Fed Machine|journal=Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives \u2013 SLED 2012|pages=1\u20136|date=September 2012|doi=10.1109/SLED.2012.6422811|publisher=IEEE|isbn=978-1-4673-2967-5}}</ref> The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.\n\n===Continuous torque density===\nThe continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or permanent magnet damage.\n\nOther sources state that various e-machine topologies have differing torque density.

Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although very small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Today, the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems ([[MEMS]]) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. Also, the molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nA piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric material]] when an [[electric field]] is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or [[ultrasonic motor|ultrasonic]] vibrations to produce linear or rotary motion.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IdCg2dDZQr8C|page=38}}|title=Ultra-fast Material Metrology|last=Horn|first=Alexander|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-3-527-62793-6|language=en}}</ref> In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series of stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shafik|first1=Amro|last2=Ben Mrad|first2=Ridha|title=Nanopositioning Technologies: Fundamentals and Applications|date=2016|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-23853-1|page=39|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23853-1_2}}</ref>\n\nAn electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electric motor technology to propel spacecraft in outer space, most systems being based on electrically powering propellant to high speed, with some systems being based on [[electrodynamic tether]]s principles of propulsion to the magnetosphere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tethers.com/LaunchAssist.html|title=Launch Assist Tethers|website=www.tethers.com|access-date=2017-09-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116050844/http://www.tethers.com/LaunchAssist.html|archivedate=2017-11-16|df=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics|Energy}}\n* [[Electric generator]]\n* [[Regenerative brake]]\n* [[Goodness factor]]\n* [[Motor capacitor]]\n* [[Traction motor]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bmfgtgEACAAJ}}|title=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers|last=Fink|first=Donald G.|authorlink=Donald G.
