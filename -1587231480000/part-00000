The device may be electronic, mechanical, or a combination of the two ([[electromechanical]]). The noun derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f41\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''hod\u00f3metron'',  from {{lang|grc|\u1f41\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2}}, ''hod\u00f3s''  (\"path\" or \"gateway\") and {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''m\u00e9tron'' (\"measure\"). Early forms of the odometer existed in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] as well as in [[ancient China]]. In countries using [[Imperial units]] or [[US customary units]]  it is sometimes called a '''mileometer''' or '''milometer''', the former name especially being prevalent in the [[United Kingdom]] and among members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].{{dubious|date= July 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n{{for|a detailed list of the recorded distances by Alexander's bematists|Bematist}}\n=== Classical Era ===\n[[File:Hero's odometer, 1st century AD, Alexandria (reconstruction).jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]]'s odometer, 1st century AD, Alexandria, [[Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum]]]]\nPossibly the first evidence for the use of an odometer can be found in the works of the ancient Roman [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (NH 6. 61-62) and the ancient Greek [[Strabo]] (11.8.9). Both authors list the distances of routes traveled by [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336-323 BC) as by his [[bematist]]s Diognetus and Baeton. However, the high accuracy of the bematists's measurements rather indicates the use of a mechanical device. For example, the section between the cities Hecatompylos and Alexandria Areion, which later became a part of the [[silk road]], was given by Alexander's bematists as 529 [[Mile|English miles]] long, that is with a deviation of 0.2% from the actual distance (531 English miles). From the nine surviving bematists' measurements in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' eight show a deviation of less than 5% from the actual distance, three of them being within 1%. Since these minor discrepancies can be adequately explained by slight changes in the tracks of roads during the last 2300 years, the overall accuracy of the measurements implies that the bematists already must have used a sophisticated device for measuring distances, although there is no direct mention of such a device.\n\nAn odometer for measuring distance was first described by [[Vitruvius]] around 27 and 23 BC, although the actual inventor may have been [[Archimedes of Syracuse]] (c. 287 BC \u2013 c. 212 BC) during the [[First Punic War]]. [[Hero of Alexandria]] (10 AD \u2013 70 AD) describes a similar device in chapter 34 of his ''[[Dioptra]]''. The machine was also used in the time of Roman Emperor [[Commodus]] (c. 192 AD), although after this point in time there seems to be a gap between its use in Roman times and that of the 15th century in Western Europe.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=285}}  Some researchers have speculated that the device might have included technology similar to that of the Greek [[Antikythera mechanism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated188\">{{cite journal | bibcode=1981SciAm.245d.188S | title=Vitruvius' Odometer | date=October 1981 | last=Sleeswyk | first=Andr\u00e9 Wegener | journal=[[Scientific American]] | volume=245 | issue=4 | pages=188\u2013200 | issn=0036-8733 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1081-188}}</ref>\n\nThe odometer of Vitruvius was based on chariot wheels of {{Cvt|4|ft}} diameter turning 400 times in one Roman [[mile]] (about 1400&nbsp;m). For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference, where pebbles (''[[calculus]]'') were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by counting the number of pebbles.<ref name=\"autogenerated188\" />  Whether this instrument was ever built at the time is disputed. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] later tried to build it himself according to the description, but failed.  However, in 1981 engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica, replacing the square-toothed gear designs of da Vinci with the triangular, pointed teeth found in the ''Antikythera mechanism''.  With this modification, the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly.<ref name=\"autogenerated188\" />\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n[[File:Han dynasty odometer cart.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Han Dynasty]] stone rubbing of a horse-drawn odometer cart.]]\n==== Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period ====\nThe odometer was also independently invented in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]],{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} possibly by the prolific inventor and early scientist [[Zhang Heng]] (78 AD \u2013 139 AD) of the [[Han Dynasty]]. By the 3rd century (during the [[Three Kingdoms]] Period), the Chinese had termed the device as the 'j\u00ec l\u012d g\u016d ch\u0113' (\u8a18\u91cc\u9f13\u8eca), or '[[li (unit)|li]]-recording drum carriage' (Note: the modern measurement of li = {{Cvt|1640|ft|order=flip}}).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=281}} Chinese texts of the 3rd century tell of the mechanical carriage's functions, and as one li is traversed, a mechanical-driven wooden figure strikes a drum, and when ten li is traversed, another wooden figure would strike a gong or a bell with its mechanical-operated arm.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=281}}\n\nDespite its association with Zhang Heng or even the later [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200\u2013265), there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered around the ''huang men'' court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) that would follow the musical procession of the royal 'drum-chariot'.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}} The historian [[Joseph Needham]] asserts that it is no surprise this social group would have been responsible for such a device, since there is already other evidence of their craftsmanship with mechanical toys to delight the emperor and the court. There is speculation that some time in the 1st century BC (during the Western Han Dynasty), the beating of drums and gongs were mechanically-driven by working automatically off the rotation of the road-wheels.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}} This might have actually been the design of one Loxia Hong (c. 110 BC), yet by 125 AD the mechanical odometer carriage in China was already known (depicted in a mural of the [[Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine|Xiaotangshan Tomb]]).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n\nThe odometer was used also in subsequent periods of Chinese history. In the historical text of the ''[[Book of Jin|Jin Shu]]'' (635 AD), the oldest part of the compiled text, the book known as the ''Cui Bao'' (c. 300 AD), recorded the use of the odometer, providing description (attributing it to the Western Han era, from 202 BC\u20139 AD).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=282}} The passage in the ''Jin Shu'' expanded upon this, explaining that it took a similar form to the mechanical device of the [[south-pointing chariot]] invented by [[Ma Jun]] (200\u2013265, see also [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear). As recorded in the ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'' of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the odometer and south-pointing chariot were combined into one wheeled device by engineers of the 9th century, 11th century, and 12th century. The ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' (Master Sun's Mathematical Manual), dated from the 3rd century to 5th century, presented a mathematical problem for students involving the odometer. It involved a given distance between two cities, the small distance needed for one rotation of the carriage's wheel, and the posed question of how many rotations the wheels would have in all if the carriage was to travel between point A and B.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=282}}\n\n==== Song Dynasty ====\nThe historical text of the ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'' (1345 AD), recording the people and events of the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279), also mentioned the odometer used in that period. However, unlike written sources of earlier periods, it provided a much more thoroughly detailed description of the device that harkens back to its ancient form ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):\n\n<blockquote>\nThe odometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, handsomely adorned with carvings. At the completion of every li, the wooden figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum; at the completion of every ten li, the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell. The carriage-pole ends in a phoenix-head, and the carriage is drawn by four horses. The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yung-Hsi reign-period (987 AD) [[Emperor Taizong of Song|the emperor Thai Tsung]] increased it to 30. In the 5th year of the Thien-Sheng reign-period (1027 AD) the Chief Chamberlain Lu Tao-lung presented specifications for the construction of odometers as follows:{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears, along with a concluding description at the end of how the device ultimately functions:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe vehicle should have a single pole and two wheels. On the body are two storeys, each containing a carved wooden figure holding a drumstick. The road-wheels are each 6 ft in diameter, and 18 ft in circumference, one evolution covering 3 paces. According to ancient standards the pace was equal to 6 ft and 300 paces to a li; but now the li is reckoned as 360 paces of 5 ft each.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n</blockquote>\n\n[Note: the measurement of the Chinese-mile unit, the li, was changed over time, as the li in Song times differed from the length of a li in Han times.]\n\n<blockquote>\nThe vehicle wheel (li lun) is attached to the left road-wheel; it has a diameter of 1.38 ft with a circumference of 4.14 ft, and has 18 cogs (chhih) 2.3 inches apart. There is also a lower horizontal wheel (hsia phing lun), of diameter 4.14 ft and circumference 12.42 ft, with 54 cogs, the same distance apart as those on the vertical wheel (2.3 inches). (This engages with the former.){{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nUpon a vertical shaft turning with this wheel, there is fixed a bronze \"turning-like-the-wind wheel\" (hsuan feng lun) which has (only) 3 cogs, the distance between these being 1.2 inches. (This turns the following one.) In the middle is a horizontal wheel, 4 ft in diameter, and 12 ft circumference, with 100 cogs, the distance between these cogs being the same as on the \"turning-like-the-wind wheel\" (1.2 inches).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=284}}\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nNext, there is fixed (on the same shaft) a small horizontal wheel (hsiao phing lun) 3.3 inches in diameter and 1 ft in circumference, having 10 cogs 1.5 inches apart. (Engaging with this) there is an upper horizontal wheel (shang phing lun) having a diameter of 3.3 ft and a circumference of 10 ft, with 100 cogs, the same distance apart as those of the small horizontal wheel (1.5 inches).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=284}}\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen the middle horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 1 li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 10 li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is 8 inches in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the \"dog-teeth\" mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point (ti hsiang kou so, chhuan ya hsiang chih, chou erh fu shih).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=284}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Subsequent developments ===\n[[File:Hubodometer on a wheel of a semitrailer.jpg|thumb|A [[Hubodometer]] on a wheel of a semitrailer]]\n[[File:Smiths speedo.jpg|thumb|right|A Smiths speedometer from the 1920s showing odometer and trip meter.]]\nOdometers were first developed in the 1600s for wagons and other horse-drawn vehicles in order to measure distances traveled.\n\n[[Levinus Hulsius]] published the odometer in 1604 in his work ''Gr\u00fcndtliche Beschreibung de\u00df Diensthafften und Nutzbahrn Instruments Viatorii oder Wegz\u00e4hlers, So zu Fu\u00df, zu Pferdt unnd zu Fu\u00dfen gebraucht werden kann, damit mit geringer m\u00fche zu wissen, wie weit man gegangen, geritten, oder gefahren sey: als auch zu erfahren, ohne messen oder zehlen, wie weit von einem Orth zum andern.

Though not an odometer, the ''pascaline'' utilized gears to compute measurements.  Each gear contained 10 teeth.  The first gear advanced the next gear one position when moved one complete revolution, the same principle employed on modern mechanical odometers.\n\nOdometers were developed for ships in 1698 with the odometer invented by the Englishman [[Thomas Savery]].  [[Benjamin Franklin]], U.S. statesman and the first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], built a prototype odometer in 1775 that he attached to his carriage to help measure the [[Distance|mileage]] of postal routes.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-10 | archive-date=2015-08-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829041636/http://learn.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html | url=http://learn.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html | title=Benjamin Franklin and His Inventions | url-status=dead | website=learn.fi.edu}}</ref>  In 1847, [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]], a Mormon pioneer, invented the ''Roadometer'', which he attached to a wagon used by American settlers heading west.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-10 | url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-odometers-4074178 | title=The History of the Odometer | date=2019-04-06 | last=Bellis | first=Mary | language=en | url-status=live | website=ThoughtCo}}</ref>  The ''Roadometer'' recorded the distance traveled each day by the [[wagon trains]].

Warner, two brothers from Beloit, Wisconsin, introduced their patented ''Auto-meter''.  The ''Auto-Meter'' used a magnet attached to a rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal disk.  Measuring this pull provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument.  The Warners sold their company in 1912 to the Stewart & Clark Company of Chicago.  The new firm was renamed the Stewart-Warner Corporation. By 1925, Stewart-Warner odometers and trip meters were standard equipment on the vast majority of automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States.\n\nBy the early 2000s, mechanical odometers would be phased out on cars from major manufacturers. The [[Pontiac Grand Prix#Sixth generation (1997\u20132003)|Pontiac Grand Prix]] was the last GM car sold in the US to offer a mechanical odometer in 2003, the Canadian-built [[Ford Crown Victoria#Second generation (1998\u20132012)|Ford Crown Victoria]] and [[Mercury Grand Marquis#Fourth generation (2003\u20132011)|Mercury Grand Marquis]] were the very last Fords sold with one in 2005. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Trip meters ==\n[[File:Odometer rollover.jpg|thumb|right|After reaching the maximum reading, an odometer or trip meter restarts from zero, called odometer rollover.

Unlike the odometer, a trip meter is reset at any point in a journey, making it possible to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey. It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but, in most modern vehicles, it is now electronic. Luxury vehicles often have multiple trip meters. Most trip meters will show a maximum value of 999.9. The trip meter may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel, making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle; another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions, to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn.\n\n== Clocking/busting miles and legality ==\n{{Main|Odometer fraud}}\nA form of [[fraud]] is to tamper with the reading on an odometer and presenting the incorrect number of miles/kilometres raveled to a prospective buyer; this is often referred to as \"'''clocking'''\" in the UK and \"'''busting miles'''\" in the US.

With mechanical odometers, the [[speedometer]] can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a concept which provides the premise for a classic scene in the comedy film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle.\n\nThe resale value of a vehicle is often strongly influenced by the total distance shown on the odometer, yet odometers are inherently insecure because they are under the control of their owners. Many jurisdictions have chosen to enact laws which penalize people who are found to commit [[odometer fraud]]. In the US (and many other countries), vehicle mechanics are also required to keep records of the odometer any time a vehicle is serviced. Companies such as [[Carfax (company)|Carfax]] then use these data to help potential car buyers detect whether odometer rollback has occurred.\n\n=== Prevalence ===\nResearch by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] vehicle check specialist [[Cartell]] found that 20% of vehicles imported to Ireland from [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]] had had their mileometers altered to show a lower mileage.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-10 | url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/select_committee_on_transport/2010-06-16/2 | title=Road Traffic Bill 2009: Committee Stage (Resumed) | date=2010-06-16 | website=Houses of the Oireachtas website}}</ref>\n\n== Accuracy ==\nMost odometers work by counting wheel rotations and assume that the distance traveled is the number of wheel rotations times the tire circumference, which is a standard tire diameter times [[pi]] (3.1416).  If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer.  The formula is (actual distance traveled) = ( (final odometer reading) \u2013 (initial odometer reading) ) * (actual tire diameter) / (standard tire diameter).

Early forms of the odometer existed in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] as well as in [[ancient China]].

Both authors list the distances of routes traveled by [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336-323 BC) as by his [[bematist]]s Diognetus and Baeton. However, the high accuracy of the bematists's measurements rather indicates the use of a mechanical device. For example, the section between the cities Hecatompylos and Alexandria Areion, which later became a part of the [[silk road]], was given by Alexander's bematists as 529 [[Mile|English miles]] long, that is with a deviation of 0.2% from the actual distance (531 English miles). From the nine surviving bematists' measurements in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' eight show a deviation of less than 5% from the actual distance, three of them being within 1%. Since these minor discrepancies can be adequately explained by slight changes in the tracks of roads during the last 2300 years, the overall accuracy of the measurements implies that the bematists already must have used a sophisticated device for measuring distances, although there is no direct mention of such a device.\n\nAn odometer for measuring distance was first described by [[Vitruvius]] around 27 and 23 BC, although the actual inventor may have been [[Archimedes of Syracuse]] (c. 287 BC \u2013 c. 212 BC) during the [[First Punic War]]. [[Hero of Alexandria]] (10 AD \u2013 70 AD) describes a similar device in chapter 34 of his ''[[Dioptra]]''. The machine was also used in the time of Roman Emperor [[Commodus]] (c. 192 AD), although after this point in time there seems to be a gap between its use in Roman times and that of the 15th century in Western Europe.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=285}}  Some researchers have speculated that the device might have included technology similar to that of the Greek [[Antikythera mechanism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated188\">{{cite journal | bibcode=1981SciAm.245d.188S | title=Vitruvius' Odometer | date=October 1981 | last=Sleeswyk | first=Andr\u00e9 Wegener | journal=[[Scientific American]] | volume=245 | issue=4 | pages=188\u2013200 | issn=0036-8733 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1081-188}}</ref>\n\nThe odometer of Vitruvius was based on chariot wheels of {{Cvt|4|ft}} diameter turning 400 times in one Roman [[mile]] (about 1400&nbsp;m).

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] later tried to build it himself according to the description, but failed.  However, in 1981 engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica, replacing the square-toothed gear designs of da Vinci with the triangular, pointed teeth found in the ''Antikythera mechanism''.  With this modification, the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly.<ref name=\"autogenerated188\" />\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n[[File:Han dynasty odometer cart.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Han Dynasty]] stone rubbing of a horse-drawn odometer cart.]]\n==== Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period ====\nThe odometer was also independently invented in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]],{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} possibly by the prolific inventor and early scientist [[Zhang Heng]] (78 AD \u2013 139 AD) of the [[Han Dynasty]]. By the 3rd century (during the [[Three Kingdoms]] Period), the Chinese had termed the device as the 'j\u00ec l\u012d g\u016d ch\u0113' (\u8a18\u91cc\u9f13\u8eca), or '[[li (unit)|li]]-recording drum carriage' (Note: the modern measurement of li = {{Cvt|1640|ft|order=flip}}).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=281}} Chinese texts of the 3rd century tell of the mechanical carriage's functions, and as one li is traversed, a mechanical-driven wooden figure strikes a drum, and when ten li is traversed, another wooden figure would strike a gong or a bell with its mechanical-operated arm.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=281}}\n\nDespite its association with Zhang Heng or even the later [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200\u2013265), there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered around the ''huang men'' court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) that would follow the musical procession of the royal 'drum-chariot'.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}} The historian [[Joseph Needham]] asserts that it is no surprise this social group would have been responsible for such a device, since there is already other evidence of their craftsmanship with mechanical toys to delight the emperor and the court. There is speculation that some time in the 1st century BC (during the Western Han Dynasty), the beating of drums and gongs were mechanically-driven by working automatically off the rotation of the road-wheels.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}} This might have actually been the design of one Loxia Hong (c. 110 BC), yet by 125 AD the mechanical odometer carriage in China was already known (depicted in a mural of the [[Xiaotang Mountain Han Shrine|Xiaotangshan Tomb]]).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n\nThe odometer was used also in subsequent periods of Chinese history. In the historical text of the ''[[Book of Jin|Jin Shu]]'' (635 AD), the oldest part of the compiled text, the book known as the ''Cui Bao'' (c. 300 AD), recorded the use of the odometer, providing description (attributing it to the Western Han era, from 202 BC\u20139 AD).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=282}} The passage in the ''Jin Shu'' expanded upon this, explaining that it took a similar form to the mechanical device of the [[south-pointing chariot]] invented by [[Ma Jun]] (200\u2013265, see also [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear). As recorded in the ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'' of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the odometer and south-pointing chariot were combined into one wheeled device by engineers of the 9th century, 11th century, and 12th century. The ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' (Master Sun's Mathematical Manual), dated from the 3rd century to 5th century, presented a mathematical problem for students involving the odometer. It involved a given distance between two cities, the small distance needed for one rotation of the carriage's wheel, and the posed question of how many rotations the wheels would have in all if the carriage was to travel between point A and B.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=282}}\n\n==== Song Dynasty ====\nThe historical text of the ''[[History of Song|Song Shi]]'' (1345 AD), recording the people and events of the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279), also mentioned the odometer used in that period. However, unlike written sources of earlier periods, it provided a much more thoroughly detailed description of the device that harkens back to its ancient form ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):\n\n<blockquote>\nThe odometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, handsomely adorned with carvings. At the completion of every li, the wooden figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum; at the completion of every ten li, the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell. The carriage-pole ends in a phoenix-head, and the carriage is drawn by four horses. The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yung-Hsi reign-period (987 AD) [[Emperor Taizong of Song|the emperor Thai Tsung]] increased it to 30. In the 5th year of the Thien-Sheng reign-period (1027 AD) the Chief Chamberlain Lu Tao-lung presented specifications for the construction of odometers as follows:{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears, along with a concluding description at the end of how the device ultimately functions:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe vehicle should have a single pole and two wheels. On the body are two storeys, each containing a carved wooden figure holding a drumstick. The road-wheels are each 6 ft in diameter, and 18 ft in circumference, one evolution covering 3 paces. According to ancient standards the pace was equal to 6 ft and 300 paces to a li; but now the li is reckoned as 360 paces of 5 ft each.{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n</blockquote>\n\n[Note: the measurement of the Chinese-mile unit, the li, was changed over time, as the li in Song times differed from the length of a li in Han times.]\n\n<blockquote>\nThe vehicle wheel (li lun) is attached to the left road-wheel; it has a diameter of 1.38 ft with a circumference of 4.14 ft, and has 18 cogs (chhih) 2.3 inches apart. There is also a lower horizontal wheel (hsia phing lun), of diameter 4.14 ft and circumference 12.42 ft, with 54 cogs, the same distance apart as those on the vertical wheel (2.3 inches). (This engages with the former.){{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=283}}\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nUpon a vertical shaft turning with this wheel, there is fixed a bronze \"turning-like-the-wind wheel\" (hsuan feng lun) which has (only) 3 cogs, the distance between these being 1.2 inches. (This turns the following one.) In the middle is a horizontal wheel, 4 ft in diameter, and 12 ft circumference, with 100 cogs, the distance between these cogs being the same as on the \"turning-like-the-wind wheel\" (1.2 inches).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=284}}\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nNext, there is fixed (on the same shaft) a small horizontal wheel (hsiao phing lun) 3.3 inches in diameter and 1 ft in circumference, having 10 cogs 1.5 inches apart. (Engaging with this) there is an upper horizontal wheel (shang phing lun) having a diameter of 3.3 ft and a circumference of 10 ft, with 100 cogs, the same distance apart as those of the small horizontal wheel (1.5 inches).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=284}}\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen the middle horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 1 li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 10 li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is 8 inches in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the \"dog-teeth\" mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point (ti hsiang kou so, chhuan ya hsiang chih, chou erh fu shih).{{sfn | Needham | 1965 | p=284}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Subsequent developments ===\n[[File:Hubodometer on a wheel of a semitrailer.jpg|thumb|A [[Hubodometer]] on a wheel of a semitrailer]]\n[[File:Smiths speedo.jpg|thumb|right|A Smiths speedometer from the 1920s showing odometer and trip meter.]]\nOdometers were first developed in the 1600s for wagons and other horse-drawn vehicles in order to measure distances traveled.\n\n[[Levinus Hulsius]] published the odometer in 1604 in his work ''Gr\u00fcndtliche Beschreibung de\u00df Diensthafften und Nutzbahrn Instruments Viatorii oder Wegz\u00e4hlers, So zu Fu\u00df, zu Pferdt unnd zu Fu\u00dfen gebraucht werden kann, damit mit geringer m\u00fche zu wissen, wie weit man gegangen, geritten, oder gefahren sey: als auch zu erfahren, ohne messen oder zehlen, wie weit von einem Orth zum andern. Daneben wird auch der grosse verborgene Wegweiser angezeiget und vermeldet''.{{sfn | Kern | 2010 | p=470}}\n\nIn 1645, the French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] invented the ''[[pascaline]]''. Though not an odometer, the ''pascaline'' utilized gears to compute measurements.  Each gear contained 10 teeth.  The first gear advanced the next gear one position when moved one complete revolution, the same principle employed on modern mechanical odometers.\n\nOdometers were developed for ships in 1698 with the odometer invented by the Englishman [[Thomas Savery]].  [[Benjamin Franklin]], U.S. statesman and the first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], built a prototype odometer in 1775 that he attached to his carriage to help measure the [[Distance|mileage]] of postal routes.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-10 | archive-date=2015-08-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829041636/http://learn.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html | url=http://learn.fi.edu/franklin/inventor/inventor.html | title=Benjamin Franklin and His Inventions | url-status=dead | website=learn.fi.edu}}</ref>  In 1847, [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]], a Mormon pioneer, invented the ''Roadometer'', which he attached to a wagon used by American settlers heading west.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-10 | url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-odometers-4074178 | title=The History of the Odometer | date=2019-04-06 | last=Bellis | first=Mary | language=en | url-status=live | website=ThoughtCo}}</ref>  The ''Roadometer'' recorded the distance traveled each day by the [[wagon trains]].

Warner, two brothers from Beloit, Wisconsin, introduced their patented ''Auto-meter''.  The ''Auto-Meter'' used a magnet attached to a rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal disk.  Measuring this pull provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument.  The Warners sold their company in 1912 to the Stewart & Clark Company of Chicago.  The new firm was renamed the Stewart-Warner Corporation. By 1925, Stewart-Warner odometers and trip meters were standard equipment on the vast majority of automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States.\n\nBy the early 2000s, mechanical odometers would be phased out on cars from major manufacturers. The [[Pontiac Grand Prix#Sixth generation (1997\u20132003)|Pontiac Grand Prix]] was the last GM car sold in the US to offer a mechanical odometer in 2003, the Canadian-built [[Ford Crown Victoria#Second generation (1998\u20132012)|Ford Crown Victoria]] and [[Mercury Grand Marquis#Fourth generation (2003\u20132011)|Mercury Grand Marquis]] were the very last Fords sold with one in 2005. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Trip meters ==\n[[File:Odometer rollover.jpg|thumb|right|After reaching the maximum reading, an odometer or trip meter restarts from zero, called odometer rollover.

Unlike the odometer, a trip meter is reset at any point in a journey, making it possible to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey. It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but, in most modern vehicles, it is now electronic. Luxury vehicles often have multiple trip meters. Most trip meters will show a maximum value of 999.9. The trip meter may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel, making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle; another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions, to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn.\n\n== Clocking/busting miles and legality ==\n{{Main|Odometer fraud}}\nA form of [[fraud]] is to tamper with the reading on an mileometer/odometer and presenting the incorrect number of miles/kilometers traveled to a prospective buyer; this is often referred to as \"'''clocking'''\" in the UK and \"'''busting miles'''\" in the US. This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been, and thus increase its apparent market value.

With mechanical odometers, the [[speedometer]] can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a property that provides the premise for a classic scene late in the comedy film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle.\n\nThe resale value of a vehicle is often strongly influenced by the total distance shown on the odometer, yet odometers are inherently insecure because they are under the control of their owners. Many jurisdictions have chosen to enact laws which penalize people who are found to commit [[odometer fraud]]. In the US (and many other countries), vehicle mechanics are also required to keep records of the odometer any time a vehicle is serviced. Companies such as [[Carfax (company)|Carfax]] then use these data to help potential car buyers detect whether odometer rollback has occurred.\n\n=== Prevalence ===\nResearch by [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] vehicle check specialist [[Cartell]] found that 20% of vehicles imported to Ireland from [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]] had had their mileometers altered to show a lower mileage.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-10 | url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/select_committee_on_transport/2010-06-16/2 | title=Road Traffic Bill 2009: Committee Stage (Resumed) | date=2010-06-16 | website=Houses of the Oireachtas website}}</ref>\n\n== Accuracy ==\nMost odometers work by counting wheel rotations and assume that the distance traveled is the number of wheel rotations times the tire circumference, which is a standard tire diameter times [[pi]] (3.1416).  If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer.  The formula is (actual distance traveled) = ( (final odometer reading) \u2013 (initial odometer reading) ) * (actual tire diameter) / (standard tire diameter).  It is common for odometers to be off by several percent.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-01-22 | url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-your-odometer-cheating-you/ | title=Is Your Odometer Cheating You? | language=en-US | website=www.cbsnews.com}}</ref>   Odometer errors are typically proportional to [[Speedometer#Error|speedometer errors]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Mechanical counter]]\n*[[Opisometer]]\n*[[Roadometer (odometer)]]\n*[[Speedometer]]\n*[[Surveyor's wheel]]\n*[[Tachograph]]\n*[[Tachometer]]\n*[[Taximeter]]\n*[[Chip log#More modern logs and replacements|Taffrail log]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite journal | bibcode=1981SciAm.245d.188S | title=Vitruvius' Odometer | date=October 1981 | last=Sleeswyk | first=Andr\u00e9 Wegener | journal=[[Scientific American]] | volume=245 | issue=4 | pages=188\u2013200 | issn=0036-8733 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1081-188}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv| title=Vitruvius' Waywiser | date=1979 | last=Sleeswyk | first=Andr\u00e9 Wegener | journal=Archives Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences | volume=29 | issue=104 | pages=11\u201322}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Engels|first=Donald W.|title=Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy1go8_kAegC&pg=PA157|year=1978|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03433-4}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGyrCfYs2AC|series=[[Science and Civilisation in China]]|volume=4|year=1965|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kern|first=Ralf|title=Vom Compendium zum Einzelinstrument. 17.

He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Philanthropy & Charity==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary.

Powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] turbojet engines then [[Garrett TFE731]]s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.\n\nDesigned in 1957 to compete with the JetStar, the [[McDonnell 119]] was delayed by the cancellation of the [[Fairchild J83]] engine program, and first flew on 11 February 1959 powered by four [[Westinghouse J34]] turbojets. The 119 was certified for a {{convert|45328|lb|t|1}} MTOW with four Pratt & Whitney JT12 or General Electric CF700 engines, but no firm orders were received, and only the single prototype was completed.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Francillon |first=Ren\u00e9 |date=1990 |title=McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Since 1920 |volume=II  |location=Annapolis, Maryland |publisher=Naval Institute Press |pages=241\u2013243 |isbn=1-55750-550-0 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1960s first flight ===\n[[File:Air Zoo Learjet II.JPG|thumb|The 1963 [[Learjet 23]] was the first light jet.]]\n[[File:Grumman G-1159 Gulfstream II-SP AN0489926.jpg|thumb|The first large, long range jet was the [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe {{convert|25000|lb|t}} MTOW [[British Aerospace 125]] first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two {{convert|3000|lbf|kN}}  [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] turbojets.

Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft; and it was developed as the [[IAI Astra]], later re-branded as the [[Gulfstream G100]].\n\nThe {{convert|29,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Dassault Falcon 20]] first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CF700]]s, then [[Garrett ATF3]] turbofans and [[Garrett TFE731]]s. A total of 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the [[Dassault Falcon]] family.\n\nThe first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 : the [[Learjet 23]]. Powered by two {{convert|2,850|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CJ610]]s, its {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} MTOW complies with [[FAR Part 23]] regulations. The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MOTW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

First of all, their reduced squad meant that they omitted Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez. According to [[Luis Guevara Mora]], the 20-year-old goalkeeper, the [[Salvadoran Football Federation]] decided to take members of the Federation, as well as their friends and family, and spent so much money they could not afford to bring a full squad.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The team took many stops throughout Europe under the direction of the Federation, taking three days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so. Once they arrived, there was more trouble. [[Adidas]] sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team needed to train with. The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems.

The national team's first match was played in September 1921, when they were invited to participate in [[Independence Centenary Games|a tournament]] to celebrate 100 years of [[Central American declarations of independence|Central American Independence]].\n\nEl Salvador has made two [[FIFA World Cup]] appearances: first in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and again in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], but have never progressed beyond the first stage of a finals tournament.

El Salvador took part for the first time alongside Costa Rica, [[Cura\u00e7ao national football team|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], and Panama. El Salvador were runners-up, recording two wins, one tie, and one loss.<ref name=\"CCCF 1941\"/>\n\nThe [[1943 CCCF Championship]] took place in San Salvador with the participation of Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. El Salvador was coached by former national player [[Am\u00e9rico Gonz\u00e1lez (footballer)|Am\u00e9rico Gonz\u00e1lez]]. At the end of the tournament, El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker. On December 21, Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference. This was the country's first international title. El Salvador's 10\u20121 set the team's record for the most goals scored in a single game yet . It was also the second time a Salvadoran player (Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz) had scored five goals in a single match.<ref name=\"CCCF 1943\"/> El Salvador defended their title in the [[1946 CCCF Championship]], hosted in [[Costa Rica]], alongside six other participants. ''La Selecta'' finished in third place, winning three matches and losing two.

Reasons for these refusals are unknown but might be due to the cost of travel, since at that time the team had never played so far from home.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During these years El Salvador had a good squad, with players like goalkeeper Manuel \"Tamal\u00f3n\" Garay, Rafael \"Chapuda\" Reyes, Conrado Miranda, Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz, Rafael Corado and Mando Rivas.\n\nIn the group stage of the [[Football at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games|1950 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in Mexico, El Salvador recorded two wins, one tie, and one loss.

This marked the sixth time El Salvador participated in the CCCF Championship. For unknown reasons they didn't participate in the [[1957 CCCF Championship|1957]] and [[1960 CCCF Championship|1960]] CCCF Championships.\n\n===1960s===\nEl Salvador returned to participate in the [[1961 CCCF Championship]], hosted in Costa Rica, alongside nine other national teams. Due to the larger number of teams the CCCF Championship shifted to a two-round format with two [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stages. In the first round, there were two groups, one with five teams and one with four. The top two teams from both groups advanced to the second stage. El Salvador was placed in the four team group [[Honduras]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[Nicaragua]], which they topped with two wins and one draw. In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica, who won their seventh CCCF Championship. Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the [[CONCACAF Championship]].\n\n[[1963 CONCACAF Championship|The first CONCACAF Championship was hosted in 1963]] and El Salvador hosted both the qualification round and final tournament.

The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake.

The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek.

Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.

A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.\n|}\n\n===Matrix mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\"/>) \n{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}\nIn matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|\u00c2}} and {{mvar|B\u0302}},  one defines their commutator as\n:<math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=\\hat{A}\\hat{B}-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}.</math>\nIn the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]=i \\hbar.</math>\n\nThe physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}. By definition, this means that <math>\\hat{x}|\\psi\\rangle = x_0 |\\psi\\rangle.</math> Applying the commutator to <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> yields\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x}\\hat{p}-\\hat{p}\\hat{x}) | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u00ce}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].\n\nSuppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''<sub>0</sub>}}. If this were true, then  one could write\n:<math>(\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (x_0 \\hat{I} - x_0 \\hat{I})  p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle=0.</math>\nOn the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle=i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle \\ne 0.</math>\nThis implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.\n\nWhen a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  \n:<math>\\sigma_x=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{x}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{x}\\rangle^2}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma_p=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{p}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{p}\\rangle^2}.</math>\n\nAs in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.\n\n==Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger uncertainty relations==\nThe most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.<ref name=\"Robertson1929\">{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The definition of <math>\\hat{A}</math> depends on our choice to have <math>\\theta</math> range from 0 to <math>2\\pi</math>. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, <math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=i\\hbar</math>.<ref>More precisely, <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi=i\\hbar\\psi</math> whenever both <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi</math> and <math>\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi</math> are defined, and the space of such <math>\\psi</math> is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space.

These states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Also the operator <math>\\hat{A}</math> is bounded, since <math>\\theta</math> ranges over a bounded interval. Thus, in the state <math>\\psi</math>, the uncertainty of <math>B</math> is zero and the uncertainty of <math>A</math> is finite, so that \n:<math>\\sigma_A\\sigma_B=0.</math>\nAlthough this result appears to violate the Robertson uncertainty principle, the paradox is resolved when we note that <math>\\psi</math> is not in the domain of the operator <math>\\hat{B}\\hat{A}</math>, since multiplication by <math>\\theta</math> disrupts the periodic boundary conditions imposed on <math>\\hat{B}</math>.<ref name=\"Hall2013\"/> Thus, the derivation of the Robertson relation, which requires <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi</math> and <math>\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi</math> to be defined, does not apply.

In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time\u2013frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.\n\nAs a result, in order to analyze signals where the transients are important, the [[Wavelet Transform|wavelet transform]] is often used instead of the Fourier.\n\n===DFT-Uncertainty principle===\nThere is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).<ref name=\"Donoho\">{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906\u2013931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{ x_n } \\right \\} := x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{N-1}</math> be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{X_k} \\right \\} := X_0, X_1, \\ldots, X_{N-1},</math> its [[discrete Fourier transform]].\n\nDenote by <math>\\|x\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the time sequence <math>x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{N-1}</math> and by <math>\\|X\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the frequency sequence <math>X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{N-1}</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron.

If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.\n\nThe combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W.

According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory.

Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.\n\nIn 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',<ref name=\"Popper1934\">{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807\u2013808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}</ref> and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:\n<blockquote>[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''.
