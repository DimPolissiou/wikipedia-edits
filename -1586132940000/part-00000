Before this occupation, a local rebellion had been organized against invasion of the Ottomans by Hadji, known as \u201cKasab\u201d (butcher) and Bayandar when they came to know that [[Saffavids]] were to launch an attack. They were backed by the local people. The rebels initially took control of the city and also occupied a fortress near the city. However, the rebels had their own internal dissensions, and as a result a small battalion of the Ottoman army defeated the rebels and killed them. Following this victory and occupation by the Ottomans, Khaten bey Ordubadi, the prime [[vizier]], appealed to the Shah to waive off all taxes levied on the local people, which was agreed.{{Sfn|Zardabli|2014|p=318}}\n\nOrdubad was once an important regional stop on the caravan route of the [[Silk Road]] trade with China, Europe and India. The city was first founded as Gala city, a feudal city,  on the top of the Ambras on the left bank of [[Ordubadchay River]] in the 15th century. In view of extensive trade, the city started developing on the right bank of the Ordubadchay with many new districts. In the 17th and 18th centuries trade centres were established in the city on the right bank, which diminished the importance of Gala city. Built in the backdrop of [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur Caucasus mountain]] it is enclosed on three sides by mountains providing for a very green environment. In the 17th century the city underwent major reconstruction activity, maintaining eastern feudal architectural features.<ref name=Heritage/> Following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]], the town passed from [[Qajar dynasty|Iranian]] rule to [[Imperial Russia]]n rule under the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828.

Before this occupation, a local rebellion had been organized against invasion of the Ottomans by Hadji, known as \u201cKasab\u201d (butcher) and Bayandar when they came to know that [[Saffavids]] were to launch an attack. They were backed by the local people. The rebels initially took control of the city and also occupied a fortress near the city. However, the rebels had their own internal dissensions, and as a result a small battalion of the Ottoman army defeated the rebels and killed them. Following this victory and occupation by the Ottomans, Khaten bey Ordubadi, the prime [[vizier]], appealed to the Shah to waive off all taxes levied on the local people, which was agreed.{{Sfn|Zardabli|2014|p=318}}\n\nOrdubad was once an important regional stop on the caravan route of the [[Silk Road]] trade with China, Europe and India. The city was first founded as Gala city, a feudal city,  on the top of the Ambras on the left bank of [[Ordubadchay River]] in the 15th century. In view of extensive trade, the city started developing on the right bank of the Ordubadchay with many new districts. In the 17th and 18th centuries trade centres were established in the city on the right bank, which diminished the importance of Gala city. Built in the backdrop of [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur Caucasus mountain]] it is enclosed on three sides by mountains providing for a very green environment. In the 17th century the city underwent major reconstruction activity, maintaining eastern feudal architectural features.<ref name=Heritage/> Following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]], the town passed from [[Qajar dynasty|Iranian]] rule to [[Imperial Russia]]n rule under the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828.

Pottery typologies and seriations and a host of [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS]] [[radiocarbon]] dates show that the site had a number of occupations over several millennia from circa 3500 BC - AD 500 (DAUM 2001a, 2001b; GARI 2002).\n\nThis site is very important in Korean and world prehistory because of the many important finds including one of the earliest ditch-enclosed settlements in East Asia, substantial prehistoric dry-fields, a multiple ditch-enclosed residential and production precinct for emerging elites,  and the earliest evidence of craft specialization (greenstone or '[[jade]]' ornaments) in prehistoric Korea, well-preserved evidence of other production activities including pottery-making. Several small-scale excavations took place beginning in 1977. Wide-scope, large-scale excavation of Daepyeong and surrounding settlements took place between 1996 and 2000.\n\n==Environment and geography of Daepyeong==\nPrehistoric Daepyeong incorporates in area formed by the curves of the [[Gyeongho River|Nam River]] in a single area of several small, linked alluvial plains that are semi-circumscribed by steep hills of 100\u20131100 metres. In the north, Daepyeong includes Sonam-ni and Eoeun, and in the south Okbang and Sangchon-ni are included. Eoeun and Okbang make up the central area and are partially protected by a natural levee formed by terracing and changes in the flow of the Nam River.\n\n==Jeulmun Pottery Period (c. 3500-1500 B.C.)==\nJeulmun pottery sherds are found in light numbers throughout the area, indicating that occupation began at least from the Middle [[Jeulmun Pottery Period]]. A settlement with a number of pit-houses dating to the latter part of the Middle Jeulmun was excavated at Sangchon-ni (DAUM 2001b). At the same site charred human skeletal remains were discovered in the corner of a pit-house inside a large vessel apparently used as a burial urn. Additionally, there is evidence of a shallow ditch feature that may represent one of the first ditch-enclosed features in East Asian prehistory. Some carbonized seeds found in association with the pit-houses appear to show that Jeulmun people were engaged in small-scale cultivation (Bale 2001; Crawford and Lee 2003).\n\n==Early Mumun Pottery Period (c. 1500-850 B.C.)==\n[[Image:Mumunsitesmap.png|thumb|left|200px|The Daepyeong site and other settlement sites of the [[Mumun]] Period that are mentioned in Wikipedia articles.]]\nSettlement in the Incipient and Early [[Mumun Pottery Period]] I was sparse and concentrated in Eoeun (NRICH 2004:141-142). The same area was the location for a settlement of narrow rectangular pit-houses with plans that are not unlike those of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquoian]] [[longhouse]]s of Southern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. For example, these pit-houses had a series of 2 - 4 hearths lined down the middle of the structure, indicating that the occupants were likely members of an extended, multi-generational household (Bale and Ko 2006). Several small hamlets and/or farmsteads were dispersed in and around the main Daepyeong settlement at Eoeun in areas such as Sonam-ni, Okbang, and Sangchon-ni.\n\n==Middle Mumun Pottery Period (c. 850-550 B.C.)==\nDaepyeong became a large central settlement in the Early Middle Mumun (c. 850-700 BC). The focus of the settlement was a large nucleated group of 144 pit-houses in Eoeun. Another nucleated settlement of 115 [[pit-house]]s developed in Okbang at about the same time. Archaeological evidence from the Middle Mumun indicates that prominent individuals in Eoeun and Okbang probably competed for dominance in the local area. For example, greenstone production and distribution began in Eoeun and was traded to Okbang and areas outside of Daepyeong. Many ditches and ditch-enclosures appeared in Eoeun and Okbang beginning in the Early Middle Mumun. Perhaps this was due to conflict between Okbang and Eoeun, or the whole of Daepyeong with distant outside settlements. Eventually, 8 substantial ditch-and-palisades were constructed at Okbang. This sub-period sees a pattern in which greenstone artifacts that are made in Eoeun are consumed by those who are buried in the ditch-and-palisade precinct of Okbang.\n\nArchaeologists think that the dry-fields recovered in large-scale excavations most likely date to the Early Middle Mumun. Bale and Ko note that more than 32,000 square metres of dry-fields were recovered at Daepyeong in wide-scope, clearing horizontal excavations (Bale and Ko 2006:Table 3). Through detailed and long-term archaeobotanical research, Crawford and Lee of the [[University of Toronto]], [[Canada]] discovered the people of Daepyeong had multiple cropping agricultural systems in place even in the Early Mumun (Crawford and Lee 2003).\n\n==Late Mumun, Protohistoric, and Korean Three Kingdoms (c. 550 BC - AD 668)==\nDaepyeong was an important settlement in the Mumun economic system, but as with many simple chiefdoms, it began to decline and then collapsed. The area was likely depopulated at the end of the Late Middle Mumun, circa 550-500 BC. Sangchon-ni may have had an ephemeral Late Mumun occupation, and settlements such as Naechon-ni (DAUM 2001a) appeared in the Korean Proto-historic (c. 300 BC - AD 300/400). Additionally, dry-fields dating to the early [[Korean Three Kingdoms]] period have been excavated in Okbang. The area was a part of the [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]] Confederacy during this period, and was later absorbed into the [[Silla]] state.\n\n==Importance==\nDaepyeong, a large, complex, and economically important settlement with multiple chronological components, is important for those trying to understand the secondary origins of agriculture in [[East Asia]], the development of complex hunter-gatherers, nucleated settlements, intensive agriculture, incipient social ranking, and simple chiefdoms. This site is on the same scale of archaeological importance as [[Yoshinogari site|Yoshinogari]] and [[Sannai-Maruyama site|Sannai-Maruyama]] in Japan, and [[Banpo]] and [[Jiangzhai, Xi'an|Jiangzhai]] of the Early Chinese Neolithic.\n\n==References==\n<small>\n*Bale, Martin T.\n:2001   Archaeology of Early Agriculture in Korea: An Update on Recent Developments.

Pottery typologies and seriations and a host of [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS]] [[radiocarbon]] dates show that the site had a number of occupations over several millennia from circa 3500 BC - AD 500 (DAUM 2001a, 2001b; GARI 2002).\n\nThis site is very important in Korean and world prehistory because of the many important finds including one of the earliest ditch-enclosed settlements in East Asia, substantial prehistoric dry-fields, a multiple ditch-enclosed residential and production precinct for emerging elites,  and the earliest evidence of craft specialization (greenstone or '[[jade]]' ornaments) in prehistoric Korea, well-preserved evidence of other production activities including pottery-making. Several small-scale excavations took place beginning in 1977. Wide-scope, large-scale excavation of Daepyeong and surrounding settlements took place between 1996 and 2000.\n\n==Environment and geography of Daepyeong==\nPrehistoric Daepyeong incorporates in area formed by the curves of the [[Gyeongho River|Nam River]] in a single area of several small, linked alluvial plains that are semi-circumscribed by steep hills of 100\u20131100 metres. In the north, Daepyeong includes Sonam-ni and Eoeun, and in the south Okbang and Sangchon-ni are included. Eoeun and Okbang make up the central area and are partially protected by a natural levee formed by terracing and changes in the flow of the Nam River.\n\n==Jeulmun Pottery Period (c. 3500-1500 B.C.)==\nJeulmun pottery sherds are found in light numbers throughout the area, indicating that occupation began at least from the Middle [[Jeulmun Pottery Period]]. A settlement with a number of pit-houses dating to the latter part of the Middle Jeulmun was excavated at Sangchon-ni (DAUM 2001b). At the same site charred human skeletal remains were discovered in the corner of a pit-house inside a large vessel apparently used as a burial urn. Additionally, there is evidence of a shallow ditch feature that may represent one of the first ditch-enclosed features in East Asian prehistory. Some carbonized seeds found in association with the pit-houses appear to show that Jeulmun people were engaged in small-scale cultivation (Bale 2001; Crawford and Lee 2003).\n\n==Early Mumun Pottery Period (c. 1500-850 B.C.)==\n[[Image:Mumunsitesmap.png|thumb|left|200px|The Daepyeong site and other settlement sites of the [[Mumun]] Period that are mentioned in Wikipedia articles.]]\nSettlement in the Incipient and Early [[Mumun Pottery Period]] I was sparse and concentrated in Eoeun (NRICH 2004:141-142). The same area was the location for a settlement of narrow rectangular pit-houses with plans that are not unlike those of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquoian]] [[longhouse]]s of Southern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. For example, these pit-houses had a series of 2 - 4 hearths lined down the middle of the structure, indicating that the occupants were likely members of an extended, multi-generational household (Bale and Ko 2006). Several small hamlets and/or farmsteads were dispersed in and around the main Daepyeong settlement at Eoeun in areas such as Sonam-ni, Okbang, and Sangchon-ni.\n\n==Middle Mumun Pottery Period (c. 850-550 B.C.)==\nDaepyeong became a large central settlement in the Early Middle Mumun (c. 850-700 BC). The focus of the settlement was a large nucleated group of 144 pit-houses in Eoeun. Another nucleated settlement of 115 [[pit-house]]s developed in Okbang at about the same time. Archaeological evidence from the Middle Mumun indicates that prominent individuals in Eoeun and Okbang probably competed for dominance in the local area. For example, greenstone production and distribution began in Eoeun and was traded to Okbang and areas outside of Daepyeong. Many ditches and ditch-enclosures appeared in Eoeun and Okbang beginning in the Early Middle Mumun. Perhaps this was due to conflict between Okbang and Eoeun, or the whole of Daepyeong with distant outside settlements. Eventually, 8 substantial ditch-and-palisades were constructed at Okbang. This sub-period sees a pattern in which greenstone artifacts that are made in Eoeun are consumed by those who are buried in the ditch-and-palisade precinct of Okbang.\n\nArchaeologists think that the dry-fields recovered in large-scale excavations most likely date to the Early Middle Mumun. Bale and Ko note that more than 32,000 square metres of dry-fields were recovered at Daepyeong in wide-scope, clearing horizontal excavations (Bale and Ko 2006:Table 3). Through detailed and long-term archaeobotanical research, Crawford and Lee of the [[University of Toronto]], [[Canada]] discovered the people of Daepyeong had multiple cropping agricultural systems in place even in the Early Mumun (Crawford and Lee 2003).\n\n==Late Mumun, Protohistoric, and Korean Three Kingdoms (c. 550 BC - AD 668)==\nDaepyeong was an important settlement in the Mumun economic system, but as with many simple chiefdoms, it began to decline and then collapsed. The area was likely depopulated at the end of the Late Middle Mumun, circa 550-500 BC. Sangchon-ni may have had an ephemeral Late Mumun occupation, and settlements such as Naechon-ni (DAUM 2001a) appeared in the Korean Proto-historic (c. 300 BC - AD 300/400). Additionally, dry-fields dating to the early [[Korean Three Kingdoms]] period have been excavated in Okbang. The area was a part of the [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]] Confederacy during this period, and was later absorbed into the [[Silla]] state.\n\n==Importance==\nDaepyeong, a large, complex, and economically important settlement with multiple chronological components, is important for those trying to understand the secondary origins of agriculture in [[East Asia]], the development of complex hunter-gatherers, nucleated settlements, intensive agriculture, incipient social ranking, and simple chiefdoms. This site is on the same scale of archaeological importance as [[Yoshinogari site|Yoshinogari]] and [[Sannai-Maruyama site|Sannai-Maruyama]] in Japan, and [[Banpo]] and [[Jiangzhai, Xi'an|Jiangzhai]] of the Early Chinese Neolithic.\n\n==References==\n<small>\n*Bale, Martin T.\n:2001   Archaeology of Early Agriculture in Korea: An Update on Recent Developments.

These were produced by the Society under the direction of [[Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet|Sir John Lubbock]], and won admiring praise both for their excellence of execution, and for their availability at a moderate price, supporting the Society's aims of dissemination.<ref>''Six Maps of the Stars'' (S.D.U.K., London 1830): reviewed in 'XXXVIII: Notices respecting new books', R.

Although they were not fully original surveys, he often travelled to verify points in question, and illustrated them with architectural views and cameos which were usually arranged along the foot of each sheet.<ref>M.T. Cain, 'The Maps of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge: A Publishing History', ''Imago Mundi'' Vol. 46 (1994), pp. 151-167.</ref>\n\nClarke's ''Plan of Ancient Rome'', with architectural views, was engraved by J. and C. Walker and published under the superintendence of the Society in 1830, and had a companion ''Plan of Modern Rome''. Under the same auspices his plan of [[Warsaw]] (engraved by T.E. Nicholson) is dated 1831, his [[Milano]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] 1832, his [[Berlin]], and his [[Torino]], with three views, 1833 (both engraved by J.

His [[London]], [[Firenze]], [[Genova]], [[Venezia]] and [[Amsterdam]] (engraved by Benjamin Rees Davies, 1789-1872) are dated 1835, his [[Moscow]] 1836, and his [[Napoli]], with architectural view (engraved by T.

Clarke's plans and maps, of which he produced many, are still admired and collected.\n\nTo 1836 belongs the modest ''Guide to Hayling'' (1836), an account of [[Hayling Island]] in Hampshire as an early tourist resort, which is \"embellished with wood engravings from sketches by W.B. Clarke, architect\" (engraved by J. Jackson). It is not clear that Clarke was responsible for anything more than the sketches, though the view of the \"Billiard-room, Cosmorama and Reading-room\" (facing p.&nbsp;32) is like the architectural elevations on his city plans.<ref>''The Guide to Hayling; Embellished with wood-engravings, from sketches by W.B.

That his travels now took him to Italy is suggested by a paper by W.B. Clarke ''On the [[Arch of Augustus (Rimini)|Arch of Augustus]] at [[Rimini]] and the [[Arch of Augustus (Fano)|Gate of Augustus]] at [[Fano]]'' (an architectural study suggesting different phases of construction), which appeared in 1841 in the Journal of the Rome Corresponding Archaeological Institute.<ref>W.B.

Cain, 'The Maps of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge: A Publishing History', ''Imago Mundi'' Vol. 46 (1994), pp. 151-167.</ref>\n\nClarke's ''Plan of Ancient Rome'', with architectural views, was engraved by J. and C. Walker and published under the superintendence of the Society in 1830, and had a companion ''Plan of Modern Rome''. Under the same auspices his plan of [[Warsaw]] (engraved by T.E. Nicholson) is dated 1831, his [[Milano]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] 1832, his [[Berlin]], and his [[Torino]], with three views, 1833 (both engraved by J. Henshall); his [[Paris]] and [[St Petersburg]] are of 1834. His [[London]], [[Firenze]], [[Genova]], [[Venezia]] and [[Amsterdam]] (engraved by Benjamin Rees Davies, 1789-1872) are dated 1835, his [[Moscow]] 1836, and his [[Napoli]], with architectural view (engraved by T. Bradley) is of 1838.<ref>'Drawn by W.B. Clarke, Archt.' (SDUK/Baldwin & Craddock, London, 1830-1838). Republished in the 1840s.</ref> His Scandinavian efforts include [[Copenhagen]], with a panorama (J. Henshall), dated 1837, and [[Stockholm]] (1838). Clarke's plans and maps, of which he produced many, are still admired and collected.\n\nTo 1836 belongs the modest ''Guide to Hayling'' (1836), an account of [[Hayling Island]] in Hampshire as an early tourist resort, which is \"embellished with wood engravings from sketches by W.B. Clarke, architect\" (engraved by J. Jackson). It is not clear that Clarke was responsible for anything more than the sketches, though the view of the \"Billiard-room, Cosmorama and Reading-room\" (facing p.&nbsp;32) is like the architectural elevations on his city plans.<ref>''The Guide to Hayling; Embellished with wood-engravings, from sketches by W.B.

That his travels now took him to Italy is suggested by a paper by W.B. Clarke ''On the [[Arch of Augustus (Rimini)|Arch of Augustus]] at [[Rimini]] and the [[Arch of Augustus (Fano)|Gate of Augustus]] at [[Fano]]'' (an architectural study suggesting different phases of construction), which appeared in 1841 in the Journal of the Rome Corresponding Archaeological Institute.<ref>W.B.
