An often used example is \"putting a gun to someone's head\" (''at gunpoint'') or putting a \"knife under the throat\" (''at knifepoint'' or cut-throat) to compel action or the victim gets killed or injured. These are so common that they are also used as metaphors for other forms of coercion.\n\nArmed forces in many countries use [[firing squad]]s to maintain [[discipline]] and intimidate the masses, or opposition, into submission or silent [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as \"the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would.\"<ref>Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5\u201338.</ref> Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.\n\n===Psychological===\n[[File:Jimbo Wales 2005.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Scholars have noted that [[Wikipedia]] co-founder [[Jimbo Wales]] often uses coercion with his editors. Psychological threats and [[culpability]] are commonplace on the online encyclopedia, and Wales has promoted a [[climate of fear]].]]\nIn [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. \"[[emotional blackmail]]\", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].\n\nPsychological coercion \u2013 along with the other varieties \u2013 was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the \"[[Thought reform in China|Thought Reform]]\" campaign of 1951\u20131952. The process \u2013 carried out partly at \"revolutionary universities\" and partly within prisons \u2013 was investigated and reported by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological \"confessions\". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin \u2013 who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject \u2013 was induced to write: \"The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth\" [Lifton (1961) p.&nbsp;545].\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abusive power and control]]\n* [[Coercive control]]\n* [[Coercive power]]\n* [[Deterrence (legal)]]\n* [[Duress in American law]]\n* [[Duress in English law]]\n* [[Marital coercion]]\n* [[Monopoly on violence]]\n* [[Punishment (psychology)]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Scott A. | date=n.d. | title=Towards a Better Theory of Coercion, and a Use for It | publisher=The University of Chicago | url=http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | accessdate=12 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308180431/http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | archive-date=8 March 2005 }}\n* Lifton, Robert J.

Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as \"the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would.\"<ref>Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5\u201338.</ref> Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.\n\n===Psychological===\nIn [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. \"[[emotional blackmail]]\", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].\n\nPsychological coercion \u2013 along with the other varieties \u2013 was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the \"[[Thought reform in China|Thought Reform]]\" campaign of 1951\u20131952. The process \u2013 carried out partly at \"revolutionary universities\" and partly within prisons \u2013 was investigated and reported upon by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological \"confessions\". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin \u2013 who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject \u2013 was induced to write: \"The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth\" [Lifton (1961) p.&nbsp;545].\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abusive power and control]]\n* [[Coercive control]]\n* [[Coercive power]]\n* [[Deterrence (legal)]]\n* [[Duress in American law]]\n* [[Duress in English law]]\n* [[Marital coercion]]\n* [[Monopoly on violence]]\n* [[Punishment (psychology)]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Scott A. | date=n.d. | title=Towards a Better Theory of Coercion, and a Use for It | publisher=The University of Chicago | url=http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | accessdate=12 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308180431/http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | archive-date=8 March 2005 }}\n* Lifton, Robert J.

It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]].

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies.

It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name=\"wozemployee\">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name=\"rice19850415\" />\n\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.\n\nApple is well known for its size and revenues.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper\".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>\n\nThe symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=205 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005}}</ref>\n\nThe first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. When one analyzes the [[semiotics]] with Saussure\u2019s model, the signified, or sign, is the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for the everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo had double meaning and differed from the many serious logos in existence at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Linzmayer, O. |first1=Owen |title=Apple confidential 2.0: The definitive history of the world\u2019s most colorful company. |date=2004 |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=1593270100 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nApple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a \u201cchallenger\u201d in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge. Thus, symbolizing Apple as a \u201crebellious young company\u201d ready to challenge the world.<ref name=SlideShare/> An even further semiotic analysis is that Adam and Eve gained a great deal of knowledge after the apple was bitten. So, the bitten apple is a sign for the \u201cpromise of knowledge\u201d that an Apple user may gain from the product.\n\nThe [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technologic viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] also argued that color was crucial for \u201chumanizing the company\u201d at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>\n\nThe only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]].

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies.

It stars [[Don Scardino]], [[Patricia Pearcy]], R.A. Dow, [[Jean Sullivan]], Peter MacLean, Fran Higgins, and [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]]. The film takes place in the fictional town of Fly Creek, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which becomes infested with carnivorous worms after a storm directs electricity from power lines onto wet soil. Lieberman was inspired to write the script from a childhood event involving electrocuting the ground and worms coming out.\n\nWith a majority of the budget funded by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producers [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar Lansbury]] and Joseph Beruh, the film was shot in [[Port Wentworth, Georgia]] in the course of five weeks. Millions of worms from Georgia and [[Maine]] were used during filming. Makeup artist [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] provided special effects for the film, using prosthetic makeup for the first time in his career. Being picked up for distribution by [[American International Pictures]], the film was edited down from an \"R\" rating to a \"PG\" rating. The film received negative reviews from critics but was still financially successful. ''Squirm'' was featured a tenth-season episode of the comedy television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the evening of September 29, 1975, in the rural town of Fly Creek, Georgia, wind from a powerful storm knocks an [[overhead power line]] down onto wet soil and starts to electrocute the worms underneath, leaving the town without electricity. The next morning, Geraldine \"Geri\" Sanders' boyfriend Mick is to arrive from New York City for a vacation in Fly Creek; she uses a truck belonging to her neighbor, worm farmer Roger Grimes, to pick up Mick. While the two go to town to get ice for the refrigerator, Roger's shipment of 100,000 [[Glycera (annelid)|bloodworms]] and [[Alitta virens|sandworms]] escape the truck. Mick enters a diner, where a customer says that over 300 thousand volts are being released into the ground from severed power lines. Mick orders an [[egg cream]], and finds a worm in it, though the owner and Sheriff Jim Reston believe he is pulling a prank.\n\nGeri introduces Mick to her mother, Naomi, and sister, Alma, before they both leave to browse at antique dealer Aaron Beardsley's house. Outside, Roger's father Willie finds the entire shipment of worms missing, and berates him for not paying attention to his work. Roger sees Mick alongside Geri and becomes envious of their relationship. Geri and Mick arrive at Beardsley's house; they do not find him, but Geri sees a human skeleton outside the property. They both bring Sheriff Reston over, but the remains disappear. Reston, thinking it is another prank, threatens to arrest Mick if he is seen in town again. When they ask around about Beardsley's whereabouts, they find out he was last seen before the storm. Mick believes that he himself unintentionally released the worms, so he apologizes to Roger and invites him out fishing with him and Geri. They later find the skeleton again, this time in Roger's truck.\n\nWhile on the boat, Mick is bitten when baiting his hook. Roger tells him that worms attack when electrified, and shows them his thumb was bitten by one as a child when Willie experimented with electricity at night. Mick leaves Geri with Roger so he can tend to his wound, and, alongside Alma, takes the skull from the truck to an abandoned dental office. Comparing its teeth with [[Dental radiography|X-rays]], they confirm that it is Beardsley's. Roger makes advances towards Geri against her wishes, but the worms they brought as bait attack him and crawl into his face. He runs off into the woods, and Geri tells Mick. When they try to find him at the worm farm, Mick finds Willie's body being eaten by the worms. They try telling Sheriff Reston again, but he does not listen to them. Mick deduces that Beardsley was killed by the worms, but cannot figure out why.\n\nWhile Mick and Geri are eating dinner with Naomi and Alma, the worms eat through the roots of a tree, causing it to crash into the house. Mick realizes that electricity is still being released from the power lines with the wet soil acting as a conductor, and also remembers that the worms only come out at night. He tells Geri to keep everyone inside equipped with candles and leaves to get plywood to board up the house. He is attacked and knocked unconscious by Roger, whose face is now deformed from the worms. Roger enters the house and kidnaps Geri. The worms infest the house, and numerous places in town are also taken over by them: Sheriff Reston and a woman are eaten alive in a jail cell, and people at Quigley's, a local bar, are also attacked and eaten.\n\nMick regains consciousness and finds Naomi's remains, covered in worms, at the house. When he goes upstairs, Roger attacks and chases him downstairs. Mick pushes Roger into a worm pile, where he is submerged. Mick frees Geri, and tells her that Naomi, and presumably Alma, are dead. The two try to escape, but Roger bites Mick in the leg while they climb out of a window. Mick beats Roger to death, before climbing into a tree, where he and Geri stay until morning. The worms disappear, and they both wake up to a repairman telling them the power has been restored. It is revealed that Alma survived when she climbs out of a [[Chest (furniture)|chest]] she had been hiding in, with Geri and Mick rushing into the house to meet her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Don Scardino]] as Mick\t\n* [[Patricia Pearcy]] as Geraldine \"Geri\" Sanders\t\n* R.A.

Lieberman said the script was inspired by a true event, where his brother connected an [[electric locomotive|electric train]] [[transformer]] to the ground, causing worms to come out of the ground. He completed the rough draft in six weeks before giving it to producer George Manasse, who saw potential in it. Manasse showed it to then-independent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producers [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar Lansbury]] and Joseph Beruh, who bought ''Squirm'' in 1975.

Wood also expressed disappointment with the film's ending, as he felt the survival of Mick, Geri, and Alma counteracted the film's logic. He interpreted the film's world being \"totally overwhelmed by eruptions of devouring worms that develop, initially, out of familiar constraints and sexual possessiveness\".{{sfn|Wood|2018}} Kyle B. Counts notes similarities between ''Squirm'' and [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|''Straw Dogs'']] in their themes of \"masculine ideals\". In both, the male leads play the hero.

It stars [[Don Scardino]], [[Patricia Pearcy]], R.A. Dow, [[Jean Sullivan]], Peter MacLean, Fran Higgins, and [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]]. The film takes place in the fictional town of Fly Creek, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which becomes infested with carnivorous worms after a storm directs electricity from power lines onto wet soil. Lieberman was inspired to write the script from a childhood event involving electrocuting the ground and worms coming out.\n\nWith a majority of the budget funded by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producers [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar Lansbury]] and Joseph Beruh, the film was shot in [[Port Wentworth, Georgia]] in the course of five weeks. Millions of worms from Georgia and [[Maine]] were used during filming. Makeup artist [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] provided special effects for the film, using prosthetic makeup for the first time in his career. Being picked up for distribution by [[American International Pictures]], the film was edited down from an \"R\" rating to a \"PG\" rating. The film received negative reviews from critics but was still financially successful. ''Squirm'' was featured a tenth-season episode of the comedy television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the evening of September 29, 1975, in the rural town of Fly Creek, Georgia, wind from a powerful storm knocks an [[overhead power line]] down onto wet soil and starts to electrocute the worms underneath, leaving the town without electricity. The next morning, Geraldine \"Geri\" Sanders' boyfriend Mick is to arrive from New York City for a vacation in Fly Creek; she uses a truck belonging to her neighbor, worm farmer Roger Grimes, to pick up Mick. While the two go to town to get ice for the refrigerator, Roger's shipment of 100,000 [[Glycera (annelid)|bloodworms]] and [[Alitta virens|sandworms]] escape the truck. Mick enters a diner, where a customer says that over 300 thousand volts are being released into the ground from severed power lines. Mick orders an [[egg cream]], and finds a worm in it, though the owner and Sheriff Jim Reston believe he is pulling a prank.\n\nGeri introduces Mick to her mother, Naomi, and sister, Alma, before they both leave to browse at antique dealer Aaron Beardsley's house. Outside, Roger's father Willie finds the entire shipment of worms missing, and berates him for not paying attention to his work. Roger sees Mick alongside Geri and becomes envious of their relationship. Geri and Mick arrive at Beardsley's house; they do not find him, but Geri sees a human skeleton outside the property. They both bring Sheriff Reston over, but the remains disappear. Reston, thinking it is another prank, threatens to arrest Mick if he is seen in town again. When they ask around about Beardsley's whereabouts, they find out he was last seen before the storm. Mick believes that he himself unintentionally released the worms, so he apologizes to Roger and invites him out fishing with him and Geri. They later find the skeleton again, this time in Roger's truck.\n\nWhile on the boat, Mick is bitten when baiting his hook. Roger tells him that worms attack when electrified, and shows them his thumb was bitten by one as a child when Willie experimented with electricity at night. Mick leaves Geri with Roger so he can tend to his wound, and, alongside Alma, takes the skull from the truck to an abandoned dental office. Comparing its teeth with [[Dental radiography|X-rays]], they confirm that it is Beardsley's. Roger makes advances towards Geri against her wishes, but the worms they brought as bait attack him and crawl into his face. He runs off into the woods, and Geri tells Mick. When they try to find him at the worm farm, Mick finds Willie's body being eaten by the worms. They try telling Sheriff Reston again, but he does not listen to them. Mick deduces that Beardsley was killed by the worms, but cannot figure out why.\n\nWhile Mick and Geri are eating dinner with Naomi and Alma, the worms eat through the roots of a tree, causing it to crash into the house. Mick realizes that electricity is still being released from the power lines with the wet soil acting as a conductor, and also remembers that the worms only come out at night. He tells Geri to keep everyone inside equipped with candles and leaves to get plywood to board up the house. He is attacked and knocked unconscious by Roger, whose face is now deformed from the worms. Roger enters the house and kidnaps Geri. The worms infest the house, and numerous places in town are also taken over by them: Sheriff Reston and a woman are eaten alive in a jail cell, and people at Quigley's, a local bar, are also attacked and eaten.\n\nMick regains consciousness and finds Naomi's remains, covered in worms, at the house. When he goes upstairs, Roger attacks and chases him downstairs. Mick pushes Roger into a worm pile, where he is submerged. Mick frees Geri, and tells her that Naomi, and presumably Alma, are dead. The two try to escape, but Roger bites Mick in the leg while they climb out of a window. Mick beats Roger to death, before climbing into a tree, where he and Geri stay until morning. The worms disappear, and they both wake up to a repairman telling them the power has been restored. It is revealed that Alma survived when she climbs out of a [[Chest (furniture)|chest]] she had been hiding in, with Geri and Mick rushing into the house to meet her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Don Scardino]] as Mick\t\n* [[Patricia Pearcy]] as Geraldine \"Geri\" Sanders\t\n* R.A.

Lieberman said the script was inspired by a true event, where his brother connected an [[electric locomotive|electric train]] [[transformer]] to the ground, causing worms to come out of the ground. He completed the rough draft in six weeks before giving it to producer George Manasse, who saw potential in it. Manasse showed it to then-independent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producers [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar Lansbury]] and Joseph Beruh, who bought ''Squirm'' in 1975. Though they had only a few investors, both of them still invested $470,000 into the project.

Q. Hunter disputes this, however, arguing that ''Jaws'' merely served to perpetuate the early-1970s genre that [[Quentin Tarantino]] called the \"Mother Nature goes ape-shit kind of movie\".{{sfn|Hunter|2016|p=85}} Muir calls ''Squirm'' one of the \"eco-horrors\" of the 1970s, along with ''Frogs'', ''Night of the Lepus'', ''Day of the Animals'', ''Kingdom of the Spiders'', ''Empire of the Ants'', ''The Swarm'', and ''[[Prophecy (film)|Prophecy]]''. These films reflected attitudes and fears prevalent at the time; specifically, they reflected the public's unease about what he called \"man's continued pillaging and pollution of the Earth\".{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=2}}\n\n[[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] used ''Squirm'' as an example of nature films linking \"natural\" force to sexual and familiar tensions. Wood also expressed disappointment with the film's ending, as he felt the survival of Mick, Geri, and Alma counteracted the film's logic. He interpreted the film's world being \"totally overwhelmed by eruptions of devouring worms that develop, initially, out of familiar constraints and sexual possessiveness\".{{sfn|Wood|2018}} Kyle B. Counts notes similarities between ''Squirm'' and [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|''Straw Dogs'']] in their themes of \"masculine ideals\". In both, the male leads play the hero. The reviewer, however, believed that the film did not give the impression that Don Scardino's character grew into a \"man\" after his experience.<ref name=Cinefantastique/>\n\nIn 2014, Liberman wrote a [[foreword]] for the book ''Subversive Horror Cinema: Countercultural Messages of Films from Frankenstein to the Present'' by Jon Towlson. In this, he addressed the critical and scholarly analysis of ''Squirm'':\n\n{{Cquote|quote=In my first movie, ''Squirm'' (1976), I really didn't try to make any sort of social or political comment. At least not consciously. However, soon after the movie's release, critics found some very profound subtexts which I myself wasn't aware of. Nature getting revenge on man for his disrespect of ecology. The symbolism of man's mortality and his inevitable fate of becoming worm food. Even themes of suppressed sexuality in the main characters.
