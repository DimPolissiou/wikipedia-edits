Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \u201cher plots are possible, logical, and always new.\u201d<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \u201cAt the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering \u2018How can this be happening?\u2019 Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe \u201cQueen of Fictional Crime\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fane|first=Vernon|url=|title=The World of Books|date=23 March 1946|work=The Sphere|access-date=|url-status=live|page=3}}</ref> developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of detective fiction.

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the U.S. sent an official letter of complaint to Christie\u2019s American publishers, ''Dodd, Mead and Company'', regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie\u2019s British literary agent later wrote to her U.S. representative, authorizing American publishers to \u201comit the word \u2018Jew\u2019 when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\u201d<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates. The [[Fulbright scholar]] Sally Finch (''Hickory Dickory'' ''Death'', also published as ''Hickory Dickory Dock'') is intelligent, attractive and innocent, even though Mrs. Nicoletis automatically assumes she will object to sharing house with students of other races.

She met her second husband, [[Max Mallowan|Sir Max Mallowan]], a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.{{sfn|Dever|2004|p=162}} Prior to meeting Mallowan, Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology, but once the two married, they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together. Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Similarly, throughout ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \u201cher plots are possible, logical, and always new.\u201d<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \u201cAt the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering \u2018How can this be happening?\u2019 Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\u201d<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe \u201cQueen of Fictional Crime\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fane|first=Vernon|url=|title=The World of Books|date=23 March 1946|work=The Sphere|access-date=|url-status=live|page=3}}</ref> developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of detective fiction.

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the U.S. sent an official letter of complaint to Christie\u2019s American publishers, ''Dodd, Mead and Company'', regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie\u2019s British literary agent later wrote to her U.S. representative, authorizing American publishers to \u201comit the word \u2018Jew\u2019 when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\u201d<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates. The [[Fulbright scholar]] Sally Finch (''Hickory Dickory'' ''Death'', also published as ''Hickory Dickory Dock'') is intelligent, attractive and innocent, even though Mrs. Nicoletis automatically assumes she will object to sharing house with students of other races. Another (foreign) student falsely labels Sally as being a fanatical anti-Communist simply because she is American (the book was written just after the McCarthy period, in 1955).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hickory Dickory Dock|last=Christie |first=Agatha|date=2017|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0008255534|oclc=999441027}}</ref> Anthony Browne (in ''Sparkling Cyanide'', also titled ''Remembered Death''), whom the book depicts as probably American, is suspected of being a spy.

She met her second husband, [[Max Mallowan|Sir Max Mallowan]], a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.{{sfn|Dever|2004|p=162}} Prior to meeting Mallowan, Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology, but once the two married, they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together. Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Similarly, throughout ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

A few months before the debut of Super Junior 05, Choi made his first media appearance with bandmate [[Han Geng]] as one of the runway models in a fashion show by Bum Suk.\n\nChoi debuted as part of 12-member rotational project group ''Super Junior 05'' on 6 November 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]' music program ''[[Inkigayo|Popular Songs]]'', performing their first single, \"[[Knockout (Triple 8 song)#Super Junior version|Twins (Knock Out)]]\". Their debut album ''[[Twins (Super Junior album)|Twins]]'' was released a month later on 5 December 2005 and debuted at number three  on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.\n\nIn March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. Following the addition of thirteenth member [[Cho Kyu-hyun|Kyuhyun]], the group dropped the suffix \"05\" and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry. They debuted in China at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \"[[U (Super Junior song)#Super Junior-M's cover|U]]\" on 8 April 2008. This was followed by the release of the debut Chinese-language [[studio album]], ''[[Me (Super Junior-M album)|Me]]'' in selected provinces in China on 23 April and 2 May in Taiwan.\n\n===Acting career===\nIn 2006, Choi was cast in the Hong Kong [[epic film]] ''[[A Battle of Wits (2006 film)|A Battle of Wits]]'', playing the role of the Liang Prince.

A few months before the debut of Super Junior 05, Choi made his first media appearance with bandmate [[Han Geng]] as one of the runway models in a fashion show by Bum Suk.\n\nChoi debuted as part of 12-member rotational project group ''Super Junior 05'' on 6 November 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]' music program ''[[Inkigayo|Popular Songs]]'', performing their first single, \"[[Knockout (Triple 8 song)#Super Junior version|Twins (Knock Out)]]\". Their debut album ''[[Twins (Super Junior album)|Twins]]'' was released a month later on 5 December 2005 and debuted at number three  on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.\n\nIn March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. Following the addition of thirteenth member [[Cho Kyu-hyun|Kyuhyun]], the group dropped the suffix \"05\" and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry. They debuted in China at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \"[[U (Super Junior song)#Super Junior-M's cover|U]]\" on 8 April 2008.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of [[cholesterol]], [[fatty acid]], and [[glucose]] [[homeostasis]]. LXRs were earlier classified as [[Orphan receptor|orphan]] nuclear receptors, however, upon discovery of endogenous oxysterols as ligands, they were subsequently deorphanized.\n\nTwo [[isoforms]] of LXR have been identified and are referred to as '''[[liver X receptor alpha|LXR\u03b1]]''' and '''[[liver X receptor beta|LXR\u03b2]]'''.  The liver X receptors are classified into subfamily 1 ([[thyroid hormone receptor]]-like) of the [[nuclear receptor]] superfamily, and are given the nuclear receptor nomenclature symbols NR1H3 (LXR\u03b1) and NR1H2 (LXR\u03b2) respectively.\n\nLXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2 were discovered separately between 1994-1995.

Glucose induces expression of LXR target genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis like [[ABCA1]] which is defective in [[Tangier disease]]. A common feature of many metabolic pathways is their control by [[retinoid X receptor]] (RXR) heterodimers. LXR heterodimerises with RXR. Promiscuous RXR also heterodimerises with PPAR members. PPAR-\u03b1 plays a pivotal role in fatty acid catabolism in liver by upregulating the expression of numerous genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Thus RXR is a common partner of two nuclear receptors acting in opposite directions with regard to fatty acid metabolism. So both LXR and PPAR-\u03b1 compete for the limited pool of RXR and this dynamic equilibrium determines the direction of lipid metabolism.<ref name = \"pmid18240340\">{{cite journal | author = Sanal MG | title = The blind men 'see' the elephant-the many faces of fatty liver disease | journal = World J.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of [[cholesterol]], [[fatty acid]], and [[glucose]] [[homeostasis]]. LXRs were earlier classified as [[Orphan receptor|orphan]] nuclear receptors, however, upon discovery of endogenous oxysterols as ligands, they were subsequently deorphanized.\n\nTwo [[isoforms]] of LXR have been identified and are referred to as '''[[liver X receptor alpha|LXR\u03b1]]''' and '''[[liver X receptor beta|LXR\u03b2]]'''.  The liver X receptors are classified into subfamily 1 ([[thyroid hormone receptor]]-like) of the [[nuclear receptor]] superfamily, and are given the nuclear receptor nomenclature symbols NR1H3 (LXR\u03b1) and NR1H2 (LXR\u03b2) respectively.\n\nLXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2 were discovered separately between 1994-1995.

Glucose induces expression of LXR target genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis like [[ABCA1]] which is defective in [[Tangier disease]]. A common feature of many metabolic pathways is their control by [[retinoid X receptor]] (RXR) heterodimers. LXR heterodimerises with RXR. Promiscuous RXR also heterodimerises with PPAR members. PPAR-\u03b1 plays a pivotal role in fatty acid catabolism in liver by upregulating the expression of numerous genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Thus RXR is a common partner of two nuclear receptors acting in opposite directions with regard to fatty acid metabolism. So both LXR and PPAR-\u03b1 compete for the limited pool of RXR and this dynamic equilibrium determines the direction of lipid metabolism.<ref name = \"pmid18240340\">{{cite journal | author = Sanal MG | title = The blind men 'see' the elephant-the many faces of fatty liver disease | journal = World J.
