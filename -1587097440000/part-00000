Courtship displays have been observed in weebills, where males ruffle cheek and head feathers with outstretched wings to the female. It is thought that male and female weebills display to each other at the nest-site with tail-fanning, slight bowing and wing quivering.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\nThe female usually lays two to four brown-speckled cream-colored [[Bird egg|eggs]]<ref name=HANZAB/> which are tapered-oval in shape.
