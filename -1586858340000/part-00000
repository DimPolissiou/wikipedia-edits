Their first cartoon together, the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', featuring a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, was released to theaters in 1940 and served as the pilot for the long-running theatrical short subject series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Hanna and Barbera served as directors of the shorts for over 20 years, with Hanna supervising the animation{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=83\u201384}} and Barbera in charge of the stories and pre-production.\n\nHaving been nominated for twelve Oscars, seven of the cartoons won seven [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] between 1943 and 1953, but these were awarded to producer [[Fred Quimby]], who was not involved in the creative development of the shorts.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=207}}{{rp|83\u201384}} The pair also directed new hybrid animated and live-action musical sequences for MGM's feature films ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (notable for its dance sequence featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]), ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'' and ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' and wrote and directed a handful of one-shot cartoons, ''[[Gallopin' Gals]]'', ''[[Officer Pooch]]'', ''[[War Dogs (1943 film)|War Dogs]]'' and ''[[Good Will to Men]]'', a 1955 remake of 1939's ''Peace on Earth''.\n\nWith Quimby's retirement in 1955, Hanna and Barbera became the producers in charge of the MGM animation studio's output,{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=547\u2013548}} supervising the last seven shorts of [[Tex Avery]]'s ''[[Droopy]]'' series and directing and producing a short-lived ''Tom and Jerry'' spin-off series, ''[[Spike and Tyke]]'', which ran for two entries.

[[Harry Cohn]], president and head of Columbia Pictures, took an 18% ownership in Hanna and Barbera's new company, '''H-B Enterprises''',<ref name=\"HannaRuffReddy\" /> and provided working capital. Screen Gems became the new studio's distributor and its licensing agent, handling merchandizing of the characters from the animated programs.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> The duo's cartoon firm officially opened for business in rented offices on the lot of Kling Studios (formerly [[Jim Henson Company Lot#Charlie Chaplin (1919\u20131952)|Charlie Chaplin Studios]]<ref name=\"jbarberainterviewvideo\" />) on July 7, 1957, two months after the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animation studio closed down.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}}\n\nSidney and several Screen Gems alumni became members of the studio's board of directors and much of the former MGM animation staff \u2014 including animators [[Carlo Vinci]], [[Kenneth Muse]], [[Lewis Marshall]], [[Michael Lah]] and [[Ed Barge]] and layout artists [[Ed Benedict]] and Richard Bickenbach \u2014 became the new production staff for the H-B studio.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}} Conductor and composer [[Hoyt Curtin]] was in charge of providing the music while many voice actors came on board, such as [[Daws Butler]], [[Don Messick]], [[Julie Bennett]], [[Mel Blanc]], [[Howard Morris]], [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]], [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] and [[Doug Young (voice actor)|Doug Young]].\n\n===1957\u20131969: Funny animals, sitcom families and more===\n[[File:Hb1957logo.jpg|right|thumb|Hanna-Barbera's first studio logo, used from 1957 to 1960.]]\nH-B Enterprises was the first major animation studio to successfully produce cartoons exclusively for television<ref>{{cite news|title= Caveman to Carp: The Prime-Time Cartoon Devolves|work=The New York Times|date=January 23, 1996|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/23/movies/caveman-to-carp-the-prime-time-cartoon-devolves.html?scp=27&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2009 |first=Jan |last=Benzel}}</ref> and after rebroadcasts of theatrical cartoons as programming, its first TV original ''[[The Ruff and Reddy Show]]'', premiered on [[NBC]] in December 1957.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=123}} ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' came next in 1958 and aired in most markets just before prime time.

''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' and its only theatrical short film series, ''[[Loopy De Loop]]'', would follow that year.\n\n''[[The Flintstones]]'' premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in prime time in 1960, loosely based on the CBS series ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. It was set in a fictionalized stone age of cavemen and dinosaurs. [[Jackie Gleason]] considered suing Hanna-Barbera for [[copyright infringement]], but decided not to because he did not want to be known as \"the man who yanked [[Fred Flintstone]] off the air\". The show ran for six seasons, becoming the longest-running animated show in American prime time at the time (until ''[[The Simpsons (TV series)|The Simpsons]]'' beat it in 1997), a ratings and merchandising success and the top-ranking animated program in syndication history. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, but its reputation eventually improved and it is now considered a classic.\n\n''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'' and ''[[Top Cat]]'' would soon follow in 1961. The three shows ''[[Wally Gator]]'', ''[[Touch\u00e9 Turtle and Dum Dum]]'' and ''[[Lippy the Lion & Hardy Har Har]]'' aired as part of ''[[The Hanna-Barbera New Cartoon Series]]'' then ''[[The Jetsons]]'' debuted in 1962. Several animated TV commercials were produced as well, often starring their own characters (probably the best known is a series of [[Pebbles cereal]] commercials for [[Post Foods|Post]] featuring [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] tricking Fred into giving him his Pebbles cereal) and H-B also produced the opening credits for ''[[Bewitched]]'', in which animated caricatures of Samantha and Darrin appeared. These characterizations were reused in the sixth season ''Flintstones'' episode \"''Samantha''\".\n\n[[File:HannaBarbera.JPG|thumb|left|The former Hanna-Barbera building at 3400 [[Cahuenga Boulevard]] West in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]], seen in a 2007 photograph.

Character designs were simplified, and backgrounds and animation cycles (walks, runs, etc.) were regularly re-purposed.\n\nCharacters were often broken up into a handful of levels so that only the parts of the body that needed to be moved at a given time (i.e. a mouth, an arm, a head) would be animated. The rest of the figure would remain on a held animation cel. This allowed a typical 10-minute short to be done with only 1,200 drawings instead of the usual 26,000. Dialogue, music, and sound effects were emphasized over action, leading [[Chuck Jones]]\u2014a contemporary who worked for [[Warner Bros.

The cost in quality of using this technique was that Hanna-Barbera's characters only moved when absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}}\n\nIts solution to the criticism over its quality was to go into movies. It produced six theatrical feature films, among them are higher-quality versions of its television cartoons (''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' and ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'') and adaptations of other material (''Charlotte's Web'', ''[[Heidi's Song]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]''). It was also one of the first animation studios to have their work produced overseas. One of these companies was a subsidiary started by Hanna-Barbera called Fil-Cartoons in the [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite news|title= TELEVISION; Peter Pan, Garfield and Bart \u2013 All Have Asian Roots|work=The New York Times|date=December 2, 1990|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/movies/television-peter-pan-garfield-and-bart-all-have-asian-roots.html?scp=45&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2010 |first=Barbara |last=Basler}}</ref> [[Wang Film Productions]] got its start as an overseas facility for the studio in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1281&CtNode=92&htx_TRCategory=&mp=4|title=Wang's World|publisher=Taiwan Info|last=Violet|first=Chang|date=May 1, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Sound effects===\nHanna-Barbera was noted for its large library of sound effects, which have been featured in exhibitions at the Norman Rockwell Museum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Norman Rockwell Museum Presents \u201cHanna-Barbera: The Architects of Saturday Morning\u201d |url=https://www.nrm.org/2016/12/norman-rockwell-museum-presents-hanna-barbera-architects-saturday-morning/ |website=Norman Rockwell Museum |accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==List of Hanna-Barbera productions==\n{{main|List of works produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cartoon|Companies|Film|United States}}\n* [[List of Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n* [[Screen Gems]]\n* [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]\n* [[List of films based on Hanna-Barbera cartoons]]\n* [[List of Hanna-Barbera-based video games]]\n* [[Hanna-Barbera in amusement parks]]\n* [[List of works produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions#Hanna\u2013Barbera Classics Collection|Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection]]\n* [[Golden age of American animation]]\n* [[Animation in the United States in the television era]]\n* [[Laugh track]]\n* [[List of animation studios owned by Warner Bros.

Their first cartoon together, the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', featuring a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, was released to theaters in 1940 and served as the pilot for the long-running theatrical short subject series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Hanna and Barbera served as directors of the shorts for over 20 years, with Hanna supervising the animation{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=83\u201384}} and Barbera in charge of the stories and pre-production.\n\nHaving been nominated for twelve Oscars, seven of the cartoons won seven [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] between 1943 and 1953, but these were awarded to producer [[Fred Quimby]], who was not involved in the creative development of the shorts.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=207}}{{rp|83\u201384}} The pair also directed new hybrid animated and live-action musical sequences for MGM's feature films ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (notable for its dance sequence featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]), ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'' and ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' and wrote and directed a handful of one-shot cartoons, ''[[Gallopin' Gals]]'', ''[[Officer Pooch]]'', ''[[War Dogs (1943 film)|War Dogs]]'' and ''[[Good Will to Men]]'', a 1955 remake of 1939's ''Peace on Earth''.\n\nWith Quimby's retirement in 1955, Hanna and Barbera became the producers in charge of the MGM animation studio's output,{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=547\u2013548}} supervising the last seven shorts of [[Tex Avery]]'s ''[[Droopy]]'' series and directing and producing a short-lived ''Tom and Jerry'' spin-off series, ''[[Spike and Tyke]]'', which ran for two entries.

[[Harry Cohn]], president and head of Columbia Pictures, took an 18% ownership in Hanna and Barbera's new company, '''H-B Enterprises''',<ref name=\"HannaRuffReddy\" /> and provided working capital. Screen Gems became the new studio's distributor and its licensing agent, handling merchandizing of the characters from the animated programs.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> The duo's cartoon firm officially opened for business in rented offices on the lot of Kling Studios (formerly [[Jim Henson Company Lot#Charlie Chaplin (1919\u20131952)|Charlie Chaplin Studios]]<ref name=\"jbarberainterviewvideo\" />) on July 7, 1957, two months after the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animation studio closed down.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}}\n\nSidney and several Screen Gems alumni became members of the studio's board of directors and much of the former MGM animation staff \u2014 including animators [[Carlo Vinci]], [[Kenneth Muse]], [[Lewis Marshall]], [[Michael Lah]] and [[Ed Barge]] and layout artists [[Ed Benedict]] and Richard Bickenbach \u2014 became the new production staff for the H-B studio.{{sfn|Barrier|2003|pp=560\u2013562}} Conductor and composer [[Hoyt Curtin]] was in charge of providing the music while many voice actors came on board, such as [[Daws Butler]], [[Don Messick]], [[Julie Bennett]], [[Mel Blanc]], [[Howard Morris]], [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]], [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] and [[Doug Young (voice actor)|Doug Young]].\n\n===1957\u20131969: Funny animals, sitcom families and more===\n[[File:Hb1957logo.jpg|right|thumb|Hanna-Barbera's first studio logo, used from 1957 to 1960.]]\nH-B Enterprises was the first major animation studio to successfully produce cartoons exclusively for television<ref>{{cite news|title= Caveman to Carp: The Prime-Time Cartoon Devolves|work=The New York Times|date=January 23, 1996|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/23/movies/caveman-to-carp-the-prime-time-cartoon-devolves.html?scp=27&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2009 |first=Jan |last=Benzel}}</ref> and after rebroadcasts of theatrical cartoons as programming, its first TV original ''[[The Ruff and Reddy Show]]'', premiered on [[NBC]] in December 1957.{{sfn|Barbera|1994|p=123}} ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' came next in 1958 and aired in most markets just before prime time.

''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' and its only theatrical short film series, ''[[Loopy De Loop]]'', would follow that year.\n\n''[[The Flintstones]]'' premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in prime time in 1960, loosely based on the CBS series ''[[The Honeymooners]]''. It was set in a fictionalized stone age of cavemen and dinosaurs. [[Jackie Gleason]] considered suing Hanna-Barbera for [[copyright infringement]], but decided not to because he did not want to be known as \"the man who yanked [[Fred Flintstone]] off the air\". The show ran for six seasons, becoming the longest-running animated show in American prime time at the time (until ''[[The Simpsons (TV series)|The Simpsons]]'' beat it in 1997), a ratings and merchandising success and the top-ranking animated program in syndication history. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, but its reputation eventually improved and it is now considered a classic.\n\n''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'' and ''[[Top Cat]]'' would soon follow in 1961. The three shows ''[[Wally Gator]]'', ''[[Touch\u00e9 Turtle and Dum Dum]]'' and ''[[Lippy the Lion & Hardy Har Har]]'' aired as part of ''[[The Hanna-Barbera New Cartoon Series]]'' then ''[[The Jetsons]]'' debuted in 1962. Several animated TV commercials were produced as well, often starring their own characters (probably the best known is a series of [[Pebbles cereal]] commercials for [[Post Foods|Post]] featuring [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] tricking Fred into giving him his Pebbles cereal) and H-B also produced the opening credits for ''[[Bewitched]]'', in which animated caricatures of Samantha and Darrin appeared.

While the budget for MGM's seven-minute ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts was about $35,000, the Hanna-Barbera studios was required to produce five-minute ''Ruff and Reddy'' episodes for no more than $3,000 a piece.<ref name=\"HannaRuffReddy\">Hanna, William and Ito, Tom (1999). ''A Cast of Friends''. New York: Da Capo Press. 0306-80917-6.

Character designs were simplified, and backgrounds and animation cycles (walks, runs, etc.) were regularly re-purposed.\n\nCharacters were often broken up into a handful of levels so that only the parts of the body that needed to be moved at a given time (i.e. a mouth, an arm, a head) would be animated. The rest of the figure would remain on a held animation cel. This allowed a typical 10-minute short to be done with only 1,200 drawings instead of the usual 26,000. Dialogue, music, and sound effects were emphasized over action, leading [[Chuck Jones]]\u2014a contemporary who worked for [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] and whose short ''[[The Dover Boys]]'' practically invented many of the concepts in limited animation\u2014to disparagingly refer to the limited television cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera and others as \"illustrated radio\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Cartoons-THE-GOLDEN-ERA.html|title=The golden era - Cartoons - film, director, music|work=filmreference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a story published by ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1961, critics stated that Hanna-Barbera was taking on more work than it could handle and was resorting to shortcuts only a television audience would tolerate.<ref name=\"SEP\" /> An executive who worked for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] said, \"We don't even consider [them] competition\".<ref name=\"SEP\">(Dec. 2, 1961) \"[http://dawsbutler.com/hb-article-web/hb-article-05.jpg TV'S Most Unexpected Hit \u2013 ''The Flintstones'']\" ''The Saturday Evening Post''</ref> Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman argues that Hanna-Barbera attempted to maximize their [[Net income|bottom line]] by recycling story formulas and characterization instead of introducing new ones. Once a formula for an original series was deemed successful, the studio would keep reusing it in subsequent series.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}} Besides copying their own works, Hanna-Barbera would draw inspiration from the works of other people and studios.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}}\n\nLehman considers that the studio served as a main example of how animation studios which focused on TV animation differed from those that focused on theatrical animation. Theatrical animation studios tried to maintain full and fluid animation, and consequently struggled with the rising expenses associated with producing it.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}} Limited animation as practiced by Hanna-Barbera kept production costs at a minimum. The cost in quality of using this technique was that Hanna-Barbera's characters only moved when absolutely necessary.{{sfn|Lehman|2007|p=25}}\n\nIts solution to the criticism over its quality was to go into movies. It produced six theatrical feature films, among them are higher-quality versions of its television cartoons (''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' and ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'') and adaptations of other material (''Charlotte's Web'', ''[[Heidi's Song]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'').

In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''lev\u00e9e en masse'') with a call to service:<blockquote>Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army.

Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War.

Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically.

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.

It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 \"[[What is a Nation?]]\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily [[plebiscite]]\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.<ref name=\"blackwell\"/>\n\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country.

The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. However, even in that early stage there was an ideological critique of nationalism which has developed into several forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and anti-nationalism. The [[Islamic revival]] of the 20th century also produced an [[Islamism|Islamist]] critique of the nation-state. (see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2008-08-02|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place.

When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]].

In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''lev\u00e9e en masse'') with a call to service:<blockquote>Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army.

Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War.

Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically.

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.

It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 \"[[What is a Nation?]]\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily [[plebiscite]]\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.<ref name=\"blackwell\"/>\n\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country.

The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. However, even in that early stage there was an ideological critique of nationalism which has developed into several forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and anti-nationalism. The [[Islamic revival]] of the 20th century also produced an [[Islamism|Islamist]] critique of the nation-state. (see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2008-08-02|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place.

When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]].

The story concerns a mother with a sometimes-violent teenage son, struggling to control his behaviour in a hypothetical future in which parents have the legal option to commit troubled youth to public hospitals.\n\nThe story focuses on mother\u2013son relationships, a reoccurring theme in Dolan's work, and also marks his fourth collaboration with Dorval and his third with Cl\u00e9ment. Inspiration for this particular story was drawn from Dolan's discovery of Pilon and the music of [[Ludovico Einaudi]]. It was shot in Quebec in an unconventional 1:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].\n\nThe film debuted at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]]. It subsequently became a critical and financial success, grossing over [[United States dollar|$]]13 million worldwide. ''Mommy'' went on to win numerous other awards, among them nine [[3rd Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a fictional outcome for the [[2015 Canadian federal election]], a political party comes to power and establishes a law called S-14, allowing parents of troubled children and limited finances to place their children in hospitals, without regard for [[fundamental justice]].\n\nAfter the law is passed, Diane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s, a widowed mother and 46-year-old journalist, picks up her son Steve, who has [[ADHD]] with violent tendencies, from an institution. Steve has started a fire at the institution, in which another youth was injured. Die brings Steve to their new home in [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and struggles to care for him under financial distress. He gives her a cart full of groceries and a necklace reading \"Mommy\", which she suspects that he has stolen. Enraged by the accusation, Steve begins choking her, and she defends herself by hitting him with a glass frame. Whilst chaos ensues  Kyla, a neighbour and teacher on sabbatical, shows up to tend to their wounds.\n\nKyla, who is dealing with a [[stutter]]ing problem, begins to tutor Steve. After a disastrous tutoring session where Steve berates Kyla she snaps. After the confrontation Steve mellows and indicates he is glad to know her and respects her wishes not to call her \"babe\". Although the three have bonded, Die is served papers by the parents of the injured boy indicating she and Steve are being sued for the injuries caused by his fire.\n\nDie finds a lawyer willing to help them and the three of them go out for the evening for something to eat. They end up at a [[karaoke]] bar, where Steve is increasingly agitated by the atmosphere and what he sees as his mother, Die's sexual interest in the lawyer. Steve decides to sing, but is taunted by the audience, leading to a fight. Steve, Die and their lawyer argue, ending with Die slapping the lawyer for slapping Steve, which drives the lawyer away.\n\nDie continues to try and help her son and rebuild their lives, but while out shopping, with Steve and Kyla, Steve disappears and slits his wrist. He survives and a little later Die finds herself reflecting on all the dreams she had for her son to live a fulfilled happy life. She finally drives to a hospital to commit him under S-14; Steve angrily resists, and she regrets the decision when she sees the officials use violence and [[taser]]s to subdue him, but there is nothing she can legally do.\n\nKyla announces she is moving to [[Toronto]] and Die encourages her and expresses hope for Steve, but after Kyla leaves her alone in the house Die is shown to be extremely distressed at how things are resurfacing. Back at the hospital, Steve is being unstrapped from the straight-jacket by officials. Immediately after the straps are removed, Steve flees towards a large window.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anne Dorval]] as Diane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s\n* [[Antoine Olivier Pilon]] as Steve Despr\u00e9s\n* [[Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment]] as Kyla\n* Alexandre Goyette as Patrick\n* [[Patrick Huard]] as Paul B\u00e9liveau\n* Steven Chevrin as older Steve<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xdolan |number=517232867005722624 |date=1 October 2014 |title=non.

The story concerns a mother with a sometimes-violent teenage son, struggling to control his behaviour in a hypothetical future in which parents have the legal option to commit troubled youth to public hospitals.\n\nThe story focuses on mother\u2013son relationships, a reoccurring theme in Dolan's work, and also marks his fourth collaboration with Dorval and his third with Cl\u00e9ment. Inspiration for this particular story was drawn from Dolan's discovery of Pilon and the music of [[Ludovico Einaudi]]. It was shot in Quebec in an unconventional 1:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].\n\nThe film debuted at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]]. It subsequently became a critical and financial success, grossing over [[United States dollar|$]]13 million worldwide. ''Mommy'' went on to win numerous other awards, among them nine [[3rd Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]], including [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a fictional outcome for the [[2015 Canadian federal election]], a political party comes to power and establishes a law called S-14, allowing parents of troubled children and limited finances to place their children in hospitals, without regard for [[fundamental justice]].\n\nAfter the law is passed, Diane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s, a widowed mother and 46-year-old journalist, picks up her son Steve, who has [[ADHD]] with violent tendencies, from an institution. Steve has started a fire at the institution, in which another youth was injured. Die brings Steve to their new home in [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and struggles to care for him under financial distress. He gives her a cart full of groceries and a necklace reading \"Mommy\", which she suspects that he has stolen. Enraged by the accusation, Steve begins choking her, and she defends herself by hitting him with a glass frame. Whilst chaos ensues  Kyla, a neighbour and teacher on sabbatical, shows up to tend to their wounds.\n\nKyla, who is dealing with a [[stutter]]ing problem, begins to tutor Steve. After a disastrous tutoring session where Steve berates Kyla she snaps. After the confrontation Steve mellows and indicates he is glad to know her and respects her wishes not to call her \"babe\". Although the three have bonded, Die is served papers by the parents of the injured boy indicating she and Steve are being sued for the injuries caused by his fire.\n\nDie finds a lawyer willing to help them and the three of them go out for the evening for something to eat. They end up at a [[karaoke]] bar, where Steve is increasingly agitated by the atmosphere and what he sees as his mother, Die's sexual interest in the lawyer. Steve decides to sing, but is taunted by the audience, leading to a fight. Steve, Die and their lawyer argue, ending with Die slapping the lawyer for slapping Steve, which drives the lawyer away.\n\nDie continues to try and help her son and rebuild their lives, but while out shopping, with Steve and Kyla, Steve disappears and slits his wrist. He survives and a little later Die finds herself reflecting on all the dreams she had for her son to live a fulfilled happy life. She finally drives to a hospital to commit him under S-14; Steve angrily resists, and she regrets the decision when she sees the officials use violence and [[taser]]s to subdue him, but there is nothing she can legally do.\n\nKyla announces she is moving to [[Toronto]] and Die encourages her and expresses hope for Steve, but after Kyla leaves her alone in the house Die is shown to be extremely distressed at how things are resurfacing. Back at the hospital, Steve is being unstrapped from the straight-jacket by officials. Immediately after the straps are removed, Steve flees towards a large window.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anne Dorval]] as Diane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s\n* [[Antoine Olivier Pilon]] as Steve Despr\u00e9s\n* [[Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment]] as Kyla\n* Alexandre Goyette as Patrick\n* [[Patrick Huard]] as Paul B\u00e9liveau\n* Steven Chevrin as older Steve<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xdolan |number=517232867005722624 |date=1 October 2014 |title=non.

It is estimated Fulk constructed approximately 100 castles, along with abbeys throughout the [[Loire Valley]] in what is now France. He fought successive wars with neighbors in [[Brittany]], [[Blois]], [[Poitou]] and [[Aquitaine]] and made four pilgrimages to [[Jerusalem]] during the course of his life.

With his county seat at Angers, Fulk\u2019s bitter enemy was [[Eudes II of Blois]], his neighbor 128&nbsp;km east along the Loire River, at Tours. The two men traded towns, followers and insults throughout their lives.\n\nFulk finished his first castle at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Langeais|Langeais]], 104&nbsp;km east of Angers, on the banks of the Loire.{{sfn|Kennedy|1995|p=12}} Like many of his constructions, it began as a wooden tower, and was eventually replaced with a stone structure, fortified with exterior walls, and equipped with a thick-walled tower called a ''donjon'' in French (source of the English dungeon, which however implies a cellar, rather than a tower). He built it in the territory of Eudes I, Count of Blois, and they fought a battle over it in 994. But Eudes I died of a sudden illness, and his son and successor, Eudes II, did not manage to evict him.\n\nFulk continued building more towers in a slow encirclement of Tours:  [[Montbazon]], Montr\u00e9sor, Mirebeau, [[Montrichard]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Loches|Loches]], and even the tower of Montboyau, erected just across the Loire from Tours in 1016. He also fortified the castles at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Angers|Angers]], [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|Amboise]], Chateau-Gontier, [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chinon|Chinon]], Mayenne and Semblan\u00e7ay, among many others. \u201cThe construction of castles for the purpose of extending a ruler\u2019s power was part of Fulk ''Nerra''\u2019s strategy,\u201d wrote Peter Fraser Purton, in ''A History of Medieval Siege, c. 450\u20131220''.\n\nFulk was a devout Christian, who built, enlarged or endowed several abbeys and monasteries, such as the Abbey of [[Beaulieu-les-Loches]], Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, Saint-Aubin, and a  convent, Notre Dame de la Charit\u00e9 at Ronceray in Angers. Although he never learned to write, he endowed a school with revenue to provide poor students with an education. Fulk also undertook four [[pilgrimages]] to Jerusalem.\n\n== Family ==\nHe was the son of [[Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey I of Anjou]], also known as Geoffrey ''Grisegonelle'', and [[Adele of Meaux|Ad\u00e9laide of Vermandois]].{{sfn|Bachrach|1993|p=262}} He had an older sister: Hermengarde (b. 960), who married [[Conan I of Rennes|Conan of Brittany]] and a younger brother Geoffrey.{{sfn|Bachrach|1993|p=262}} A half-brother, Maurice, was born in 980.{{sfn|Bachrach|1993|p=14}}\n\nFulk married Elisabeth de Vend\u00f4me (~979\u2013999), daughter of Count Bouchard of Vendome,{{sfn|Bachrach|1993|p=16}} and they had a daughter:\n* Ad\u00e8le.,{{sfn|Bachrach|1993|p=262}} married Bodon, son of Landry, Count of Nevers.

Conan\u2019s territorial ambitions had been quashed by Geoffroy Grisgonelle in 980, and seven years later, he planned an ambush on Angers while Fulk was at the crowning of [[Robert II of France|Robert the Pious]]. Fulk and his men foiled the ambush, killing Conan\u2019s son, Alain, in the process. In 992 Fulk laid siege to Conan\u2019s castle at Nantes, but he slipped away to Conquereuil. Conan was killed in the battle, and Fulk installed a governor/regent, as the succeeding count was a child.\n\nWhile Fulk  and Eudes II fought many skirmishes over territory and alliances, their biggest battle occurred in July 1016 at [[Battle of Pontlevoy]]. Eudes marched 10,000 men southward toward Fulk\u2019s tower at Montboyau; meanwhile, Fulk and his much smaller group attacked him from behind. Fulk\u2019s men were routed, retreated, and Eudes, thinking the battle won, went for a swim in the Cher River. Reinforcements led by Herbert Wake-Dog of Maine arrived to help Fulk, fought and routed Eudes' surprised men.

In 1003, Fulk traveled to Jerusalem for his first pilgrimage. The journey was across the Alps at the Grand Bernard Pass in today\u2019s Switzerland, over land to Bari in the southern Italian peninsula (a stop in Rome was usually made), by ship to the Holy Land. The travel took as long as six months, through deeply dangerous territory.<ref>[Jonathan Sumption, ''The Age of Pilgrimage, The Medieval Journey to God'', Paulist Press, 2003]</ref>\n\nFulk made a second pilgrimage in 1008, obliged to do so by the king as punishment after Fulk ordered the [[murder]] of an enemy. For his third and fourth trips, Fulk had a moral obligation to protect pilgrims in the years following the desecration of Jerusalem by the [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|\"Mad Caliph\" Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], and provided armed security against robbers, murderers and enslavers along the route. In 1035, the third pilgrimage with [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]] and in 1038, he made his final pilgrimage. He died in [[Metz]] in 1040 on his return from that trip, and was buried in the chapel of his monastery at [[Beaulieu-l\u00e8s-Loches|Beaulieu]].\n\n[[Image:ChristianBauer Chateau de Loches dungeon.jpg|thumb|200px|Fulk ''Nerra'''s castle keep at [[Loches]].]]\n\n== Succession ==\nGeoffroy Martel was Count of Anjou from 1040 to 1060, but had no children from either of two marriages.
