It is {{convert|82|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} east from the county capital [[Miskolc]].\n\n== History ==\n''S\u00e1tor-alja'' (meaning \"under the tent\", referring to the tent-shaped hill nearby) was a settlement from the Conquest of Hungary until the [[Tatars]] destroyed the town. It was rebuilt in the 13th century, although there was disagreement among the citizens concerning the name: some wanted to keep the original name, and some wanted to rename it ''\u00faj hely'' (\"new place\").\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely was granted town status in 1261 by King [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]], and a castle was also built around that time.\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely has often played an important role in the region's history: revolts against [[Habsburg]] [[Habsburg Monarchy|rule]] began there in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the [[Revolution of 1848]], S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely developed rapidly owing to its location close to important trade routes leading to [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Transylvania]]. The town's light industry led to it becoming the capital of the ''comitatus'' (county) of [[Zempl\u00e9n County|Zempl\u00e9n]] in the 17th century.\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely has always been an important town in culture. [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], one of the reformers of the [[Hungarian language]], lived here in the 18th century. At the turn of the 20th century the town was home to a small but important [[Hungarian Jews|Jewish]] community: some 4,500 of the town's 13,000 residents were Jewish. The community counted among its members [[Moses Teitelbaum]] and [[Michael Heilprin]].\n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Hungary lost its northern territories. The border was set at the Ronyva stream, splitting the city into two parts. One-fifth of the population and one-fourth of the territory of the town became part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The newly created village got the name of [[Slovensk\u00e9 Nov\u00e9 Mesto]] (\"Slovak new town\") in Slovak; ''Szlov\u00e1k\u00fajhely'' (\"Slovak new town\") or ''Kis\u00fajhely'' (\"Little new town\") in Hungarian. Two railway lines and the industrial zone were lost to Hungary. The town's industry was being rebuilt during the [[interwar period]], but the outbreak of [[World War II]] disrupted this development. Nazi repression, continuous bombing after 1943, the killing of most of its Jewish population (most were forcibly sent to Auschwitz) and finally the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation left the town in a very poor condition.\n\nDuring the reorganisation of administration in 1950, the former ''comitatus'' of Zempl\u00e9n became part of the united [[Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n]] county, and S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely lost its county capital status.\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely was rebuilt again and is today a national ski centre and tourism destination.\n\n=== Jewish history ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:satoralja2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Abandoned Jewish [[synagogue]] and [[Jewish cemetery|cemetery]]]]\n[[Historically]], Ujhely (S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely) belonged to the [[county of Zemplin]]. Documents show that in 1734 [[Jews]] were living at S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely and that they were allowed to acquire real estate. It is evident that the community was then increasing; for 10 years later the Jews possessed a school which in 1829 received a bequest of 260,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] from [[Martin Raphael K\u00e4stenbaum]], and which was thenceforth known by his name.\n\nThe oldest tombstone bears date of 1760, although the [[\u1e25ebra \u1e33addisha]], with which was connected to a hospital, was not established until 1772, its founder being an itinerant [[rabbi]] named [[Naphtali Hirsch]]. The first \u1e25ebrabook has a drawing on its title-page representing the last rites.\n\nA synagogue was built at S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely in 1790; and when it was demolished in 1887, to be replaced by a new [[house of worship]], it was found to have 8 subterranean chambers, which probably served as dungeons. The oldest document of the community is dated 1831, during the rabbinate of [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum]], of whom the story is told that [[Lajos Kossuth]], afterward leader of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], when suffering from an infantile sickness, was brought to him, and that the rabbi blessed the child and, referring to the word ''\"[[\u1e33oshe\u1e6d]]\"'' in Psalm lx. 6 (A. V. 4), prophesied his future greatness. Teitelbaum died in 1841, and was succeeded by his grandson [[Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum (I)|Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum]], who in about year 1848 went to [[Gorlice]].\n\n[[Jeremiah L\u00f6w]] was then appointed rabbi of Ujhely. L\u00f6w, who was one of the leaders of the Orthodox party, was succeeded by the chief rabbi, [[Koloman Weisz]], and the preacher [[Isidor Goldberger]]. [[Michael Heilprin]], who acted as secretary to Minister [[Bertalan Szemere]] in 1848, was, prior to the Revolution, a teacher in the [[Jewish school]] of Ujhely.\n\nThe Jews of the city in 1905 numbered 4,500 out of a total population of 13,000.\n<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia Bibliography: [[Albert Sz\u00e9kely]], ''Ujhelyi Zsid\u00f3k T\u00f6rt\u00e9nete'', in ''Magyarorsz\u00e1g V\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s V\u00e1rosai'' (in manuscript)</ref>\n\n== Tourist sights ==\n* Historical downtown (with an atmosphere of 19th-century towns)\n* Main Church and Comitatus Fountain at the town square\n* Wine Church, the only known church in Hungary not owned by any denomination, as it was used to store wine in past centuries.\n* [[Ferenc Kazinczy]] Mausoleum\n* [[Ferenc Kazinczy Museum]]\n* [[Waldbott-villa]]\n* [[Baroque]] town hall, a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] building of the former [[Zempl\u00e9n County|Zempl\u00e9n]] comitatus where Ferenc Kazinczy worked.\n* Former Financial Palace, a mark of the town's great economic importance in the 19th and the early 20th century.\n* Abandoned synagogue cemetery -

It is {{convert|82|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} east from the county capital [[Miskolc]].\n\n== History ==\n''S\u00e1tor-alja'' (meaning \"under the tent\", referring to the tent-shaped hill nearby) was a settlement from the Conquest of Hungary until the [[Tatars]] destroyed the town. It was rebuilt in the 13th century, although there was disagreement among the citizens concerning the name: some wanted to keep the original name, and some wanted to rename it ''\u00faj hely'' (\"new place\").\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely was granted town status in 1261 by King [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]], and a castle was also built around that time.\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely has often played an important role in the region's history: revolts against [[Habsburg]] [[Habsburg Monarchy|rule]] began there in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the [[Revolution of 1848]], S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely developed rapidly owing to its location close to important trade routes leading to [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Transylvania]]. The town's light industry led to it becoming the capital of the ''comitatus'' (county) of [[Zempl\u00e9n County|Zempl\u00e9n]] in the 17th century.\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely has always been an important town in culture. [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], one of the reformers of the [[Hungarian language]], lived here in the 18th century. At the turn of the 20th century the town was home to a small but important [[Hungarian Jews|Jewish]] community: some 4,500 of the town's 13,000 residents were Jewish. The community counted among its members [[Moses Teitelbaum]] and [[Michael Heilprin]].\n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Hungary lost its northern territories. The border was set at the Ronyva stream, splitting the city into two parts. One-fifth of the population and one-fourth of the territory of the town became part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The newly created village got the name of [[Slovensk\u00e9 Nov\u00e9 Mesto]] (\"Slovak new town\") in Slovak; ''Szlov\u00e1k\u00fajhely'' (\"Slovak new town\") or ''Kis\u00fajhely'' (\"Little new town\") in Hungarian. Two railway lines and the industrial zone were lost to Hungary. The town's industry was being rebuilt during the [[interwar period]], but the outbreak of [[World War II]] disrupted this development. Nazi repression, continuous bombing after 1943, the killing of most of its Jewish population (most were forcibly sent to Auschwitz) and finally the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation left the town in a very poor condition.\n\nDuring the reorganisation of administration in 1950, the former ''comitatus'' of Zempl\u00e9n became part of the united [[Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n]] county, and S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely lost its county capital status.\n\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely was rebuilt again and is today a national ski centre and tourism destination.\n\n=== Jewish history ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:satoralja2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Abandoned Jewish [[synagogue]] and [[Jewish cemetery|cemetery]]]]\n[[Historically]], Ujhely (S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely) belonged to the [[county of Zemplin]]. Documents show that in 1734 [[Jews]] were living at S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely and that they were allowed to acquire real estate. It is evident that the community was then increasing; for 10 years later the Jews possessed a school which in 1829 received a bequest of 260,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] from [[Martin Raphael K\u00e4stenbaum]], and which was thenceforth known by his name.\n\nThe oldest tombstone bears date of 1760, although the [[\u1e25ebra \u1e33addisha]], with which was connected to a hospital, was not established until 1772, its founder being an itinerant [[rabbi]] named [[Naphtali Hirsch]]. The first \u1e25ebrabook has a drawing on its title-page representing the last rites.\n\nA synagogue was built at S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely in 1790; and when it was demolished in 1887, to be replaced by a new [[house of worship]], it was found to have 8 subterranean chambers, which probably served as dungeons. The oldest document of the community is dated 1831, during the rabbinate of [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum]], of whom the story is told that [[Lajos Kossuth]], afterward leader of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], when suffering from an infantile sickness, was brought to him, and that the rabbi blessed the child and, referring to the word ''\"[[\u1e33oshe\u1e6d]]\"'' in Psalm lx. 6 (A. V. 4), prophesied his future greatness. Teitelbaum died in 1841, and was succeeded by his grandson [[Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum (I)|Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum]], who in about year 1848 went to [[Gorlice]].\n\n[[Jeremiah L\u00f6w]] was then appointed rabbi of Ujhely. L\u00f6w, who was one of the leaders of the Orthodox party, was succeeded by the chief rabbi, [[Koloman Weisz]], and the preacher [[Isidor Goldberger]]. [[Michael Heilprin]], who acted as secretary to Minister [[Bertalan Szemere]] in 1848, was, prior to the Revolution, a teacher in the [[Jewish school]] of Ujhely.\n\nThe Jews of the city in 1905 numbered 4,500 out of a total population of 13,000.\n<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia Bibliography: [[Albert Sz\u00e9kely]], ''Ujhelyi Zsid\u00f3k T\u00f6rt\u00e9nete'', in ''Magyarorsz\u00e1g V\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s V\u00e1rosai'' (in manuscript)</ref>\n\n== Tourist sights ==\n* Historical downtown (with an atmosphere of 19th-century towns)\n* Main Church and Comitatus Fountain at the town square\n* Wine Church, the only known church in Hungary not owned by any denomination, as it was used to store wine in past centuries.\n* [[Ferenc Kazinczy]] Mausoleum\n* [[Ferenc Kazinczy Museum]]\n* [[Waldbott-villa]]\n* [[Baroque]] town hall, a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] building of the former [[Zempl\u00e9n County|Zempl\u00e9n]] comitatus where Ferenc Kazinczy worked.\n* Former Financial Palace, a mark of the town's great economic importance in the 19th and the early 20th century.\n* Abandoned synagogue cemetery - S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely was once home to Hungary's second-largest [[Jew]]ish community.\n* Tomb of Rabbi [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum]]\n* [[Chairlift]]\n\n== Famous residents ==\n{{Category see also|People from S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely}}\n* [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]], prime minister\n* Dr. [[Ervin Brody]], scholar, writer and table tennis team captain\n* [[Angelo Heilprin]], naturalist\n* [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], writer\n* [[Lajos Kossuth]], governor\n* [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moshe Teitelbaum]], famous rebe\n* [[Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum (I)]], rebbe\n* [[Katalin Vad]], pornographic actress\n* Rose Schotz, mother of [[Est\u00e9e Lauder (businesswoman)|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]\n* [[Benjamin Wolf L\u00f6w]], rabbi\n* [[rebbe]]s of the [[Ujhel-Siget (Hasidic dynasty)|Ujhel-Siget]], Ujhel ([[Teitelbaum]] family of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] origin)\n* John Saunders, Business man [Co-Founder Westfield Shopping Centres]\n*Big Zotyo, porn-star [\"bigdick\", pornstar]\n\n== Nationalities ==\n* Hungarian 90.91%\n* Gypsy 6.37%\n* Slovakian 1.21%\n* German 0.96%\n* Other 0.55%\n\n== Twin Towns - Sister Cities ==\nS\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{|cellpadding=\"10\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*{{flagicon|FIN}} [[Lohja]] in [[Finland]] <small>''(since 1990)''</small>\n*{{flagicon|NED}} [[Franeker]] in [[Netherlands]] <small>''(since 1991)''</small>\n*{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Sindos]] in [[Greece]] <small>''(since 2000)''</small>\n||\n||\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Krosno]] in [[Poland]] <small>''(since 2006)'' <ref name=\"Twin\">''{{cite web|url=http://www.krosno.pl/?node=30|title=Krosno Official Website - Partner Cities|publisher=[[File:Flag of Poland.svg|border|8px]]{{fontcolor|Green|(in}} [[Polish language|{{fontcolor|Green|Polish}}]]) [[copyright|\u00a9]] 1998 - 2001 Urz\u0105d Miasta Krosna.|accessdate=2008-10-23}}''</ref></small>\n*{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Michalovce]] in [[Slovakia]]\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], [[Ujhel-Siget (Hasidic dynasty)|Ujhel-Siget]] [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Hungary]]\n{{See also|\u00fajhely}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{JewishEncyclopedia}} ([http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=5&letter=U]) (by [[Gotthard Deutsch]], [[Ludwig Venetianer]])\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely}}\n{{Wikivoyage|S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.satoraljaujhely.hu/}} in Hungarian\n\n{{S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely District}}\n{{Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County}}\n\n{{Coord|48|24|N|21|40|E|region:HU_type:city|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Satoraljaujhely}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County]]\n[[Category:Divided cities]]\n[[Category:Shtetls]]\n[[Category:Jewish communities in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Hungary]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1toralja%C3%BAjhely"}
