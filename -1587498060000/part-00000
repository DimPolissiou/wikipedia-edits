By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator <ref name = \"Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education\">Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.</ref>  A health educator is \"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below. The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced \"a new hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchec.org/news/posts/hespa2|title=Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis II 2020 Validates and Reveals Eight Areas of Responsibility for Health Education Specialists|website=www.nchec.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>.\n\n==Motivation==\nEducation for health begins with people. It hopes to motivate them with whatever interests they may have in improving their [[living conditions]]. Its aim come is to develop in them a sense of responsibility for health conditions for themselves as individuals, as members of families, and as communities. In communicable disease control, health education commonly includes an appraisal of what is known by a population about a disease, an assessment of habits and attitudes of the people as they relate to spread and frequency of the disease, and the presentation of specific means to remedy observed deficiencies.<ref>[http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm Washington State Department of Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107002810/http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm |date=2010-01-07 }}</ref>\n\nHealth education is also an effective tool that helps improve health in developing nations. It not only teaches prevention and basic health knowledge but also conditions ideas that re-shape everyday habits of people with unhealthy lifestyles in developing countries. This type of conditioning not only affects the immediate recipients of such education but also future generations will benefit from an improved and properly cultivated ideas about health that will eventually be ingrained with widely spread health education. Moreover, besides physical health prevention, health education can also provide more aid and help people deal healthier with situations of extreme stress, anxiety, depression or other emotional disturbances to lessen the impact of these sorts of mental and emotional constituents, which can consequently lead to detrimental physical effects.,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bundy D. |author2=Guya H.L. | year = 1996 | title = Schools for health, education and the school-age child | url = | journal = Parasitology Today | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 1\u201316 | doi=10.1016/0169-4758(96)30011-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kann L. |author2=Brener N.D. |author3=Allensworth D.D. | year = 2001 | title = Health education: Results from the School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000 | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 71 | issue = 7| pages = 266\u2013278 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2001.tb03504.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.307.2181 | pmid = 11822302 }}</ref>\n\n==Credentialing==\n\nCredentialing is the process by which the qualifications of licensed professionals, organizational members or an organization are determined by assessing the individuals or group background and legitimacy through a standardized process. Accreditation, licensure, or certifications are all forms of credentialing.\n\nIn 1978, Helen Cleary, the president of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE) started the process of certification of health educators. Prior to this, there was no certification for individual health educators, with exception to the licensing for school health educators.  The only accreditation available in this field was for school health and public health professional preparation programs.\n\nHer initial response was to incorporate experts in the field and to promote funding for the process. The director if the Division of Associated Health Professions in the Bureau of Health Manpower of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Thomas Hatch, became interested in the project. To ensure that the commonalities between health educators across the spectrum of professions would be sufficient enough to create a set of standards, Dr. Cleary spent a great amount of time to create the first conference called the Bethesda Conference. In attendance were interested professionals who covered the possibility of creating credentialing within the profession.\n\nWith the success of the conference and the consensus that the standardization of the profession was vital, those who organized the conference created the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators. Funding for this endeavor became available in January 1979, and role delineation became a realistic vision for the future.  They presented the framework for the system in 1981 and published entry-level criteria in 1983. Seven areas of responsibility, 29 areas of competency and 79 sub-competencies were required of health education professionals for approximately 20 years for entry-level educators.\n\nIn 1986 a second conference was held in Bethesda, Maryland to further the credentialing process. In June 1988, the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators became the [[National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC)]]. Their mission was to improve development of the field by promoting, preparing and certifying health education specialists. The NCHEC has three division boards that included preparation, professional development and certification of health educator professionals. The third board, which is called the Division Board of Certification of Health Education Specialist (DBCHES), has the responsibility of developing and administering the CHES\u00ae exam. An initial certification process allowed 1,558 individuals to be chartered into the program through a recommendation and application process. The first exam was given in 1990.\n\nIn order for a candidate to sit for an exam they must have either a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree from an accredited institution, and an official transcript that shows a major in health education, Community Health Education, Public Health Education, or [[school health education|School Health Education]], etc. The transcript will be accepted if it reflects 25 semester hours or 37 quarter hours in health education preparation and covers the 7 responsibilities covered in the framework.\n\nIn 1998 a project called the Competencies Update Project (CUP) began. The purpose of the CUP project was to up-date entry-level requirements and to develop advanced-level competences. Through research the CUP project created the requirements for three levels, which included entry-level, Advanced I and Advanced II educators.<ref>Cottrell, R. R., Girvan, J. T., & McKenzie, J. F. (2009). Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education. New York: Benjamin Cummings.</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patterson S. M. |author2=Vitello E. M. | year = 2006 | title = Key Influences Shaping Health Education: Progress Toward Accreditation | url = | journal = The Health Education Monograph Series | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 14\u201319 }}</ref>\n\nRecently the Master Certified Health Education Specialist (MCHES\u00ae) was created. The MCHES\u00ae exam measures the knowledge of the advanced levels and sub levels of the Seven Areas of Responsibilities. The first MCHES\u00ae exam was given in October 2011.\n\nIn order to be eligible to take the MCHES\u00ae exam you must have at least a master's degree in health education or related discipline along with a least 25 credit hours related to health education.  In addition, five years of documented information of practice in health education and two recommendations of past/present supervisors must be provided. A vitae/resume must also be submitted.\n\nThe Competency Update Project (CUP), 1998-2004 revealed that there were higher levels of health education practitioners, which is the reasoning for the advancements for the MCHES\u00ae. Many health educators felt that the current CHES\u00ae credential was an entry-level exam.\n\n==Teaching==\n\nIn the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90% of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards. Retrieved May 1, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/SHER/standards/index.htm</ref>\n\n==Health Education Code of Ethics==\nThe Health Education Code of Ethics has been a work in progress since approximately 1976, begun by the Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE).  Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

These individuals play a crucial role in many organizations in various settings to improve our nations health. Just as a Community health educator works work toward population health, a school Health educator generally teaches in our Schools. A health education specialist is typically focused on their immediate community striving to serve the public.\n\n'''Health Care Settings''': these include hospitals (for-profit and public), medical care clinics, home health agencies, HMOs and PPOs. Here, a health educator teaches employees how to be healthy. [[Patient education]] positions are far and few between because insurance companies do not cover the costs.\n\n'''Public Health Agencies''': are official, tax funded, government agencies. They provide police protection, educational systems, as well as clean air and water. Public health departments provide health services and are organized by a city, county, state, or federal government.\n\n'''School Health Education''': involves all strategies, activities, and services offered by, in, or in association with schools that are designed to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development. School health involves teaching students about health and health related behaviors. Curriculum and programs are based on the school's expectations and health.\n\n'''Non-Profit Voluntary Health Agencies''': are created by concerned citizens to deal with health needs not met by governmental agencies. Missions include public education, professional education, patient education, research, direct services and support to or for people directly affected by a specific health or medical problem. Usually funded by such means as private donations, grants, and fund-raisers.\n\n'''Higher Education''': typically two types of positions health educators hold including academic, or faculty or health educator in a student health service or wellness center. As a faculty member, the health educator typically has three major responsibilities: teaching, community and professional service, and scholarly research. As a health educator in a university health service or wellness center, the major responsibility is to plan, implement, and evaluate health promotion and education programs for program participants. \n\n'''Worksite Health Promotion''': is a combination of educational, organizational and environmental activities designed to improve the health and safety of employees and their families. These work site wellness programs offer an additional setting for health educators and allow them to reach segments of the population that are not easily reached through traditional community health programs. Some work site health promotion activities include: smoking cessation, stress management, bulletin boards, newsletters, and much more.\n\n'''Independent Consulting and Government Contracting''': international, national, regional, state, and local organizations contract with independent consultants for many reasons. They may be hired to assess individual and community needs for health education; plan, implement, administer and evaluate health education strategies; conduct research; serve as health education resource person; and or communicate about and advocate for health and health education. Government contractors are often behind national health education programs, government reports, public information web sites and telephone lines, media campaigns, conferences, and health education materials. \n\n==Notable Individuals in Health Education==\n\n[[Elena Sliepcevich]] was a leading figure in the development of health education both as an academic discipline and a profession. She graduated from the University of Ireland in 1939 and received her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949. She received her doctorate in physical education from Springfield College in 1955. After completing her schooling, Elena Sliepcevich worked at Ohio State University in 1961 as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969, and most health education curricula used in schools today are based on the ten conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study. These ten areas of focus include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse.<ref>[[Elena Sliepcevich]]{{Elena Sliepcevich}}</ref>\n\n==Health Education Worldwide==\n===Romania===\nSince 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education. The National Health Education Programme in Romanian Schools was considered a priority for the intervention of the GFATM (Global Fund) and UN Agencies.\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Shokuiku]] ([[Kanji]]: \u98df\u80b2) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for \"[[food]] [[education]]\". The law defines it as the \"acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]\".\n\nIt was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.<ref>http://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046%2809%2900149-3/abstract</ref>\n\nMajor concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:\n* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.\n* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html|title=shokuiku - Buzzword - Trends in Japan - Web Japan|author=|date=|website=web-japan.org}}</ref>\n* Families not eating meals together.\n\nClasses in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.<ref>Mark Frank. \"[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006150011/en Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project]\".

By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator <ref name = \"Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education\">Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.</ref>  A health educator is \"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below. The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced \"a new hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchec.org/news/posts/hespa2|title=Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis II 2020 Validates and Reveals Eight Areas of Responsibility for Health Education Specialists|website=www.nchec.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>.\n\n==Motivation==\nEducation for health begins with people. It hopes to motivate them with whatever interests they may have in improving their [[living conditions]]. Its aim come is to develop in them a sense of responsibility for health conditions for themselves as individuals, as members of families, and as communities. In communicable disease control, health education commonly includes an appraisal of what is known by a population about a disease, an assessment of habits and attitudes of the people as they relate to spread and frequency of the disease, and the presentation of specific means to remedy observed deficiencies.<ref>[http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm Washington State Department of Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107002810/http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm |date=2010-01-07 }}</ref>\n\nHealth education is also an effective tool that helps improve health in developing nations. It not only teaches prevention and basic health knowledge but also conditions ideas that re-shape everyday habits of people with unhealthy lifestyles in developing countries. This type of conditioning not only affects the immediate recipients of such education but also future generations will benefit from an improved and properly cultivated ideas about health that will eventually be ingrained with widely spread health education. Moreover, besides physical health prevention, health education can also provide more aid and help people deal healthier with situations of extreme stress, anxiety, depression or other emotional disturbances to lessen the impact of these sorts of mental and emotional constituents, which can consequently lead to detrimental physical effects.,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bundy D. |author2=Guya H.L. | year = 1996 | title = Schools for health, education and the school-age child | url = | journal = Parasitology Today | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 1\u201316 | doi=10.1016/0169-4758(96)30011-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kann L. |author2=Brener N.D. |author3=Allensworth D.D. | year = 2001 | title = Health education: Results from the School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000 | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 71 | issue = 7| pages = 266\u2013278 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2001.tb03504.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.307.2181 | pmid = 11822302 }}</ref>\n\n==Credentialing==\n\nCredentialing is the process by which the qualifications of licensed professionals, organizational members or an organization are determined by assessing the individuals or group background and legitimacy through a standardized process. Accreditation, licensure, or certifications are all forms of credentialing.\n\nIn 1978, Helen Cleary, the president of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE) started the process of certification of health educators. Prior to this, there was no certification for individual health educators, with exception to the licensing for school health educators.  The only accreditation available in this field was for school health and public health professional preparation programs.\n\nHer initial response was to incorporate experts in the field and to promote funding for the process. The director if the Division of Associated Health Professions in the Bureau of Health Manpower of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Thomas Hatch, became interested in the project. To ensure that the commonalities between health educators across the spectrum of professions would be sufficient enough to create a set of standards, Dr. Cleary spent a great amount of time to create the first conference called the Bethesda Conference. In attendance were interested professionals who covered the possibility of creating credentialing within the profession.\n\nWith the success of the conference and the consensus that the standardization of the profession was vital, those who organized the conference created the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators. Funding for this endeavor became available in January 1979, and role delineation became a realistic vision for the future.  They presented the framework for the system in 1981 and published entry-level criteria in 1983. Seven areas of responsibility, 29 areas of competency and 79 sub-competencies were required of health education professionals for approximately 20 years for entry-level educators.\n\nIn 1986 a second conference was held in Bethesda, Maryland to further the credentialing process. In June 1988, the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators became the [[National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC)]]. Their mission was to improve development of the field by promoting, preparing and certifying health education specialists. The NCHEC has three division boards that included preparation, professional development and certification of health educator professionals. The third board, which is called the Division Board of Certification of Health Education Specialist (DBCHES), has the responsibility of developing and administering the CHES\u00ae exam. An initial certification process allowed 1,558 individuals to be chartered into the program through a recommendation and application process. The first exam was given in 1990.\n\nIn order for a candidate to sit for an exam they must have either a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree from an accredited institution, and an official transcript that shows a major in health education, Community Health Education, Public Health Education, or [[school health education|School Health Education]], etc. The transcript will be accepted if it reflects 25 semester hours or 37 quarter hours in health education preparation and covers the 7 responsibilities covered in the framework.\n\nIn 1998 a project called the Competencies Update Project (CUP) began. The purpose of the CUP project was to up-date entry-level requirements and to develop advanced-level competences. Through research the CUP project created the requirements for three levels, which included entry-level, Advanced I and Advanced II educators.<ref>Cottrell, R. R., Girvan, J. T., & McKenzie, J. F. (2009). Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education. New York: Benjamin Cummings.</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patterson S. M. |author2=Vitello E. M. | year = 2006 | title = Key Influences Shaping Health Education: Progress Toward Accreditation | url = | journal = The Health Education Monograph Series | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 14\u201319 }}</ref>\n\nRecently the Master Certified Health Education Specialist (MCHES\u00ae) was created. The MCHES\u00ae exam measures the knowledge of the advanced levels and sub levels of the Seven Areas of Responsibilities. The first MCHES\u00ae exam was given in October 2011.\n\nIn order to be eligible to take the MCHES\u00ae exam you must have at least a master's degree in health education or related discipline along with a least 25 credit hours related to health education.  In addition, five years of documented information of practice in health education and two recommendations of past/present supervisors must be provided. A vitae/resume must also be submitted.\n\nThe Competency Update Project (CUP), 1998-2004 revealed that there were higher levels of health education practitioners, which is the reasoning for the advancements for the MCHES\u00ae. Many health educators felt that the current CHES\u00ae credential was an entry-level exam.\n\n==Teaching==\n\nIn the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90% of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards. Retrieved May 1, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/SHER/standards/index.htm</ref>\n\n==Health Education Code of Ethics==\nThe Health Education Code of Ethics has been a work in progress since approximately 1976, begun by the Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE).  Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

These individuals play a crucial role in many organizations in various settings to improve our nations health. Just as a Community health educator works work toward population health, a school Health educator generally teaches in our Schools. A health education specialist is typically focused on their immediate community striving to serve the public.\n\n'''Health Care Settings''': these include hospitals (for-profit and public), medical care clinics, home health agencies, HMOs and PPOs. Here, a health educator teaches employees how to be healthy. [[Patient education]] positions are far and few between because insurance companies do not cover the costs.\n\n'''Public Health Agencies''': are official, tax funded, government agencies. They provide police protection, educational systems, as well as clean air and water. Public health departments provide health services and are organized by a city, county, state, or federal government.\n\n'''School Health Education''': involves all strategies, activities, and services offered by, in, or in association with schools that are designed to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development. School health involves teaching students about health and health related behaviors. Curriculum and programs are based on the school's expectations and health.\n\n'''Non-Profit Voluntary Health Agencies''': are created by concerned citizens to deal with health needs not met by governmental agencies. Missions include public education, professional education, patient education, research, direct services and support to or for people directly affected by a specific health or medical problem. Usually funded by such means as private donations, grants, and fund-raisers.\n\n'''Higher Education''': typically two types of positions health educators hold including academic, or faculty or health educator in a student health service or wellness center. As a faculty member, the health educator typically has three major responsibilities: teaching, community and professional service, and scholarly research. As a health educator in a university health service or wellness center, the major responsibility is to plan, implement, and evaluate health promotion and education programs for program participants. \n\n'''Worksite Health Promotion''': is a combination of educational, organizational and environmental activities designed to improve the health and safety of employees and their families. These work site wellness programs offer an additional setting for health educators and allow them to reach segments of the population that are not easily reached through traditional community health programs. Some work site health promotion activities include: smoking cessation, stress management, bulletin boards, newsletters, and much more.\n\n'''Independent Consulting and Government Contracting''': international, national, regional, state, and local organizations contract with independent consultants for many reasons. They may be hired to assess individual and community needs for health education; plan, implement, administer and evaluate health education strategies; conduct research; serve as health education resource person; and or communicate about and advocate for health and health education. Government contractors are often behind national health education programs, government reports, public information web sites and telephone lines, media campaigns, conferences, and health education materials. \n\n==Notable Individuals in Health Education==\n\n[[Elena Sliepcevich]] was a leading figure in the development of health education both as an academic discipline and a profession. She graduated from the University of Ireland in 1939 and received her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949. She received her doctorate in physical education from Springfield College in 1955. After completing her schooling, Elena Sliepcevich worked at Ohio State University in 1961 as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969, and most health education curricula used in schools today are based on the ten conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study. These ten areas of focus include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse.<ref>[[Elena Sliepcevich]]{{Elena Sliepcevich}}</ref>\n\n==Health Education Worldwide==\n===Romania===\nSince 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education. The National Health Education Programme in Romanian Schools was considered a priority for the intervention of the GFATM (Global Fund) and UN Agencies.\n\n===Japan===\n\n[[Shokuiku]] ([[Kanji]]: \u98df\u80b2) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for \"[[food]] [[education]]\". The law defines it as the \"acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]\".\n\nIt was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.<ref>http://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046%2809%2900149-3/abstract</ref>\n\nMajor concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:\n* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.\n* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html|title=shokuiku - Buzzword - Trends in Japan - Web Japan|author=|date=|website=web-japan.org}}</ref>\n* Families not eating meals together.\n\nClasses in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.<ref>Mark Frank. \"[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006150011/en Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project]\". ''Bulletin of Keiwa College'' 15 (2006).</ref>\n\n=== Poland ===\nHealth education in Poland is not mandatory, but research has shown that even with implantation of health education that the adolescents of Poland were still not choosing to live a healthy lifestyle. Health education is still needed in Poland, but the factor of what is actually available, especially in rural areas, and what is affordable affects the decisions more than what is healthy.\n\n=== Taiwan ===\n\nHealth education in [[Taiwan]] focuses on multiple topics, including: <ref name=\"Taiwan Health Promoting Schools\">{{cite web|title=Taiwan Health Promoting Schools|url=http://hpshome.giee.ntnu.edu.tw/en/index.html|website=Taiwan Health Promoting Schools|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125114011/http://hpshome.giee.ntnu.edu.tw/en/index.html|archivedate=2014-11-25}}</ref>\n\n*Education for student to enhance their health status\n*Assists parents to use health resources and health education information\n*Teach students to understand specific diseases and basic medical knowledge\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Dorothy Nyswander]]\n* [[Environmental Health]]\n* [[Health literacy]]\n* [[Health marketing]]\n* [[Health promotion]]\n* [[Healthy People 2010]]\n* [[Online health communities]]\n* [[Personal, Social and Health Education]]\n* [[Physical Education]]\n* [[Public health|Public Health]]\n* [[School Health Education Study]]\n* [[skill|Health skills]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Books==\n*Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is \"[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]\".)<ref name=Kohler1923/> --> Similarly the [[Vulgate]] renders \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc in [[Latin]] as ''Lucifer'', the name in that language for the morning star. According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12\u201317|NIV}}</ref>}}\n\nJ. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man, and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.<ref name=Laney/><ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}</ref>\n\nFor the unnamed<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 |title=Isaiah: God's Poet of Light |author=Carol J.

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is \"[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]\".)<ref name=Kohler1923/> --> Similarly the [[Vulgate]] renders \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc in [[Latin]] as ''Lucifer'', the name in that language for the morning star. According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12\u201317|NIV}}</ref>}}\n\nJ. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man, and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.<ref name=Laney/><ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}</ref>\n\nFor the unnamed<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 |title=Isaiah: God's Poet of Light |author=Carol J.

Most of the fighting during the war took place on, or in the waters around, the island of [[Sicily]] and in 241 BC the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|defeated a Carthaginian fleet]] attempting to lift the [[blockade]] of its last strongholds there. Accepting defeat, the Carthaginian Senate ordered their army commander on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]], to agree a [[peace treaty]] with the Romans, on whatever terms he could negotiate. Hamilcar refused, claiming the surrender was unnecessary, and the negotiation of the peace terms was left to [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]], the commander of Lilybaeum, as the next most senior Carthaginian on the island. A draft treaty was rapidly agreed, but when this was referred to Rome for ratification it was rejected. A commission of ten was sent to sent to settle the matter. This in turn agreed that Carthage would hand over what it still held of Sicily; relinquish several groups of islands near nearby; release all Roman prisoners without ransom, although ransom would need to be paid to secure the release of prisoners held by the Romans; and pay an indemnity of 3,200 talents of silver{{snd}}{{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in|lk=out}}{{snd}} over 10 years. It received its name from the victorious Gaius Lutatius Catulus, who also negotiated the initial draft.\n\nIn 237 BC, when Carthage was recovering from a bitter and hard fought civil war, it prepared an expedition to recover the island of [[Sardinia]], which had been lost to rebels. Cynically, the Romans stated they considered this an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and [[Corsica]] and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity. Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again and the renunciation of Sardinia and Corsica, and the additional payment were added to the treaty.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|[[Polybius]]{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the treaty in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war and the treaty that ended it exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} The 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[chronicler]] [[Joannes Zonaras]], who relied on much earlier sources, is also sometimes used.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=41\u201345}}{{sfn|Mineo|2015|p=126}}\n\n== First Punic War ==\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] had been [[Roman expansion in Italy|aggressively expanding]] in the southern Italian mainland for a century before the First Punic War.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=157\u2013158}} It had conquered peninsular Italy south of the River [[Arno]] by 272 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=21\u201322}} During this period [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], with its capital in what is now [[Tunisia]], had come to dominate southern [[Spain]], much of the coastal regions of [[North Africa]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the western half of [[Sicily]] in a military and commercial empire.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=29\u201330}} In 264 BC Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25\u201326}} The two states had several times asserted their mutual friendship via [[Treaties between Rome and Carthage|formal alliances]]: in 509 BC, 348 BC and around 279 BC. Relationships were good, with strong commercial links.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=94, 160, 163, 164\u2013165}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC the two cities went to war over the city of Messana (modern [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]) in the north-eastern tip of Sicily.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=165}} Many members of the Roman elite saw strategic and monetary advantages in gaining a foothold in Sicily. The deadlocked [[Roman Senate]] put the matter before the [[Legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic|popular assembly]], which decided on war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=42\u201345}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=150}} Carthaginian leaders expected their overwhelming [[Command of the sea|maritime superiority]] would allow the war to be kept at a distance, and even for them to continue to prosper. Their experience over the previous two centuries of warfare on Sicily was that decisive action was impossible; military efforts petered out after heavy losses and huge expense.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} The Carthaginians were defeated in several large naval battles; shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, only to lose another 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of [[Lilybaeum]] with 200 warships.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nThe Carthaginians broke the blockade in 249 BC with victories at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=163}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=122}} The war had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome was the stronger land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the [[Numidians]], and probably viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=94}}\n\nThe Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} When [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}} After more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-[[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Senate decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 large warships, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet under [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} After achieving this decisive victory, the Romans continued their land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum and Drepana.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\n== Treaty ==\n[[File:Q. Lutatius Cerco, denarius, 109-108 BC, RRC 305-1 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.5|alt=An ancient coin depicting a galley surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves|{{center|A Roman coin from 109 BC alluding to Catalus's victory; it shows a galley within a wreath of oak leaves{{sfn|Crawford|1974|p=315}}]]\n\nWith their relief effort defeated, the Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned. In any case, it was probable their Carthaginian garrisons would be starved into surrender before that could be done.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Instead, it ordered Hamilcar to agree a [[peace treaty]] with the Romans, on whatever terms he could negotiate. After receiving the order to make peace, Hamilcar refused, claiming the surrender was unnecessary; it is possible that for political and prestige reasons Hamilcar did not wish to be associated with the treaty which formalised Carthage's defeat in the 23-year-long war. As the next most senior Carthaginian on the island, it was left to Gisco, the commander of Lilybaeum, to negotiate the peace terms.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}\n\nThe senior Roman commander on Sicily was the recently victorious [[Roman consul|consul]] Catulus, and Gisco opened discussions with him. Consuls usually served for a twelve-month term, and Lutatius's initial term in 242 BC had, unusually, been extended for a year. He was keen to conclude a definitive peace and thus claim the credit for bringing the lengthy war to a close.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=128}} The two men agreed that Carthage would hand over what it still held of Sicily; release all Roman prisoners without ransom, although ransom would need to be paid to secure the release of prisoners held by the Romans; and pay an indemnity of 2,200 talents of silver{{snd}}{{convert|56|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=on}}{{snd}} over 20 years. These terms were referred to Rome for ratification, where they were rejected. A commission of ten was sent to sent to settle the matter. As the commission was chaired by Catulus's brother [[Quintus Lutatius Cerco]], who was to succeed him as consul, this may have been largely a negotiating ploy.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=157\u2013158}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=128\u2013129}} Some historians argue that there was a faction in Rome opposed to the treaty, and possibly to ending the war at all, which was led by the ex-consul [[Aulus Manlius Torquatus Atticus]]. This possible disagreement within Roman policy makers was exemplified by Atticus being elected consul again in 241 BC alongside Cerco.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=41\u201345}}{{sfn|Wardle|2005|pp=382\u2013384}}\n\nGisco rapidly agreed to further concessions with the commission: several islands close to Sicily would also be handed over;{{#tag:ref|Probably the [[Aeolian Islands|Lipari]] and [[Aegadian Islands|Aegades Islands]] and [[Ustica]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} the indemnity was increased to 3,200 talents,{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} with the additional 1,000 talents payable immediately and the time allowed to pay the balance reduced to 10 years. There were other minor clauses in the final agreement, which was formalised in the Treaty of Lutatius, named after Catulus.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=157\u2013158}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=128\u2013129}} Hamilcar immediately handed over command on Sicily to Gisco, and was left with formally informing Carthage of what had been agreed.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n===Sardinia and Corsica===\n\nAfter Carthage evacuated its 20,000 strong army from Sicily to North Africa it became embroiled with the troops in a pay dispute. Eventually the troops [[Mutiny|mutinied]] and turned against Carthage. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion; some were freshly conquered and all had been harshly oppressed to finance the recently ended war. They added 70,000 men to the rebel force and supplied finance and food. Rome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles and adhered to the terms of the recent treaty. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman [[Satellite state|satellite]] kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on Sardinia joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}\n\n[[File:Map of Rome and Carthage at the start of the Second Punic War-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the Second Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[Second Punic War]]}}]]\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and Corsica.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}} It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}} Polybius held that this action was indefensible.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}} Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The Roman Senate cynically stated they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=175}} The renunciation of Sardinia, which was understood to include Corsica, and the additional payment were added to the treaty.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=124}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nFor Rome, the treaty marked the start of its expansion beyond the Italian Peninsula. Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. Carthage was not reconciled to this situation, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Bringmann|first=Klaus|title=A History of the Roman Republic|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|publisher=Polity Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-3370-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftlpza5l9R4C|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |url={{Google Books|sDpMh0gK2OUC|plainurl=y}} |title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World |first=Lionel|last= Casson  |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8018-5130-8|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|editor1-last=Hoyos\n|editor1-first=Dexter\n|first=Craige B. \n|last=Champion\n|chapter=Polybius and the Punic Wars\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|pages=95\u2013110\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Crawford\n|first=Michael\n|date=1974\n|title=Roman Republican Coinage\n|url=\n|location=Cambridge\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|oclc=859598398\n|isbn=\n|author-link=Michael Crawford (historian)\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

Most of the fighting during the war took place on, or in the waters around, the island of [[Sicily]] and in 241 BC the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|defeated a Carthaginian fleet]] attempting to lift the [[blockade]] of its last strongholds there. Accepting defeat, the Carthaginian Senate ordered their army commander on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]], to agree a [[peace treaty]] with the Romans, on whatever terms he could negotiate. Hamilcar refused, claiming the surrender was unnecessary, and the negotiation of the peace terms was left to [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]], the commander of Lilybaeum, as the next most senior Carthaginian on the island. A draft treaty was rapidly agreed, but when this was referred to Rome for ratification it was rejected. A commission of ten was sent to sent to settle the matter. This in turn agreed that Carthage would hand over what it still held of Sicily; relinquish several groups of islands near nearby; release all Roman prisoners without ransom, although ransom would need to be paid to secure the release of prisoners held by the Romans; and pay an indemnity of 3,200 talents of silver{{snd}}{{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in|lk=out}}{{snd}} over 10 years. It received its name from the victorious Gaius Lutatius Catulus, who also negotiated the initial draft.\n\nIn 237 BC, when Carthage was recovering from a bitter and hard fought civil war, it prepared an expedition to recover the island of [[Sardinia]], which had been lost to rebels. Cynically, the Romans stated they considered this an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and [[Corsica]] and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity. Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again and the renunciation of Sardinia and Corsica, and the additional payment were added to the treaty.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|[[Polybius]]{{snd}}\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}}}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the treaty in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war and the treaty that ended it exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} The 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[chronicler]] [[Joannes Zonaras]], who relied on much earlier sources, is also sometimes used.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=41\u201345}}{{sfn|Mineo|2015|p=126}}\n\n== First Punic War ==\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] had been [[Roman expansion in Italy|aggressively expanding]] in the southern Italian mainland for a century before the First Punic War.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=157\u2013158}} It had conquered peninsular Italy south of the River [[Arno]] by 272 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=21\u201322}} During this period [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], with its capital in what is now [[Tunisia]], had come to dominate southern [[Spain]], much of the coastal regions of [[North Africa]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the western half of [[Sicily]] in a military and commercial empire.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=29\u201330}} In 264 BC Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25\u201326}} The two states had several times asserted their mutual friendship via [[Treaties between Rome and Carthage|formal alliances]]: in 509 BC, 348 BC and around 279 BC.

Their experience over the previous two centuries of warfare on Sicily was that decisive action was impossible; military efforts petered out after heavy losses and huge expense.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} The Carthaginians were defeated in several large naval battles; shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, only to lose another 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC.

Rome was the stronger land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the [[Numidians]], and probably viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=94}}\n\nThe Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} When [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}} After more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-[[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Senate decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 large warships, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet under [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} After achieving this decisive victory, the Romans continued their land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum and Drepana.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\n== Treaty ==\n[[File:Q.

In any case, it was probable their Carthaginian garrisons would be starved into surrender before that could be done.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Instead, it ordered Hamilcar to agree a [[peace treaty]] with the Romans, on whatever terms he could negotiate. After receiving the order to make peace, Hamilcar refused, claiming the surrender was unnecessary; it is possible that for political and prestige reasons Hamilcar did not wish to be associated with the treaty which formalised Carthage's defeat in the 23-year-long war. As the next most senior Carthaginian on the island, it was left to Gisco, the commander of Lilybaeum, to negotiate the peace terms.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}\n\nThe senior Roman commander on Sicily was the recently victorious [[Roman consul|consul]] Catulus, and Gisco opened discussions with him. Consuls usually served for a twelve-month term, and Lutatius's initial term in 242 BC had, unusually, been extended for a year. He was keen to conclude a definitive peace and thus claim the credit for bringing the lengthy war to a close.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=128}} The two men agreed that Carthage would hand over what it still held of Sicily; release all Roman prisoners without ransom, although ransom would need to be paid to secure the release of prisoners held by the Romans; and pay an indemnity of 2,200 talents of silver{{snd}}{{convert|56|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=on}}{{snd}} over 20 years. These terms were referred to Rome for ratification, where they were rejected. A commission of ten was sent to sent to settle the matter. As the commission was chaired by Catulus's brother [[Quintus Lutatius Cerco]], who was to succeed him as consul, this may have been largely a negotiating ploy.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=157\u2013158}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=128\u2013129}} Some historians argue that there was a faction in Rome opposed to the treaty, and possibly to ending the war at all, which was led by the ex-consul [[Aulus Manlius Torquatus Atticus]].

The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion; some were freshly conquered and all had been harshly oppressed to finance the recently ended war. They added 70,000 men to the rebel force and supplied finance and food. Rome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles and adhered to the terms of the recent treaty. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman [[Satellite state|satellite]] kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on Sardinia joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island.

Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. Carthage was not reconciled to this situation, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Bringmann|first=Klaus|title=A History of the Roman Republic|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|publisher=Polity Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-3370-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftlpza5l9R4C|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |url={{Google Books|sDpMh0gK2OUC|plainurl=y}} |title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World |first=Lionel|last= Casson  |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8018-5130-8|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|editor1-last=Hoyos\n|editor1-first=Dexter\n|first=Craige B. \n|last=Champion\n|chapter=Polybius and the Punic Wars\n|date=2015\n|orig-year=2011\n|title=A Companion to the Punic Wars\n|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UzJ3BwAAQBAJ\n|location=Chichester, West Sussex\n|publisher=John Wiley\n|pages=95\u2013110\n|isbn=978-1-1190-2550-4\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Crawford\n|first=Michael\n|date=1974\n|title=Roman Republican Coinage\n|url=\n|location=Cambridge\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|oclc=859598398\n|isbn=\n|author-link=Michael Crawford (historian)\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

By extension, it may refer to a decline in [[art]], [[literature]], [[science]], [[technology]], and [[workforce productivity|work ethics]], or (very loosely) to [[libertinism|self-indulgent]] behavior.\n\nUsage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(d\u0113cadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.\n\nIn literature, the [[Decadent movement]]\u2014late nineteenth century ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]\u2014was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n\n==History==\n===Decadent movement===\n{{Main|Decadent movement}}\n[[File:F\u00e9licien Rops - Pornokrat\u00e8s - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[F\u00e9licien Rops]] (1878)]]\nDecadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' na\u00efve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].\n\nThis concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal \"progress.\" In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[\u00c0 rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.\n\nIn Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include [[Arthur Symons]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and [[Ernest Dowson]].\n\nThe Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as \"decadent\" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Mor\u00e9as]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.\n\n===1920s Berlin===\n{{main|1920s Berlin}}\n{{see also|Roaring twenties}}\n\nThis \"''fertile culture''\" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919\u201333), a variety of literature ([[Alfred D\u00f6blin|D\u00f6blin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.<ref>Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''</ref>\n\n[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. \"[[Talkies]]\", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.\n\nBerlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.\n\n==Use in Marxism==\n===Leninism===\nAccording to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[Socialism|socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.<ref name=libcom>[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.</ref>\n\nOne who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the \"[[mass man]]\" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Mora, Jos\u00e9 Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes & Bowes. p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Left communism===\nDecadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.<ref>Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.</ref>\n\nContemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of.

By extension, it may refer to a decline in [[art]], [[literature]], [[science]], [[technology]], and [[workforce productivity|work ethics]], or (very loosely) to [[libertinism|self-indulgent]] behavior.\n\nUsage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(d\u0113cadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.\n\nIn literature, the [[Decadent movement]]\u2014late nineteenth century ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]\u2014was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n\n==History==\n===Decadent movement===\n{{Main|Decadent movement}}\n[[File:F\u00e9licien Rops - Pornokrat\u00e8s - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[F\u00e9licien Rops]] (1878)]]\nDecadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' na\u00efve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].\n\nThis concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal \"progress.\" In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[\u00c0 rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.\n\nIn Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include [[Arthur Symons]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and [[Ernest Dowson]].\n\nThe Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as \"decadent\" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Mor\u00e9as]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.\n\n===1920s Berlin===\n{{main|1920s Berlin}}\n{{see also|Roaring twenties}}\n\nThis \"''fertile culture''\" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919\u201333), a variety of literature ([[Alfred D\u00f6blin|D\u00f6blin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.<ref>Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''</ref>\n\n[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. \"[[Talkies]]\", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.\n\nBerlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.\n\n==Use in Marxism==\n===Leninism===\nAccording to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[Socialism|socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.<ref name=libcom>[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.</ref>\n\nOne who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the \"[[mass man]]\" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Mora, Jos\u00e9 Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes & Bowes. p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Left communism===\nDecadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.<ref>Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.</ref>\n\nContemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acedia]]\n* [[Anomie]]\n* [[Bread and Circuses]]\n* [[Competence (human resources)]]\n* [[Buraiha]]\n* [[Kleptocracy]]\n* [[Late capitalism]]\n* [[Moral relativism]]\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n* [[Twilight of the Idols]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Richard Gilman, ''Decadence: The Strange Life of an Epithet'' (1979). {{ISBN|0-374-13567-3}}\n* Matei Calinescu, ''Five Faces of Modernity''. {{ISBN|0-8223-0767-7}}\n* [[Mario Praz]], ''The Romantic Agony'' (1930). {{ISBN|0-19-281061-8}}\n* [[Jacques Barzun]], ''From Dawn to Decadence'', (2000). {{ISBN|0-06-017586-9}}\n* A.

King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered an invasion of Algiers led by [[Alexander O'Reilly]], who commanded a combined military and naval expedition of nearly fifty ships and more than twenty thousand troops. The assault was a spectacular failure and the campaign proved a humiliating blow to the Spanish military revival.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the Spanish had broken the Moroccan [[Siege of Melilla (1774)|siege of Melilla]] in 1774 Charles's government decided to send a military and naval expedition off the North African coast, as he was determined to demonstrate to the Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Mohammed III]] that Spain would not waver in its resolve to hold onto its Moroccan enclaves. The Spanish objective was to occupy Algiers; a key and supposedly vulnerable Barbary port. The expedition was commanded by Alexander O'Reilly, an Irish officer who at a young age had entered Spanish military service. As head of the royal household guard in 1765, he had protected Charles III from a deadly assault and had crushed the rebellion by French settlers in the [[Louisiana Rebellion of 1768]] after the territory had been [[History of Louisiana#Spanish interregnum (1763\u20131803)|transferred from France to Spain]] in 1763. In command of the naval task force was [[Pedro Gonzalez de Castejon]] with and together they organized a task force by late spring.<ref>Powell pg 886</ref>\n\n==Assault==\n[[File:Alejandro O'Reilly by Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait of Alejandro O'Reilly by [[Francisco de Goya]].]]\nBy June the task force was enormous, with seven ships of the line, including ''San Francisco de Paula'', ''Oriente'', ''San Rafael'', ''Diligente'' and ''San Jos\u00e9'', as well as twelve frigates, 27 gun boats, five hulks, nine feluccas, four mortar boats, seven galleys and three other vessels, along with 230 transports. 20,000 soldiers, sailors and marines completed the complement and it set course from [[Cartagena, Spain]] for the Bay of Algiers, reaching its destination by the beginning of July.<ref>Jaques p. 34</ref>\n\nThe Spanish troops landed in two waves, but were overwhelmed by the sweltering summer heat. [[Antonio Barcel\u00f3]] protected the [[landing craft]] as they approached but with the bays shallow water he stuck to the coast as close as possible so that the naval artillery was more effective. Despite the strict instruction that O'Reilly instilled in his troops, the Spanish mistakenly chose the landing area and the heavy guns were stuck fast in the dunes of the beach making them totally unusable for combat. Once ashore however the Spanish were met initially with light resistance mainly because a feigned retreat by the forces from Algiers. The latter had been massively augmented by warrior tribesmen from the interior, who had been alerted by intelligence from Berber merchants in Marseilles who had followed the course of Spanish military preparations during the spring.<ref>Powell p. 886</ref>\n\n[[File:Sirjohnacton.jpg|thumb|180px|Portrait of Sir John Acton, attributed to Emanuele Napoli.]]\nBy now the Spanish had realized the position they were in and the trap was set by the Algerines. Once the Spanish had realised they were surrounded it was too late.<ref>Houtsma p. 259</ref> Unable to hold a line of resistance, the Spanish forces were routed, returning in chaos to their ships. The losses were huge; nearly 3,000 casualties, including five generals killed and fifteen wounded (one of these being [[Bernado de Galvez]]) and then abandoning to the Algerians no fewer than 15 guns and some 9000 other weapons.<ref>Wolf p. 322</ref> [[Henry Swinburne]] records that the Spanish would have been \"broken and slaughtered to a man... had not Mr. Acton, the Tuscan commander, cut his cables, and let his ships drive in to shore just as the enemy was coming on us full gallop. The incessant fire of his great guns, loaded with grape-shot, not only stopt them in their career, but obliged them to retire with great loss\".<ref>Travels through Spain, in the years 1775 and 1776, Volume 1, Pages 61-62, By Henry Swinburne, Published 1787</ref> The Spanish had lost many prisoners as many were cut off from returning to their ships. O'Reilly had to wait for a month to negotiate their return. He then wanted to retaliate by bombarding Algiers from the sea, but he learned that he had only enough provisions on board to last for an immediate return to Spain. O'Reilly and the Spanish fleet withdrew to [[Alicante]] with his reputation now in tatters.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough in general Charles III's reforms of the Spanish military would enhance his country's military position, O'Reilly's poor preparations and leadership made the Algiers defeat a mockery of the Spanish army. While the Algerines had detailed intelligence on the Spanish, the Spaniards had no information about them. Where Spain had mostly raw recruits, the Algerians had veteran warriors. The Algerians confronted the Spanish with a united force, whereas O'Reilly and the commander of the Spanish ships had many differences in particular between the navy and the army. This bitterness resulted in an extraordinary lack of planning, which in turn left O'Reilly with inadequate provisions and armaments. O'Reilly proved incapable of coordinating the varied elements of his forces. Popular discontent over the humiliating defeat at Algiers forced Charles to save his commander's life by spiriting him away to remote commands.<ref>Powell pg 886</ref>\n\nFurther changes occurred when Charles appointed the [[Count of Floridablanca]] as his foreign minister in 1777. Supervising Spain's foreign affairs for fifteen years, Floridablanca became one of the most effective and respected of Bourbon public servants. Despite the Algiers invasion, in 1780 Spain and Morocco signed a treaty of friendship at the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1780)|Peace of Aranjuez]] in 1780. Mohammed III recognized that his own interests in Algeria would move forward only if he had Spanish support.<ref>Powell pg 886</ref> In 1785, the sultan demonstrated the extent of his influence in Algiers by sponsoring a treaty between Spain and Algeria after the Spanish attempted twice to bombard Algiers ([[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|August 1783]] and [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|July 1784]]) of which were also met with defeat.<ref>Wolf p. 323-4</ref> The tensions Spain had chronically encountered along the Barbary Coast were reduced.

Once the Spanish had realised they were surrounded it was too late.<ref>Houtsma p. 259</ref> Unable to hold a line of resistance, the Spanish forces were routed, returning in chaos to their ships. The losses were huge; nearly 3,000 casualties, including five generals killed and fifteen wounded (one of these being [[Bernado de Galvez]]) and then abandoning to the Algerians no fewer than 15 guns and some 9000 other weapons.<ref>Wolf p. 322</ref> [[Henry Swinburne]] records that the Spanish would have been \"broken and slaughtered to a man... had not Mr. Acton, the Tuscan commander, cut his cables, and let his ships drive in to shore just as the enemy was coming on us full gallop. The incessant fire of his great guns, loaded with grape-shot, not only stopt them in their career, but obliged them to retire with great loss\".<ref>Travels through Spain, in the years 1775 and 1776, Volume 1, Pages 61-62, By Henry Swinburne, Published 1787</ref> The Spanish had lost many prisoners as many were cut off from returning to their ships. O'Reilly had to wait for a month to negotiate their return. He then wanted to retaliate by bombarding Algiers from the sea, but he learned that he had only enough provisions on board to last for an immediate return to Spain. O'Reilly and the Spanish fleet withdrew to [[Alicante]] with his reputation now in tatters.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough in general Charles III's reforms of the Spanish military would enhance his country's military position, O'Reilly's poor preparations and leadership made the Algiers defeat a mockery of the Spanish army. While the Algerines had detailed intelligence on the Spanish, the Spaniards had no information about them. Where Spain had mostly raw recruits, the Algerians had veteran warriors. The Algerians confronted the Spanish with a united force, whereas O'Reilly and the commander of the Spanish ships had many differences in particular between the navy and the army. This bitterness resulted in an extraordinary lack of planning, which in turn left O'Reilly with inadequate provisions and armaments. O'Reilly proved incapable of coordinating the varied elements of his forces. Popular discontent over the humiliating defeat at Algiers forced Charles to save his commander's life by spiriting him away to remote commands.<ref>Powell pg 886</ref>\n\nFurther changes occurred when Charles appointed the [[Count of Floridablanca]] as his foreign minister in 1777. Supervising Spain's foreign affairs for fifteen years, Floridablanca became one of the most effective and respected of Bourbon public servants. Despite the Algiers invasion, in 1780 Spain and Morocco signed a treaty of friendship at the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1780)|Peace of Aranjuez]] in 1780. Mohammed III recognized that his own interests in Algeria would move forward only if he had Spanish support.<ref>Powell pg 886</ref> In 1785, the sultan demonstrated the extent of his influence in Algiers by sponsoring a treaty between Spain and Algeria after the Spanish attempted twice to bombard Algiers ([[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|August 1783]] and [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|July 1784]]) of which were also met with defeat.<ref>Wolf p. 323-4</ref> The tensions Spain had chronically encountered along the Barbary Coast were reduced. It was now left for European nations to deal with the Barbary pirates and prevention of slavery in particular the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|bombardment of Algiers]] in 1816 by the Royal Navy and Dutch fleet and then when it was vaporized when France [[French conquest of Algeria|finally conquered Algeria]] in the 1830s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book |last=Hull |first=Anthony H. |title=Charles III and the Revival of Spain |location= |publisher=University Press of America |year=1980 |isbn= }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Powell |first=John |title=Great Events from History: The 18th Century 1701-1800 |location=Pasadena, CA |publisher=Salem Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-58765-279-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greateventsfromh0000unse_h8o4 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Wolf |first=John B. |title=The Barbary Coast: Algiers Under the Turks, 1500 to 1830 |location=New York |publisher=W.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee examination from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019. The lawsuit was settled on April 9, 2020, with the perpetrators fined several million yen and banned from future events related to the [[AKB48 Group]].\n\n==Incident==\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Maho Yamaguchi alleged in her [[SHOWROOM (streaming service)|Showroom]] live stream and Twitter that on December 8, 2018, two men (identified by press as two fans, one unemployed and the other an university student, both 25-year old<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html\n | title=\uff2e\uff27\uff34\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093 \u3001\u75372\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u66b4\u884c | language=ja | work=[[Niigata Nippo]] | date=2019-01-10| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513064058/https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html | archivedate=2019-05-13}}</ref>) after hiding in an apartment on the other side which was previously occupied by another member, had tried to break into her personal apartment as she was entering her apartment after prying open her door.

Additionally, she revealed the existence of still-unreleased voice recordings which contained other current members personally admitting to having had private relationship with the group to which the assailants belonged.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189290449158184963\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u30b9\u30dd\u30cb\u30c1\u3055\u3093\u304c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3082\u3046\u95a2\u308f\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u8a00\u308f\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u65b9\u306f\u3054\u5b58\u77e5\u306e\u901a\u308a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306f\u30ea\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3092\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u76ee\u7dda\u3067\u3084\u308b\u306e\u3067\u76f8\u624b\u304c\u4f55\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3082\u307b\u307c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002AKB\u65b0\u805e\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3066\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3082\u5206\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306f\u305a\u306a\u306e\u306b\u9177\u3059\u304e\u308b }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189320193669029890\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u72ec\u5360\u5165\u624b\u3063\u3066\u6628\u65e5\u306e\u88c1\u5224\u8cc7\u6599\uff1f\u6a2a\u6d41\u3057\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f\u4ee5\u5916\u4f55\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f \u8972\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3089\u4f1a\u793e\u306b\u8b1d\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u306fSNS\u3067\u5acc\u304c\u3089\u305b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u8f9e\u3081\u3066\u304b\u3089\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u3084\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u79c1\u306e\u305b\u3044\u306b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3002\u3053\u3093\u306a\u4f1a\u793e\u3042\u308b\uff1f \u72af\u4eba\u3068\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u306f\u73fe\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u8a8d\u3081\u3066\u308b\u306e\u306b\u3002\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u305d\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189328855129116672\n |date=2020-10-30 |title=\u3044\u3084\u3001\u300c\u4ffa\u3082\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u6307\u5b9a\u3057\u30662\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u7e4b\u304c\u308a\u306e\u8a3c\u62e0ww\u300d\u3063\u3066\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u9001\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306e\u3084\u3081\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30e9\u3057\u3066\u305f\u3051\u3069\u7b11\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f \u7686\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://hochi.news/articles/20191030-OHT1T50031.html | title= \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d\u52a0\u5bb3\u8005\u3068\u306e\u201c\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308a\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u4e0d\u5feb\u611f\u2026\u73fe\u5f79\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u8a3c\u62e0\u97f3\u58f0\u6240\u6301\u3082\u793a\u5506  | language=ja | work=[[Sports Hochi]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref> AKS reportedly denied to the media that their side was responsible for leaking the material to the press<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/201910300000274.html\n | title=  \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u304c\u201c\u8a3c\u62e0\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u5426\u5b9a\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d | language=ja | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref>, as did the defendant side via a stream broadcast.

In addition to this, Yamaguchi had also alleged that a member of NGT48 had assisted her attackers by revealing her personal information to them, while the management had done nothing to address her concerns. After mentioning the incident on her live stream, Yamaguchi was forced to apologize to the public, sparking outrage in both domestic and international communities.\n\nFollowing media scrutiny, the NGT48 management hired a new female manager for the group and also led an independent third-party committee examination from January 31, 2019 to March 22, 2019 to determine whether NGT48 members were involved in the attack. After the management claimed that the members were not involved, Yamaguchi's rebuttal prompted the Niigata government to withdraw their support for the group. The NGT48 management responded with an apology and dissolving the team structure within the group, reintroducing all current members as a unified first generation, which later led to Yamaguchi announcing that she was leaving NGT48.\n\nAfter her departure, the management launched a lawsuit against her alleged attackers on May 1, 2019. The lawsuit was settled on April 9, 2020, with the perpetrators fined several million yen and banned from future events related to the [[AKB48 Group]].\n\n==Incident==\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Maho Yamaguchi alleged in her [[SHOWROOM (streaming service)|Showroom]] live stream and Twitter that on December 8, 2018, two men (identified by press as two fans, one unemployed and the other an university student, both 25-year old<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html\n | title=\uff2e\uff27\uff34\u5c71\u53e3\u3055\u3093 \u3001\u75372\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u66b4\u884c | language=ja | work=[[Niigata Nippo]] | date=2019-01-10| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513064058/https://www.niigata-nippo.co.jp/sp/news/national/20190109443510.html | archivedate=2019-05-13}}</ref>) after hiding in an apartment on the other side which was previously occupied by another member, had tried to break into her personal apartment as she was entering her apartment after prying open her door.

Additionally, she revealed the existence of still-unreleased voice recordings which contained other current members personally admitting to having had private relationship with the group to which the assailants belonged.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189290449158184963\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u30b9\u30dd\u30cb\u30c1\u3055\u3093\u304c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3082\u3046\u95a2\u308f\u308a\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u8a00\u308f\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u306e\u65b9\u306f\u3054\u5b58\u77e5\u306e\u901a\u308a\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306f\u30ea\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3092\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9\u76ee\u7dda\u3067\u3084\u308b\u306e\u3067\u76f8\u624b\u304c\u4f55\u306e\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3082\u307b\u307c\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002AKB\u65b0\u805e\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3066\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u306e\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3082\u5206\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306f\u305a\u306a\u306e\u306b\u9177\u3059\u304e\u308b }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189320193669029890\n |date=2020-10-30 |title= \u72ec\u5360\u5165\u624b\u3063\u3066\u6628\u65e5\u306e\u88c1\u5224\u8cc7\u6599\uff1f\u6a2a\u6d41\u3057\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f\u4ee5\u5916\u4f55\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f \u8972\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3089\u4f1a\u793e\u306b\u8b1d\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u306fSNS\u3067\u5acc\u304c\u3089\u305b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3001\u8f9e\u3081\u3066\u304b\u3089\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u3084\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u79c1\u306e\u305b\u3044\u306b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3002\u3053\u3093\u306a\u4f1a\u793e\u3042\u308b\uff1f \u72af\u4eba\u3068\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u306f\u73fe\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u304c\u8a8d\u3081\u3066\u308b\u306e\u306b\u3002\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u305d\u306e\u97f3\u58f0\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=maho_yamaguchi |number=1189328855129116672\n |date=2020-10-30 |title=\u3044\u3084\u3001\u300c\u4ffa\u3082\u5199\u771f\u4f1a\u3067\u30dd\u30fc\u30ba\u6307\u5b9a\u3057\u30662\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u64ae\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u7e4b\u304c\u308a\u306e\u8a3c\u62e0ww\u300d\u3063\u3066\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u5199\u771f\u9001\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306e\u3084\u3081\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30e9\u3057\u3066\u305f\u3051\u3069\u7b11\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f \u7686\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://hochi.news/articles/20191030-OHT1T50031.html | title= \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d\u52a0\u5bb3\u8005\u3068\u306e\u201c\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308a\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u4e0d\u5feb\u611f\u2026\u73fe\u5f79\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u8a3c\u62e0\u97f3\u58f0\u6240\u6301\u3082\u793a\u5506  | language=ja | work=[[Sports Hochi]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref> AKS reportedly denied to the media that their side was responsible for leaking the material to the press<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/201910300000274.html\n | title=  \u5c71\u53e3\u771f\u5e06\u304c\u201c\u8a3c\u62e0\u5199\u771f\u201d\u5831\u9053\u5426\u5b9a\u300c\u540d\u8a89\u6bc0\u640d\u3059\u304e\u308b\u300d | language=ja | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | date=2019-10-30}}</ref>, as did the defendant side via a stream broadcast.
