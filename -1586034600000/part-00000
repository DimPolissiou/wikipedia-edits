While it is referred to as a \"palace\" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.\n\nThe complex was built on a peninsula six kilometers southwest from [[Salona]], the capital of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)]], one of the [[Demography of the Roman Empire#Urbanization|largest cities of the late empire]] with 60,000 people and the birthplace of Diocletian. The terrain around Salona slopes gently seaward and is typical [[karst]], consisting of low [[limestone]] ridges running east to west with [[marl]] in the clefts between them. Today the remains of the palace are part of the historic core of Split, which in 1979 was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[Diocletian]] had ordered the construction of the heavily fortified compound near his hometown of [[Spalatum]] in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305 AD.<ref>Fik Meijer (2004) ''Emperors Don't Die in Bed''  p. 114</ref>. The site chosen was near [[Salona]], the provincial administrative center of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], on the southern side of a short peninsula,  On the basis of Roman map data (known through the medieval parchment ''Tabula Peutingeriana''), there was already a Spalatum settlement in that bay, the remains and size of which have not yet been established. \n\n[[Image:Diocletian's Palace (original appearance).jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of Diocletian's Palace in its original appearance upon completion in AD 305 (viewed from the south-west)]]\nThe beginning of the construction of Diocletian's palace has not exactly been established. It is assumed to have begun around 295, after the introduction of the [[Tetrarchy]] (the rule of four). Yet ten years after that decision, when Diocletian abdicated in 305, the palace seems to have still been unfinished, and there are indications that some works were taking place while the emperor was residing at the Palace. It is unknown under whose architectural ideas the palace was built and who its builders were. The complex was modeled on [[Roman forts]] of the 3rd-century era, examples of which can be seen across the Limes, such as the bridgehead fort [[Divitia]] across the [[Rhine]] from [[Cologne]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. ''The Late Roman Army'' p. 34</ref> \n\nHowever, the engraved Greek names Zotikos and Filotas, as well as many Greek characters, indicate that a number of builders were originally from the eastern part of the empire, i.e. Diocletian brought with him masters from the East. Still, it is highly likely that a large part of the workforce was of local origin. The basic materials came from close proximity. The white limestone comes from [[Bra\u010d]] and some of Seget near [[Trogir]]; [[tufa]] was extracted from nearby riverbeds and bricks were made in [[Spalatum]] and other workshops located nearby. The building as a whole did not have an immediate role in Roman construction in the past. Its source comes from the basic function and position adjustment.\n\nAt [[Carnuntum]], people begged Diocletian to return to the throne in order to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian \nfamously replied:\n{{quote|If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>}}\nThis was a reference to the Emperor retiring to his palace to grow cabbages.\n\nDiocletian lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318. Until recently, the date of 3 December 311 has been favoured; however, the absence of Diocletian on Maxentius' \"''AETERNA MEMORIA''\" coins would indicate that he was alive through to Maxentius' defeat in October 312. Given that Diocletian had died by the time of [[Maximinus II|Maximian Daia]]'s death in July 313, it has been argued that the correct date of his death was 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" />|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nWith the death of Diocletian, the life of the palace did not end, and it remained an imperial possession of the Roman court, providing shelter to the expelled members of the Emperor's family. In 480, Emperor [[Julius Nepos]] was murdered by one of his own soldiers, reportedly stabbed to death in his villa near Salona.<ref>{{ill|Wilhelm Ensslin|de|Wilhelm En\u00dflin}}, \"Julius Nepos\", in ''Paulys Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft'', Band XVI,2 (1935), S. 1505\u20131510.</ref> Since Diocletian's palace was in the area, it might have been the same building. \n\nIts second life came when [[Salona]] was largely destroyed in the invasions of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] in the 7th century, though the exact year of the destruction still remains an open debate between archaeologists. Part of the expelled population, now refugees, found shelter inside the palace's strong walls and with them a new, organized city life began.<ref>Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference'' (1913).

Today many restaurants and shops, and some homes can still be found within the walls.\n\nIn the period of the free medieval commune, between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was a greater architectural development, when many medieval houses filled not only Roman buildings but also a large part of the free space of streets and docks. Also completed in this period was the construction of the Romanesque bell tower of the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]], which inhabits the building that was originally erected as Jupiter's temple and then used as the Mausoleum of Diocletian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/how-life-goes-on-in-a-ruined-roman-palace/|title=How life goes on in a ruined Roman palace|date=2016-12-22|website=Apollo Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Middle Ages]], the palace was virtually unknown in the rest of Europe, until the Scottish architect [[Robert Adam]] had the ruins surveyed. Then, with the aid of French artist and antiquary [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau]] and several draughtsmen, Adam published ''Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia'' (London, 1764).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/RuinspalaceEmpe00Adam Text] at Archive.org; [http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/ruinspalaceempe00adam Text] at the Smithsonian Institution; [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?id=DLDecArts.AdamRuins Text] at University of Wisconsin</ref>\n\nDiocletian's palace was an inspiration for Adam's new style of [[Neoclassical architecture]]<ref name=\"CMHogan\">Hogan, C. Michael,  [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691  \"Diocletian's Palace\"], The Megalithic Portal, A. Burnham ed., 6 October 2007.</ref> and the publication of measured drawings brought it into the design vocabulary of European architecture for the first time. A few decades later, in 1782, the French painter [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cassas]] created drawings of the palace, published by [[Joseph Lavall\u00e9e]] in 1802 in the chronicles of his voyages.<ref>''Voyage pittoresque et historique de l'Istrie et de la Dalmatie r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s l'Itin\u00e9raire de L.

Diocletian's Palace far transcends local importance because of its degree of preservation. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian [[Adriatic]] coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in Mediterranean, European, and world heritage.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\n[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, Robert Adam, 1764 (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the Peristyle in 1764, engraving by [[Robert Adam]]. The Peristyle is the central square of the palace, where the main entrance to Diocletian's quarters (pictured) is located.]]\n\nIn November 1979 [[UNESCO]], in line with the international convention on cultural and natural heritage, adopted a proposal that the historic city of Split built around the Palace should be included in the register of [[World Cultural Heritage]].<ref>[http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html Diocletian Palace]</ref>\n\nIn November 2006 the City Council decided to permit over twenty new buildings within the palace (including a shopping and garage complex), although the palace had been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Monument. It is said that this decision was politically motivated and largely due to lobbying by local property developers. Once the public in 2007 became aware of the project, they petitioned against the decision and won. No new buildings, shopping center or the underground garage were built.\n\nThe [[World Monuments Fund]] has been working on a conservation project at the palace, including surveying structural integrity and cleaning and restoring the stone and plasterwork.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Croatian 500 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] banknote, issued in 1993.<ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 Features of Kuna Banknotes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012028/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 |date=6 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 500 kuna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014206/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 |date=4 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Tafel 001a Spalato - Grundriss vom Kaiserpalast - Robert Adam 1764 -.jpg|thumb| Floor plan of Diocletian's palace]]\nThe ground plan of the palace is an irregular rectangle measuring east: 214.97 m, north: 174.74 m, south: 181.65 m (adjusting for the terrain), with sixteen towers projecting from the western, northern, and eastern facades on the facades facing the mainland and four towers on the corners of the square are ground floor gives the palace a characteristic of the [[Roman fortifications|legionary forts]] similar to those on the [[Danube]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. The Late Roman Army p. 143</ref> \n\nTwo of the six octagonal ground-floor towers were framed by three landing entrances, the six rectangular ground floors of the rectangular floor being between the corner and the octagonal. To date, three corner corners (except southwestern) have been preserved, and only the remains of octagonal and rectangular ones. Three well-preserved landings have been architecturally fragmented, especially the northern one, which was the main approach from [[Salona]]. The south, [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|seaside gate]], small, simple and well preserved. The facade walls of the palace in their lower parts are massive and simple without openings, and in the upper part they are exposed to large arches that are simple to the land, ie on the west, north and east facades. [[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace|Subterranean portions]] of the palace feature [[barrel vault]]ed stonework.\n\n===Outer walls===\nOnly the southern facade, which rose directly from or very near to the sea, was unfortified. The elaborate architectural composition of the arcaded gallery on its upper floor differs from the more severe treatment of the three shore facades. A monumental gate in the middle of each of these walls led to an enclosed courtyard. The southern [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|\u2019Sea Gate\u2019]] (the ''Porta Meridionalis'') was simpler in shape and dimensions than the other three, and it is thought that it was originally intended either as the emperor's private access to the sea, or as a service entrance for supplies.\n\n===The North Gate===\n{{Main|Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)}}\n\n[[File:SPLIT-Porta Aurea restitution.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Porta Septemtrionalis]]\nThe Porta septemtrionalis (\"the northern gate) \"is one of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace.

From there, one approached the Emperor's apartment, which stretched 40 m deep along the entire south facade; it is only partly preserved in the upper floor, but its ground-floor, translated substructures that directly bore it are almost completely preserved, so the overall layout and appearance of the upper spaces can be seen given the coincidence of the upper and lower floor plans. On the west side of the upper floor are preserved the remains of a dome hall and two halls with apses, and on the east side are parts of an octagonal dining room ([[triclinium]]) with three halls with a cross floor plan. The wall of the Western Cross Hall is preserved in full height. Diocletian's apartment was interconnected by a long room along the southern fa\u00e7ade (cryptoporticus)<ref> https://visitsplit.com/en/525/vestibule</ref> from which through 42 windows and 3 balconies a view of the sea was opened. Two baths were recently found north of the Emperor's apartment, one adjacent to the west and the other to the eastern halls. Although for many centuries almost completely filled with refuse, most of the substructure is well preserved and indicates the original shape and disposition of the rooms above.\n\n====The Vestibule====\n{{Main|Vestibule (Split)}}\nA rotonda, that was once the first section of the imperial corridor in the Palace that led via [[Peristyle|the Peristyle]] to the Imperial apartments<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/split/attractions/vestibule/a/poi-sig/1544002/358789</ref> of the Palace. \n\n====The Palace Cellars====\n{{Main|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace}}\n[[File:Split D81 3055 (38620797821).jpg|thumb|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]]\nSet below what were the Imperial apartments, the Cellars of Diocletian Palace are a set of substructures, located at the southern end of the Palace,<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.absolute-croatia.com/split-region-dalmatia/split/attractions/item/diocletians-palace-basements-split|title=Diocletian's palace basement, Split|website=www.absolute-croatia.com}}</ref> that represent one of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://visitsplit.com/en/529/the-substructures|title=Split - The Substructures|website=visitsplit.com}}</ref>\n\n====Peristyle====\nA monumental court, called the [[Peristyle]], formed the Northern access to the imperial apartments in front of the Vestibule. It also gave access to Diocletian's mausoleum on the East (today the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]]), and to three temples on the West (two of which are now lost, with the third, originally being the [[Temple of Jupiter, Split|temple of Jupiter]], becoming a baptistery). There is also a temple just to the west of the Peristylum called The Temple of [[Aesculapius]], which has a semi-cylindrical roof built of stone blocks, which did not leak until the 1940s when it was covered with a lead roof. The temple was recently restored.\n\n====Northern half====\nThe northern half of the palace, divided into two parts by the main north-south street (''[[cardo]]'') leading from the [[Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Golden Gate]] (''Porta aurea'') to the Peristyle, is less well preserved. It is usually supposed that each part was a residential complex, housing soldiers, servants, and possibly some other facilities.\n\n====Streets and annex buildings====\nBoth parts of the palace were apparently surrounded by streets,<ref>http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html</ref> leading to the perimeter walls through a rectangular buildings (possibly storage magazines).{{dubious|According to floor-plan, it's rather ALONGSIDE.|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Building materials===\n[[File:SPLIT-Sphinx peristyle.jpg|thumb|Sphinx at the Peristyle]]\nThe Palace is built of white local [[limestone]] and [[marble]] of high quality, most of which was from the Bra\u010d marble quarries on the island of [[Bra\u010d]], of [[tuff]] taken from the nearby river beds, and of brick made in [[Salona|Salonitan]] and other factories.

While it is referred to as a \"palace\" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.\n\nThe complex was built on a peninsula six kilometers southwest from [[Salona]], the capital of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)]], one of the [[Demography of the Roman Empire#Urbanization|largest cities of the late empire]] with 60,000 people and the birthplace of Diocletian. The terrain around Salona slopes gently seaward and is typical [[karst]], consisting of low [[limestone]] ridges running east to west with [[marl]] in the clefts between them. Today the remains of the palace are part of the historic core of Split, which in 1979 was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[Diocletian]] had ordered the construction of the heavily fortified compound near his hometown of [[Spalatum]] in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305 AD.<ref>Fik Meijer (2004) ''Emperors Don't Die in Bed''  p. 114</ref>. The site chosen was near [[Salona]], the provincial administrative center of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], on the southern side of a short peninsula,  On the basis of Roman map data (known through the medieval parchment ''Tabula Peutingeriana''), there was already a Spalatum settlement in that bay, the remains and size of which have not yet been established. \n\n[[Image:Diocletian's Palace (original appearance).jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of Diocletian's Palace in its original appearance upon completion in AD 305 (viewed from the south-west)]]\nThe beginning of the construction of Diocletian's palace has not exactly been established. It is assumed to have begun around 295, after the introduction of the [[Tetrarchy]] (the rule of four). Yet ten years after that decision, when Diocletian abdicated in 305, the palace seems to have still been unfinished, and there are indications that some works were taking place while the emperor was residing at the Palace. It is unknown under whose architectural ideas the palace was built and who its builders were. The complex was modeled on [[Roman forts]] of the 3rd-century era, examples of which can be seen across the Limes, such as the bridgehead fort [[Divitia]] across the [[Rhine]] from [[Cologne]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. ''The Late Roman Army'' p. 34</ref> \n\nHowever, the engraved Greek names Zotikos and Filotas, as well as many Greek characters, indicate that a number of builders were originally from the eastern part of the empire, i.e. Diocletian brought with him masters from the East. Still, it is highly likely that a large part of the workforce was of local origin. The basic materials came from close proximity. The white limestone comes from [[Bra\u010d]] and some of Seget near [[Trogir]]; [[tufa]] was extracted from nearby riverbeds and bricks were made in [[Spalatum]] and other workshops located nearby. The building as a whole did not have an immediate role in Roman construction in the past. Its source comes from the basic function and position adjustment.\n\nAt [[Carnuntum]], people begged Diocletian to return to the throne in order to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian \nfamously replied:\n{{quote|If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>}}\nThis was a reference to the Emperor retiring to his palace to grow cabbages.\n\nDiocletian lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318. Until recently, the date of 3 December 311 has been favoured; however, the absence of Diocletian on Maxentius' \"''AETERNA MEMORIA''\" coins would indicate that he was alive through to Maxentius' defeat in October 312. Given that Diocletian had died by the time of [[Maximinus II|Maximian Daia]]'s death in July 313, it has been argued that the correct date of his death was 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" />|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nWith the death of Diocletian, the life of the palace did not end, and it remained an imperial possession of the Roman court, providing shelter to the expelled members of the Emperor's family. In 480, Emperor [[Julius Nepos]] was murdered by one of his own soldiers, reportedly stabbed to death in his villa near Salona.<ref>{{ill|Wilhelm Ensslin|de|Wilhelm En\u00dflin}}, \"Julius Nepos\", in ''Paulys Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft'', Band XVI,2 (1935), S. 1505\u20131510.</ref> Since Diocletian's palace was in the area, it might have been the same building. \n\nIts second life came when [[Salona]] was largely destroyed in the invasions of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] in the 7th century, though the exact year of the destruction still remains an open debate between archaeologists. Part of the expelled population, now refugees, found shelter inside the palace's strong walls and with them a new, organized city life began.<ref>Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference'' (1913).

Today many restaurants and shops, and some homes can still be found within the walls.\n\nIn the period of the free medieval commune, between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was a greater architectural development, when many medieval houses filled not only Roman buildings but also a large part of the free space of streets and docks. Also completed in this period was the construction of the Romanesque bell tower of the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]], which inhabits the building that was originally erected as Jupiter's temple and then used as the Mausoleum of Diocletian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/how-life-goes-on-in-a-ruined-roman-palace/|title=How life goes on in a ruined Roman palace|date=2016-12-22|website=Apollo Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Middle Ages]], the palace was virtually unknown in the rest of Europe, until the Scottish architect [[Robert Adam]] had the ruins surveyed. Then, with the aid of French artist and antiquary [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau]] and several draughtsmen, Adam published ''Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia'' (London, 1764).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/RuinspalaceEmpe00Adam Text] at Archive.org; [http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/ruinspalaceempe00adam Text] at the Smithsonian Institution; [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?id=DLDecArts.AdamRuins Text] at University of Wisconsin</ref>\n\nDiocletian's palace was an inspiration for Adam's new style of [[Neoclassical architecture]]<ref name=\"CMHogan\">Hogan, C. Michael,  [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691  \"Diocletian's Palace\"], The Megalithic Portal, A.

A few decades later, in 1782, the French painter [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cassas]] created drawings of the palace, published by [[Joseph Lavall\u00e9e]] in 1802 in the chronicles of his voyages.<ref>''Voyage pittoresque et historique de l'Istrie et de la Dalmatie r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s l'Itin\u00e9raire de L.

Diocletian's Palace far transcends local importance because of its degree of preservation. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian [[Adriatic]] coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in Mediterranean, European, and world heritage.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\n[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, Robert Adam, 1764 (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the Peristyle in 1764, engraving by [[Robert Adam]]. The Peristyle is the central square of the palace, where the main entrance to Diocletian's quarters (pictured) is located.]]\n\nIn November 1979 [[UNESCO]], in line with the international convention on cultural and natural heritage, adopted a proposal that the historic city of Split built around the Palace should be included in the register of [[World Cultural Heritage]].<ref>[http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html Diocletian Palace]</ref>\n\nIn November 2006 the City Council decided to permit over twenty new buildings within the palace (including a shopping and garage complex), although the palace had been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Monument. It is said that this decision was politically motivated and largely due to lobbying by local property developers. Once the public in 2007 became aware of the project, they petitioned against the decision and won. No new buildings, shopping center or the underground garage were built.\n\nThe [[World Monuments Fund]] has been working on a conservation project at the palace, including surveying structural integrity and cleaning and restoring the stone and plasterwork.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Croatian 500 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] banknote, issued in 1993.<ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 Features of Kuna Banknotes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012028/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 |date=6 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 500 kuna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014206/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 |date=4 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Tafel 001a Spalato - Grundriss vom Kaiserpalast - Robert Adam 1764 -.jpg|thumb| Floor plan of Diocletian's palace]]\nThe ground plan of the palace is an irregular rectangle measuring east: 214.97 m, north: 174.74 m, south: 181.65 m (adjusting for the terrain), with sixteen towers projecting from the western, northern, and eastern facades on the facades facing the mainland and four towers on the corners of the square are ground floor gives the palace a characteristic of the [[Roman fortifications|legionary forts]] similar to those on the [[Danube]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. The Late Roman Army p. 143</ref> \n\nTwo of the six octagonal ground-floor towers were framed by three landing entrances, the six rectangular ground floors of the rectangular floor being between the corner and the octagonal. To date, three corner corners (except southwestern) have been preserved, and only the remains of octagonal and rectangular ones. Three well-preserved landings have been architecturally fragmented, especially the northern one, which was the main approach from [[Salona]]. The south, [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|seaside gate]], small, simple and well preserved. The facade walls of the palace in their lower parts are massive and simple without openings, and in the upper part they are exposed to large arches that are simple to the land, ie on the west, north and east facades. [[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace|Subterranean portions]] of the palace feature [[barrel vault]]ed stonework.\n\n===Outer walls===\nOnly the southern facade, which rose directly from or very near to the sea, was unfortified. The elaborate architectural composition of the arcaded gallery on its upper floor differs from the more severe treatment of the three shore facades. A monumental gate in the middle of each of these walls led to an enclosed courtyard. The southern [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|\u2019Sea Gate\u2019]] (the ''Porta Meridionalis'') was simpler in shape and dimensions than the other three, and it is thought that it was originally intended either as the emperor's private access to the sea, or as a service entrance for supplies.\n\n===The North Gate===\n{{Main|Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)}}\n\n[[File:SPLIT-Porta Aurea restitution.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Porta Septemtrionalis]]\nThe Porta septemtrionalis (\"the northern gate) \"is one of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace.

Two baths were recently found north of the Emperor's apartment, one adjacent to the west and the other to the eastern halls. Although for many centuries almost completely filled with refuse, most of the substructure is well preserved and indicates the original shape and disposition of the rooms above.\n\n====The Vestibule====\n{{Main|Vestibule (Split)}}\nA rotonda, that was once the first section of the imperial corridor in the Palace that led via [[Peristyle|the Peristyle]] to the Imperial apartments<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/split/attractions/vestibule/a/poi-sig/1544002/358789</ref> of the Palace. \n\n====The Palace Cellars====\n{{Main|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace}}\n[[File:Split D81 3055 (38620797821).jpg|thumb|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]]\nSet below what were the Imperial apartments, the Cellars of Diocletian Palace are a set of substructures, located at the southern end of the Palace,<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.absolute-croatia.com/split-region-dalmatia/split/attractions/item/diocletians-palace-basements-split|title=Diocletian's palace basement, Split|website=www.absolute-croatia.com}}</ref> that represent one of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://visitsplit.com/en/529/the-substructures|title=Split - The Substructures|website=visitsplit.com}}</ref>\n\n====Peristyle====\nA monumental court, called the [[Peristyle]], formed the Northern access to the imperial apartments in front of the Vestibule. It also gave access to Diocletian's mausoleum on the East (today the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]]), and to three temples on the West (two of which are now lost, with the third, originally being the [[Temple of Jupiter, Split|temple of Jupiter]], becoming a baptistery). There is also a temple just to the west of the Peristylum called The Temple of [[Aesculapius]], which has a semi-cylindrical roof built of stone blocks, which did not leak until the 1940s when it was covered with a lead roof. The temple was recently restored.\n\n====Northern half====\nThe northern half of the palace, divided into two parts by the main north-south street (''[[cardo]]'') leading from the [[Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Golden Gate]] (''Porta aurea'') to the Peristyle, is less well preserved. It is usually supposed that each part was a residential complex, housing soldiers, servants, and possibly some other facilities.\n\n====Streets and annex buildings====\nBoth parts of the palace were apparently surrounded by streets,<ref>http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html</ref> leading to the perimeter walls through a rectangular buildings (possibly storage magazines).{{dubious|According to floor-plan, it's rather ALONGSIDE.|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Building materials===\n[[File:SPLIT-Sphinx peristyle.jpg|thumb|Sphinx at the Peristyle]]\nThe Palace is built of white local [[limestone]] and [[marble]] of high quality, most of which was from the Bra\u010d marble quarries on the island of [[Bra\u010d]], of [[tuff]] taken from the nearby river beds, and of brick made in [[Salona|Salonitan]] and other factories. Some material for decoration was imported: [[Egypt]]ian [[granite]] [[column]]s, fine marble for revetments and some capitals produced in workshops in the [[Proconnesos]].\n\n===Egyptian sphinxes===\nThe Palace was decorated with numerous 3500-year-old granite [[sphinx]]es, originating from the site{{dubious|What site?

Growing up on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] around the corner from [[Rock Steady Park]], home of the [[breakdance|breakdancing]] pioneers [[Rock Steady Crew]], Fontaine did some DJing himself while attending [[Bronx High School of Science]].<ref name=Getlen>Larry Getlen, \"A Better Vibe\", ''Wesleyan'' ([[Wesleyan University]] alumni magazine), Issue IV 2006, p. 28\u201332.</ref>\n\nAt [[Wesleyan University]] ([[Middletown, Connecticut]]), Fontaine double-majored in [[English studies|English]] and [[African-American studies]];<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/alumni/aoc/newsletter/5/reunion.html Wesleyan.edu]</ref> while in college he met Stephanie Addison, his future wife.<ref name=Getlen />\n\nAfter two years teaching in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], as part of the [[Teach for America]] program, he returned to New York City, interned for ''[[VIBE]]'', and began writing on the side for British [[hip hop]] magazine ''[[True (British hip-hop magazine)|True]]'', soon renamed as ''[[Trace (magazine)|Trace]]'', where he eventually became an editor and hired away his own previous editor at ''VIBE'', [[Scott Poulson-Bryant]].<ref name=Getlen />\n\nWhile at ''True''/''Trace'' he befriended [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]. His editor-in-chief thought the relationship was too close, and that Combs was using him. \"We were certainly being hustled,\" said Fontaine later, \"but in all hustles, there has to be a counter-hustle.\" Fontaine thought that their \"little magazine with no money and no marketing\" stood to \"ride [Combs'] coattails\"; the editor-in-chief disagreed; Fontaine soon left to become features editor for ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''.<ref name=Getlen />\n\nAn assignment to write a cover story on rapper [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] resulted in his spending two years as part of DMX's posse, getting 350 hours of \"interviews\" with him, which he shaped into ''E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX''.<ref name=Getlen />\n\nIn 2001, Fontaine hooked up with [[Damon Dash]] (rapper [[Jay-Z]]'s manager); Dash financed the magazine ''[[America (hip hop magazine)|America]]'', with Fontaine running the show. The magazine first appeared in spring 2004. Fontaine left in 2006 after a falling out with Dash; he left to become editor-in-chief of ''[[GIANT]]'', starting with the August 2006 issue.<ref name=Getlen />\n\n==Works==\nFormerly, Fontaine was the CEO and Editor-in-Chief of ''GIANT'', the magazine of celebrity, style, and culture. Since taking the helm of the newly re-launched publication in August 2006, Fontaine cemented his status as one of the hottest editors in the magazine world with back-to-back covers of [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs]], [[Janet Jackson]], '''Jennifer Lopez''', [[Chris Brown]], [[Rihanna]], [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].\nPrior to that, Fontaine was most notably the Senior Producer of Entertainment for Volume.com, the $35 million Internet portal sponsored by [[HBO]]; the US Editor of ''Trace'' magazine, where he secured the fashion and music magazine's US distribution and advertising deals and wrote nine cover stories; and the Music Editor of ''The Source'', where he oversaw the growth of the world's largest music magazine on the newsstand and was nominated for a National Magazine Award for General Excellence in 2000.\n\n''america'', an \u201curban luxury\u201d publication he dreamed up while visiting his childhood home in London, England, enabled Fontaine to run his own company and continue his high-end cross-platform work with clients that included Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, Target and Lexus. His ''42-page portfolio'' with [[Sean Combs|Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs]] and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz by photographer Peter Lindbergh for [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] is considered an advertorial benchmark.\n\nIn 2002, Fontaine released his first two books. The first, ''What\u2019s Your HI-FI Q?'' (Simon & Schuster/Fireside) with partner Scott Poulson-Bryant, is an entertaining trivia book wrapped around three decades of black popular music; the second, ''The Autobiography of DMX'' (Harper Collins Entertainment), is a 350+ page life history of hip-hop's most tortured superstar hailed by Publisher's Weekly as an \u201cunsparing, painfully honest account\u2026[akin to] '''[[Manchild in the Promised Land|Manchild In The Promised Land]].\u201d'''\n\nFontaine's first published piece was a retrospective essay about his relationship with [[James Baldwin]] for the ''Diary of the Civil Rights Movement'' in 1989 and he has since twice received the prestigious \u201cSpotlight Article of the Month\u201d award from the London Guardian newspaper. In 2010, Fast Company named Fontaine one of Teach For America's \u201cMost Influential Alumni\u201d and in 2012 he was honored with a \u201cMost Inspiring\u201d Telly Award for \u201cMost Inspiring\u201d for his writing / hosting of [[AT&T]]\u2019s ''Rethink Possible'' video series.\n\nFontaine is also a featured music correspondent for the BBC and Channel 4 networks in England, and is a repeat guest on [[CNN]], [[The Today Show]], FOX News, [[VH-1]], [[MSNBC]], Roland Martin's Washington Watch, and the [[Rev.

Growing up on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] around the corner from [[Rock Steady Park]], home of the [[breakdance|breakdancing]] pioneers [[Rock Steady Crew]], Fontaine did some DJ'ing himself while attending [[Bronx High School of Science]].<ref name=Getlen>Larry Getlen, \"A Better Vibe\", ''Wesleyan'' ([[Wesleyan University]] alumni magazine), Issue IV 2006, p. 28\u201332.</ref>\n\nAt [[Wesleyan University]] ([[Middletown, Connecticut]]), Fontaine double-majored in [[English studies|English]] and [[African-American studies]];<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/alumni/aoc/newsletter/5/reunion.html Wesleyan.edu]</ref> while in college he met Stephanie Addison, his future wife.<ref name=Getlen />\n\nAfter two years teaching in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], as part of the [[Teach for America]] program, he returned to New York City, interned for ''[[VIBE]]'', and began writing on the side for British [[hip hop]] magazine ''[[True (British hip-hop magazine)|True]]'', soon renamed as ''[[Trace (magazine)|Trace]]'', where he eventually became an editor and hired away his own previous editor at ''VIBE'', [[Scott Poulson-Bryant]].<ref name=Getlen />\n\nWhile at ''True''/''Trace'' he befriended [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]. His editor-in-chief thought the relationship was too close, and that Combs was using him. \"We were certainly being hustled,\" said Fontaine later, \"but in all hustles, there has to be a counter-hustle.\" Fontaine thought that their \"little magazine with no money and no marketing\" stood to \"ride [Combs'] coattails\"; the editor-in-chief disagreed; Fontaine soon left to become features editor for ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''.<ref name=Getlen />\n\nAn assignment to write a cover story on rapper [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] resulted in his spending two years as part of DMX's posse, getting 350 hours of \"interviews\" with him, which he shaped into ''E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX''.<ref name=Getlen />\n\nIn 2001, Fontaine hooked up with [[Damon Dash]] (rapper [[Jay-Z]]'s manager); Dash financed the magazine ''[[America (hip hop magazine)|America]]'', with Fontaine running the show. The magazine first appeared in spring 2004. Fontaine left in 2006 after a falling out with Dash; he left to become editor-in-chief of ''[[GIANT]]'', starting with the August 2006 issue.<ref name=Getlen />\n\n==Works==\nFormerly, Fontaine was the CEO and Editor-in-Chief of ''GIANT'', the magazine of celebrity, style, and culture. Since taking the helm of the newly re-launched publication in August 2006, Fontaine cemented his status as one of the hottest editors in the magazine world with back-to-back covers of [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs]], [[Janet Jackson]], '''Jennifer Lopez''', [[Chris Brown]], [[Rihanna]], [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].\nPrior to that, Fontaine was most notably the Senior Producer of Entertainment for Volume.com, the $35 million Internet portal sponsored by [[HBO]]; the US Editor of ''Trace'' magazine, where he secured the fashion and music magazine's US distribution and advertising deals and wrote nine cover stories; and the Music Editor of ''The Source'', where he oversaw the growth of the world's largest music magazine on the newsstand and was nominated for a National Magazine Award for General Excellence in 2000.\n\n''america'', an \u201curban luxury\u201d publication he dreamed up while visiting his childhood home in London, England, enabled Fontaine to run his own company and continue his high-end cross-platform work with clients that included Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, Target and Lexus. His ''42-page portfolio'' with [[Sean Combs|Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs]] and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz by photographer Peter Lindbergh for [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Estee Lauder]] is considered an advertorial benchmark.\n\nIn 2002, Fontaine released his first two books. The first, ''What\u2019s Your HI-FI Q?'' (Simon & Schuster/Fireside) with partner Scott Poulson-Bryant, is an entertaining trivia book wrapped around three decades of black popular music; the second, ''The Autobiography of DMX'' (Harper Collins Entertainment), is a 350+ page life history of hip-hop's most tortured superstar hailed by Publisher's Weekly as an \u201cunsparing, painfully honest account\u2026[akin to] '''[[Manchild in the Promised Land|Manchild In The Promised Land]].\u201d'''\n\nFontaine's first published piece was a retrospective essay about his relationship with [[James Baldwin]] for the ''Diary of the Civil Rights Movement'' in 1989 and he has since twice received the prestigious \u201cSpotlight Article of the Month\u201d award from the London Guardian newspaper. In 2010, Fast Company named Fontaine one of Teach For America's \u201cMost Influential Alumni\u201d and in 2012 he was honored with a \u201cMost Inspiring\u201d Telly Award for \u201cMost Inspiring\u201d for his writing / hosting of [[AT&T]]\u2019s ''Rethink Possible'' video series.\n\nFontaine is also a featured music correspondent for the BBC and Channel 4 networks in England, and is a repeat guest on [[CNN]], [[The Today Show]], FOX News, [[VH-1]], [[MSNBC]], Roland Martin's Washington Watch, and the [[Rev. Al Sharpton|Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s]] \u201cKeeping It Real\u201d syndicated radio broadcast.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, \"A three-track set of undulating dance grooves that capture a vibe the bassist describes as 'hopeful melancholy,' it's the culmination of a hobby Baio took up half a decade ago as a student at Columbia University in New York.\"  Baio drew a lot of inspiration from electronic and dance music and spent much of the past year on DJ'ing due to Vampire Weekend's light tour schedule, and he said, \"I'd lock myself in my little office in my apartment with CDJs and a [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixer]] and just practice mixing all day.  I did that quite a bit while we were touring the last record and realized when we finished touring that I really wanted to pursue it.\"  His first completed track was \"Sunburn Modern,\" which was inspired by a \"nasty, modern art\"-looking sunburn he got from a trip to [[Mexico]] with his girlfriend.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hyman |first=Dan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/vampire-weekend-hatching-a-ton-of-material-for-new-lp-20120426 |title=Vampire Weekend Hatching 'A Ton' of Material for New LP |date=April 26, 2012 |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis solo album, titled ''The Names'', was released in 2015.

I still like it. It could be Greatest Hits. It's the one with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' on it.

Clark can be traced back to 1821 when Cyrus Clark (1801\u20131866) entered into a partnership with a [[Quakers|Quaker]] cousin in the trade of [[fellmongering]], [[wool-stapling]] and tanning in Street, Somerset.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anon.|title=Clarks of Street|date=1825\u20131950|publisher=Unknown|location=1950|page=7}}</ref> By 1825, this partnership had been dissolved and Cyrus relocated to a site on the High Street in Street, utilising premises that belonged to his father-in-law to exploit his idea of making rugs out of sheepskins instead of pulling off the wool.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George Barry|title=A History of Shoe Making in Street, Somerset: C. & J. Clarks, 1833\u20131903|date=1979|publisher=William Sessions|location=York|page=2}}</ref> C. & J. Clark recognise this as the beginning of their business and continue to occupy the site upon which Cyrus started to this very day.\n\nBy 1828, as the business had grown, Cyrus appointed his younger brother James (1811\u20131906) as an apprentice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=K.|title=Towards Precision Shoemaking|date=1968|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|pages=14\u201316}}</ref> Educated away from Street, James was meant to be apprentice to a chemist in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], but successfully pleaded with his parents to let him stay in Street and help Cyrus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J. Clark, 1825\u20131975|publisher=Unknown|page=5}}</ref> In 1828\u20131829, whilst serving this apprenticeship, James began utilising the offcuts that were too short for making rugs to produce slippers (known as Brown Petersburgs).<ref>{{cite book|last=Fingers|first=A.|title=Clarks in Jamaica|publisher=One Love Books|location=London|page=16}}</ref> The slippers were made using outworkers who collected materials from the factory, assembled footwear in workshops at home and returned the finished product for payment. This trade rapidly evolved, providing James with a legitimate claim to an equal partnership in the business when his apprenticeship was served in 1833.<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=M.|title=Made to Last: The Story of Britain's Best Known Shoe Firm|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|pages=19\u201320}}</ref> Thereafter, it traded as C. & J. Clark.\n\nThe brothers developed national and international trade (Ireland in the 1820s, Canada by the 1830s, Australia in the 1850s) and were notably innovative, winning the Gold Medal at the [[Great Exhibition]] in 1851 for their gutta percha elongated galosh.<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=M.|title=Made to Last: The Story of Britain's Best Known Shoe Firm|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|page=31}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J.

Clark both as a pioneer of new technology and as a champion of footwear innovation. James withdrew from the partnership in 1889, to be replaced by his son Francis, William's younger brother.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J. Clark, 1825\u20131975|publisher=Unknown|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn line with the family's Quaker values, the capital was also extended beyond the factory to benefit social initiatives in Street: a school was founded so that young men and women could combine working in the factory with continuing their education, a theatre was opened, a library was built, along with an open-air swimming pool and town hall. Playing fields were established for the benefit of all and low-cost housing was provided by the company for its employees.\n\n===1904\u20131945 \u2013 Style, technology and foot measuring===\n[[File:Clarks vintage photograph - man packing Clarks Tor Shoes.jpg|thumbnail|left|An employee carefully packing some of the premium Clarks Tor products]]\nIn 1903 the partnership arrangement was discontinued in favour of a [[private limited company]]. This enabled the succession to the third generation of family members as children of William Stephens Clark became \u2018life directors\u2019 alongside Francis and himself. Tasked with specific responsibilities, Alice Clark, John Bright Clark and Roger Clark developed distinct roles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=M.|title=Made to Last: The Story of Britain's Best Known Shoe Firm|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|page=108}}</ref>\n\nBrothers John Bright and Roger Clark studied American making processes and techniques with a view to appointing a suitable candidate experienced in the American factory system that they might bring to Street. John Walter Bostock from [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] was recruited in 1904. The implementation was a resounding success and Bostock was made a director of the company in 1928.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anon.|title=Clarks of Street|date=1825\u20131950|publisher=Unknown|location=1950|page=50}}</ref>\n\nA London Office, opened in the [[West End of London|West End]] in 1908, supplemented the shoemaking knowledge with style information.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J.

A premium quality \u2018Tor\u2019 range was produced on the principles of standard lines, followed by a range of affordable fashionable footwear called \u2018Wessex\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=K.|title=Towards Precision Shoemaking|date=1968|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|pages=142\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nThe company had its first national press advertisement in 1934, and entered formally into retailing in 1937 through the acquisition of Abbotts chain of shops based around [[London]] and the provinces. \"Peter Lord\" was created by Hugh Bryan Clark as a retail brand to avoid alarming agents or alerting competitors to the company's activities. It steadily evolved into a national network of stores.\n\nGrowing awareness that \u2018bad feet\u2019 were the product of ill-fitting shoes determined Bostock to devise a new shoe fitting system based on the detailed analysis of thousands of foot measurements taken from local school children. In line with the findings the company launched its new children's ranges in 1945 with a choice of four width fittings, simultaneously with the new Clarks footgauge that acted as a scientific measuring instrument to aid the shop assistant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=K.|title=Towards Precision Shoemaking|date=1968|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|page=83}}</ref>\n\n===1946\u20131995 \u2013 Growth and challenges===\n[[File:Nathan Clark holding a Desert Boot.jpg|thumbnail|right|Nathan Clark holding a Desert Boot]]\nExpansion of the business post-war was largely initiated by fourth generation family members: Bancroft Clark, appointed Managing Director and Chairman in 1942 and his cousins,  Anthony Clark and Peter Clothier, accountable for Sales/Marketing and Manufacturing respectively.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J.

Nathan Clark (younger brother of Bancroft) negotiated a number of these agreements in his capacity as Overseas Manager until 1952.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=K.|title=Towards Precision Shoemaking|date=1968|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|pages=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nBancroft retired in 1967.

Initiated by Bronson Davis, a car salesman, who had seen the Desert Boot at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. Davis established a sales organization covering 150 accounts with outlets that stocked Clarks products, predominantly Desert Boots. He also sponsored advertisements for Clarks shoes in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazines.\n\nDavis established relations with some of America's most prestigious retailers; [[Abercrombie & Fitch]], [[Neiman-Marcus]] and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]]. The coverage for the Desert Boot was consolidated by advertising that targeted the \u2018campus trade\u2019 of [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of North Carolina|North Carolina]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities through ads in ''Esquire'' and college magazines.\n\nA young salesman named Robert (Bob) Cullerton followed Bronson Davis at the lead in America. Appointed President in April 1961, he inherited a business focussed on the provision of men's casuals and the Desert Boot. He appointed designer Nancy Knox to create a new range advertised via ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Gentleman's Quarterly|Gentlemen\u2019s Quarterly]]''.\n\nIn parallel with American developments, C&J Clark Ltd. acquired the Blachford Shoe Manufacturing Co. Ltd. of Toronto in 1952, establishing a foothold in Canada led by Hugh Woods and Harold Hughes. Similarities between the businesses in Canada and North America meant Cullerton, Woods and Hughes quickly collaborated. They developed a clear vision of what women's sandals and shoes were required to supplement the demand for men's casual offerings. An Italian resourcing programme was started by Woods in 1960 to get more style and variety into the ranges.\n\nOffices were opened in the [[Empire State Building]], [[New York City|New York]] in April 1964. Sales were also buoyed by the introduction of the Wallabee in the late 1960s and expansion towards the West Coast. Wholesaling interests were complemented with retail from the late 1970s through the acquisition of [[Hanover Shoe|Hanover Shoes Inc.]] who owned 220 retail shops.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Clarks|url=http://www.clarksusa.com/eng/aboutUs/aboutclarks.cfm|publisher=C & J Clarks|accessdate=29 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429183434/http://www.clarksusa.com/eng/aboutUs/aboutclarks.cfm|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At the same time C&J Clark decided to bring together its North American interests under one corporation to operate Hanover, Clarks of England and Clarks Canada.<ref name=\"jrank\">{{cite web |url=http://companies.jrank.org/pages/737/C-J-Clark-International-Ltd.html |title=C&J Clark International Ltd.

Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark (great-grandson of James Clark).\n\nNathan Clark was an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps posted to [[Burma]] in 1941 with orders to help establish a supply route from [[Rangoon]] to the [[Republic of China|Chinese]] forces at [[Chongqing]] whilst also launching a series of offensives throughout South East Asia. Before leaving home his brother Bancroft had given him the mission to gather any information on footwear that might be of use to the company whilst he was travelling the world. The Desert Boot was the result of this mission.\n\nHis discovery of the Desert Boot was made either at Staff College in 1944 or on leave in [[Kashmir]] where three divisions of the old Eighth Army (transferred to the Far East from North Africa) were wearing ankle high suede boots manufactured in the bazaars of [[Cairo]]. Nathan sent sketches and rough patterns back to Bancroft, but no trials were made until after he returned to Street and cut the patterns himself.\n\nThe Desert Boot was cut on the men's Guernsey Sandal last and sampled in a neutral beige-grey 2mm chrome bend split [[suede]]. The company's Stock Committee reacted badly to the sample and dismissed the idea as it \u2018would never sell\u2019. It was only in his capacity as Overseas Development Manager that Nathan had any success with the shoe after introducing it to Oskar Schoefler (Fashion Editor, ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'') at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. He gave them substantial editorial credits with colour photographs in ''Esquire'' in early 1950. Bronson Davies subsequently saw these articles and applied to represent the company in selling them across the US, long before they were available in the UK. The Desert Boot was initially sold in Britain through shops in [[Regent Street]], featuring a [[Union Jack]] sewn into the label, targeted at tourists. Lance Clark is widely credited with popularising them in Europe during the 1960s.\n\nThe Desert Boot have been manufactured at Shepton Mallet, small scale production having initially occurred at Street. During the course of time, Whitecross factory in [[Weston-Super-Mare]] was subcontracted to relieve Shepton factory of the manufacture of the Desert Boot, before the Bushacre factory at Locking Road, Weston-Super-Mare was constructed in 1958. The Desert Boot was manufactured there until closure of the factory in 2001.\n\nClarks announced in July 2017, it was restarting manufacturing Desert Boots, using a new manufacturing unit featuring \"robot-assisted\" technology, at its headquarters in Street, Somerset. Up to 300,000 pairs a year of desert boots were to be made at the unit, creating up to eighty technical and managerial jobs.

This particular pair was used as school shoes]] \nProduced by Clarks from 1967 and based on a moccasin called the Grashopper, launched in 1964, by the German company Sioux, the Wallabee brand was manufactured at the Padmore and Barnes factory based in [[Kilkenny]], Ireland, which Clarks had acquired in 1963 and continued to operate until its closure in 1987, when it was the subject of a management buy-out. Managed by Lance Clark who was responsible for having negotiated the licence to produce the shoes in Kilkenny and arranged for the factory staff to be trained in the production of moccasin shoes, the product took off once the decision was taken to market it in North America in 1968. As General Manager of the factory, Paddy Roberts took the shoe to a trade fair in New York in the same year, whereupon he quickly learnt that the trademark Grasshopper had been licensed. In conjunction with Jack Rose-Smith (Clarks Overseas Shoes Export Manager), Bob Cullerton (the President for Clarks in America/Clarks of England), Hugh Woods (Managing Director of Clarks Canada), Roberts trademarked the name Wallabee.\n\n===Desert Trek===\n\nAnother style associated with the Lance Clark who had seen a Zwartjes version of the shoe on the feet of artist, [[Sonja Landweer]] in the late 1960s. An artist in residence at the Kilkenny Design Workshops, where she had come into contact with Lance Clark, Landweer's shoes became the basis for production of the Trek which was first attempted at Clarks factory in [[Dundalk]]. This was more attuned to the construction of stitch-down footwear. The shoe was initially launched in North America in 1971 as Trek, before featuring in the UK range in 1972 where it was renamed Hike, owing to an existing footwear trademark. The \u2018Trek man\u2019 that first featured on the shoe was drafted by Lance Clark and refined by the advertising manager in Dundalk, Bob Patten.\n\n==Popular culture==\n\nSome Clarks styles (particularly the Desert Boot, Wallabee & Desert Trek) were widely adopted as cultural icons by different subcultures and featured in songs as well as popular films and TV series.\n\n===Jamaica===\nThe most referenced is the popularity of the Clarks shoes in [[Jamaica]] and the association with the Jamaican \"[[rude boy]]s\" movement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurmen|first=Esra|title=Why Does Dancehall Love Clarks Shoes?|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/read/clarks|publisher=Noisey|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531090857/http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/read/clarks|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Horan|first=Tom|title=Clarks, the shoes that tap to Jamaica's reggae beat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/28/clarks-shoes-reggae-jamaica-feature|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530044842/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/28/clarks-shoes-reggae-jamaica-feature|archivedate=30 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Jake|title=Rude Shoes Jamaica\u2019s Love Affair With Clarks|url=http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2014/03/11/rude-shoes-jamaicas-love-affair-clarks/|publisher=A continuous lean|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317092742/http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2014/03/11/rude-shoes-jamaicas-love-affair-clarks/|archivedate=17 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to DJ, producer and cultural historian [[Al Fingers]] in his book, ''Clarks in Jamaica'', this trend started in the late 1960s when the emerging youth culture of the recently independent Jamaica adopted the Clarks shoes as part of their \"uniform.\" \"The original gangster rude boy dem, a Clarks dem wear,\" producer [[Jah Thomas]] tells Fingers in the book. \"And in Jamaica a rude boy him nah wear cheap ting.\" Writes Fingers, \"In the early 70s, the rude boy/desert boot association became so strong that young males risked a beating by police simply for wearing a pair. 'You must be a thief,' the police would say. 'How else would you afford such expensive Clarks?'\" He tells the story of an infamous Kingston police officer called Joe Williams, who carried out a raid on a dance being run by producer and label boss [[Coxsone Dodd|\"Sir Coxsone\" Dodd]]. The [[Dennis Alcapone|DJ Dennis Alcapone]] recalls the arrival of Superintendent Williams: \"He tell the DJ to turn the sound down, and he say: 'All who's wearing Clarks booty, stand on that side of the dance. And who's not wearing Clarks booty stand on this side.' Because he knows that rude boys wear them, so that is a way of identifying them.\"<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.alnewmandesign.com/942/books/clarks-in-jamaica/ | title=Clarks in Jamaica | publisher=One Love Books | author=Fingers, Al | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-9567773-3-1 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207140940/http://www.alnewmandesign.com/942/books/clarks-in-jamaica/ | archivedate=7 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nReggae and dancehall stars [[Dillinger (musician)|Dillinger]], [[Trinity (musician)|Trinity]], [[Ranking Joe]], [[Errol Scorcher|Scorcher]], [[Little John (musician)|Little John]], [[Super Cat]] and countless others had sung about Clarks in the past.

The rebirth of the Clarks Wallabees as a cool staple from mid-late 1990s is linked with New York-based hip-hop group the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].  Wu members ([[RZA]], [[GZA]], [[Method Man]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Inspectah Deck]], [[U-God]], [[Masta Killa]], and the late [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]) and in particular Raekwon and Ghostface Killah wore Wallabees because not only they found them aesthetically pleasing but also since no other rapper was wearing them, they showed that they weren't victims of the trends. They even featured the name of the shoe in the lyrics of several songs, engendering a revival of the Wallabees as a [[hip-hop]] staple by the mid-late 1990s. This justified Ghostface Killah to call himself Wally Champ and feature custom-dyed Wallabee shoes on the cover of his 1996 \"[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]\" album. His 2008 compilation album was also called \"[[The Wallabee Champ]]\".<ref name=\"Chaplin\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Blanco|first=Alvin|title=The Wu-Tang Clan and RZA: A Trip Through Hip Hop's 36 Chambers|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Praeger Publishers Inc}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wu-Tang lifted the Clarks Wallabee shoe-boot, literally!|url=http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/wu-tang-lifted-the-clarks-wallabee-shoe-boot-literally|publisher=Tune Swag|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140530163941/http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/wu-tang-lifted-the-clarks-wallabee-shoe-boot-literally|archivedate=30 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RZA\u2019s Closet \u2013 Full of Wallabees!|url=http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/rzas-closet-full-of-wallabees|publisher=Tune Swag|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140530164000/http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/rzas-closet-full-of-wallabees|archivedate=30 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=DeLeon|first=Jian|title=A history of style trends started by rappers|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/style-trends-started-by-rappers/wallabees|publisher=Complez Style|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720145339/http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/style-trends-started-by-rappers/wallabees|archivedate=20 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wallabbe Champ|url=http://www.jadamix.com/the-wallabee-champ/|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105638/http://www.jadamix.com/the-wallabee-champ/|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nas|title=Nas affirmative action lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Nas-affirmative-action-lyrics#note-55784|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124111/http://rapgenius.com/Nas-affirmative-action-lyrics#note-55784|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Raekwon|title=Raekwon son of sam lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Raekwon-son-of-sam-lyrics#note-1760189|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105755/http://rapgenius.com/Raekwon-son-of-sam-lyrics#note-1760189|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nIn the cult TV series, ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', lead character [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] (played by [[Bryan Cranston]]) morphs from a bland high school chemistry teacher into an all-powerful drug kingpin with trademark pork pie hat, black sunglasses and goatee, but he still wears Wallabees, just about the only shoe he wears from the beginning of the five-season series until its completion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/08/breaking-bad-costumer-interview.html | title=''Breaking Bad''\u2019s Season Five Costume Designer on Walt\u2019s Darker Look | publisher=Vulture (New York Media) | date=8 August 2012 | accessdate=7 February 2015 | author=Watkins, Gwynne | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207140443/http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/breaking-bad-costumer-interview.html | archivedate=7 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Heritage==\n[[File:CandJ Clark - geograph.org.uk - 800601.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Shoe Museum]] in [[Street, Somerset]].]]\n[[The Shoe Museum]] was established in 1950 by Laurence Barber at 40 High Street near the Clark's headquarters in Street, Somerset.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://alfredgilletttrust.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pos1.pdf |title=Point of Sale Collection, 1849-2013 (p. 3) |last=Virahsawmy |first=Karina |last2=Berry |first2=Charlotte |date=27 Dec 2013 |website=alfredgilletttrust.org |publisher=Alfred Gillett Trust |access-date=12 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812215350/https://alfredgilletttrust.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pos1.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Today the museum displays some 1,500 shoes as well as related exhibits, describing the development of shoes from Roman times and especially detailing the growth of Clarks shoes and shoemaking in Somerset.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-shoe-museum.org/our-museum |title=The Shoe Museum \u2013 Our Museum |publisher=The Shoe Museum |access-date=12 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816063408/https://www.the-shoe-museum.org/our-museum |archivedate=16 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2002, a charity called the Alfred Gillett Trust was established to care for the archives and collections of C&J Clark Ltd and the Clark family.

Clark recognise this as the beginning of their business and continue to occupy the site upon which Cyrus started to this very day.\n\nBy 1828, as the business had grown, Cyrus appointed his younger brother James (1811\u20131906) as an apprentice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=K.|title=Towards Precision Shoemaking|date=1968|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|pages=14\u201316}}</ref> Educated away from Street, James was meant to be apprentice to a chemist in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], but successfully pleaded with his parents to let him stay in Street and help Cyrus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J.

Playing fields were established for the benefit of all and low-cost housing was provided by the company for its employees.\n\n===1904\u20131945 \u2013 Style, technology and foot measuring===\n[[File:Clarks vintage photograph - man packing Clarks Tor Shoes.jpg|thumbnail|left|An employee carefully packing some of the premium Clarks Tor products]]\nIn 1903 the partnership arrangement was discontinued in favour of a [[private limited company]].

John Walter Bostock from [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] was recruited in 1904. The implementation was a resounding success and Bostock was made a director of the company in 1928.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anon.|title=Clarks of Street|date=1825\u20131950|publisher=Unknown|location=1950|page=50}}</ref>\n\nA London Office, opened in the [[West End of London|West End]] in 1908, supplemented the shoemaking knowledge with style information.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J.

It steadily evolved into a national network of stores.\n\nGrowing awareness that \u2018bad feet\u2019 were the product of ill-fitting shoes determined Bostock to devise a new shoe fitting system based on the detailed analysis of thousands of foot measurements taken from local school children. In line with the findings the company launched its new children's ranges in 1945 with a choice of four width fittings, simultaneously with the new Clarks footgauge that acted as a scientific measuring instrument to aid the shop assistant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=K.|title=Towards Precision Shoemaking|date=1968|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|page=83}}</ref>\n\n===1946\u20131995 \u2013 Growth and challenges===\n[[File:Nathan Clark holding a Desert Boot.jpg|thumbnail|right|Nathan Clark holding a Desert Boot]]\nExpansion of the business post-war was largely initiated by fourth generation family members: Bancroft Clark, appointed Managing Director and Chairman in 1942 and his cousins,  Anthony Clark and Peter Clothier, accountable for Sales/Marketing and Manufacturing respectively.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehane|first=B.|title=C. & J.

Initiated by Bronson Davis, a car salesman, who had seen the Desert Boot at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. Davis established a sales organization covering 150 accounts with outlets that stocked Clarks products, predominantly Desert Boots. He also sponsored advertisements for Clarks shoes in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazines.\n\nDavis established relations with some of America's most prestigious retailers; [[Abercrombie & Fitch]], [[Neiman-Marcus]] and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]]. The coverage for the Desert Boot was consolidated by advertising that targeted the \u2018campus trade\u2019 of [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of North Carolina|North Carolina]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities through ads in ''Esquire'' and college magazines.\n\nA young salesman named Robert (Bob) Cullerton followed Bronson Davis at the lead in America. Appointed President in April 1961, he inherited a business focussed on the provision of men's casuals and the Desert Boot. He appointed designer Nancy Knox to create a new range advertised via ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Gentleman's Quarterly|Gentlemen\u2019s Quarterly]]''.\n\nIn parallel with American developments, C&J Clark Ltd. acquired the Blachford Shoe Manufacturing Co. Ltd. of Toronto in 1952, establishing a foothold in Canada led by Hugh Woods and Harold Hughes. Similarities between the businesses in Canada and North America meant Cullerton, Woods and Hughes quickly collaborated. They developed a clear vision of what women's sandals and shoes were required to supplement the demand for men's casual offerings. An Italian resourcing programme was started by Woods in 1960 to get more style and variety into the ranges.\n\nOffices were opened in the [[Empire State Building]], [[New York City|New York]] in April 1964. Sales were also buoyed by the introduction of the Wallabee in the late 1960s and expansion towards the West Coast. Wholesaling interests were complemented with retail from the late 1970s through the acquisition of [[Hanover Shoe|Hanover Shoes Inc.]] who owned 220 retail shops.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Clarks|url=http://www.clarksusa.com/eng/aboutUs/aboutclarks.cfm|publisher=C & J Clarks|accessdate=29 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429183434/http://www.clarksusa.com/eng/aboutUs/aboutclarks.cfm|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At the same time C&J Clark decided to bring together its North American interests under one corporation to operate Hanover, Clarks of England and Clarks Canada.<ref name=\"jrank\">{{cite web |url=http://companies.jrank.org/pages/737/C-J-Clark-International-Ltd.html |title=C&J Clark International Ltd.

Clarks school shoes have long had a reputation of being robust, hard-wearing and comfortable for children to wear to school, with many parents citing that the shoes, if worn sensibly and not used for tough playground games such as football, can last the whole school year<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/best-school-shoes-2016-secondary-school-narrow-feet-clarks-next-asda-9669703.html|title=14 best school shoes|author=|date=14 August 2014|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322032135/http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/best-school-shoes-2016-secondary-school-narrow-feet-clarks-next-asda-9669703.html|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (lasting from August\u2013June in Scotland, and September\u2013July in England and Wales).\n\nClarks continue to perform well in the school shoe market, recently, however, Clarks has come up towards fierce competitions from the likes of [[Start-rite]], [[Hush Puppies]], [[Geox]] and cheaper alternative school shoes from supermarkets such as [[Asda]] and [[Tesco]].<ref name=\"mumsnet.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/primary/1229213-School-shoes-Are-Clarks-crap|title=School shoes...

''The Independent'' also raised their own concerns \u2013 teenagers in the United Kingdom have tended to associate Clarks shoes with being \"uncool\" in recent years, meaning parents may struggle to encourage their teenage aged children to wear Clarks for school purposes. Clarks, however, continues to sell well in the school shoe market in the United Kingdom for a variety of ages and reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/kids/clothing-footwear/best-kids-shoe-brands-children-for-toddlers-school-clarks-crocs-list-bobux-a7863191.html|title=12 best kids' shoe brands|author=|date=27 July 2017|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322024614/http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/kids/clothing-footwear/best-kids-shoe-brands-children-for-toddlers-school-clarks-crocs-list-bobux-a7863191.html|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nPart of the reason, despite being long lasting and durable, parents have opted for Clarks school shoes for their children is that almost every Clarks design of school shoes has been classed as \"acceptable\" shoes in line with most primary and secondary school uniform policies. In recent years, notably in mid\u20132010s, schools have reviewed their uniform policies and have instead identified a few of Clarks designs for school shoes as being \"unacceptable\" and not complying with the school uniform policy of the school.\n\nIn 2016, nationwide attention was gathered after 12 year old Alfie Ingerfeild from [[Bristol]] was sent home from school at the beginning of the new school term in September after wearing a pair of Harlem Spin shoes from Clarks' Bootleg school shoe range.<ref name=\"bristolpost.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/48-clarks-school-shoes-look-975|title=Do these \u00a348 Clarks school shoes look like trainers to you?|first=Emma|last=Grimshaw|date=6 September 2016|website=bristolpost.co.uk|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090258/https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/48-clarks-school-shoes-look-975|archivedate=18 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The school, [[Mangotsfield School]], claimed that the Harlem Spin design was \"too much like trainers\" and therefore classed them as unacceptable and not complying with the school uniform policy, so much so to the extent that the Deputy Head Teacher of Mangotsfield School said that should the shoes be worn the following school then the pupil would be asked to remove them and forced to wear shoes from lost property.<ref name=\"bristolpost.co.uk\"/> This is despite the fact that the Harlem Spin shoes were advertised by Clarks as being school shoes \u2013 Clarks did not give a statement in regards to the incident and questions over the design of the Harlem Spin shoes.<ref name=\"bristolpost.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn 2017, a particular style of [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Jane]] shoes called \"Dolly Babe\" was compared unfavourably to Clarks' own \"Leader\" school shoe for boys, with parents and ministers both accusing the company of sexism and [[gender stereotype]]s \u2013 the Mary Janes in question being viewed as flimsy and stereotypically feminine with a heart-print insole and a heart-shaped charm on the toebox while the boys' shoe was seen as sturdier. The company soon apologised over the matter and withdrew the shoe from sale.

Officially launched in 1950 the Desert Boot was designed by Nathan Clark (great-grandson of James Clark).\n\nNathan Clark was an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps posted to [[Burma]] in 1941 with orders to help establish a supply route from [[Rangoon]] to the [[Republic of China|Chinese]] forces at [[Chongqing]] whilst also launching a series of offensives throughout South East Asia. Before leaving home his brother Bancroft had given him the mission to gather any information on footwear that might be of use to the company whilst he was travelling the world. The Desert Boot was the result of this mission.\n\nHis discovery of the Desert Boot was made either at Staff College in 1944 or on leave in [[Kashmir]] where three divisions of the old Eighth Army (transferred to the Far East from North Africa) were wearing ankle high suede boots manufactured in the bazaars of [[Cairo]]. Nathan sent sketches and rough patterns back to Bancroft, but no trials were made until after he returned to Street and cut the patterns himself.\n\nThe Desert Boot was cut on the men's Guernsey Sandal last and sampled in a neutral beige-grey 2mm chrome bend split [[suede]]. The company's Stock Committee reacted badly to the sample and dismissed the idea as it \u2018would never sell\u2019. It was only in his capacity as Overseas Development Manager that Nathan had any success with the shoe after introducing it to Oskar Schoefler (Fashion Editor, ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'') at the Chicago Shoe Fair in 1949. He gave them substantial editorial credits with colour photographs in ''Esquire'' in early 1950. Bronson Davies subsequently saw these articles and applied to represent the company in selling them across the US, long before they were available in the UK. The Desert Boot was initially sold in Britain through shops in [[Regent Street]], featuring a [[Union Jack]] sewn into the label, targeted at tourists. Lance Clark is widely credited with popularising them in Europe during the 1960s.\n\nThe Desert Boot have been manufactured at Shepton Mallet, small scale production having initially occurred at Street. During the course of time, Whitecross factory in [[Weston-Super-Mare]] was subcontracted to relieve Shepton factory of the manufacture of the Desert Boot, before the Bushacre factory at Locking Road, Weston-Super-Mare was constructed in 1958. The Desert Boot was manufactured there until closure of the factory in 2001.\n\nClarks announced in July 2017, it was restarting manufacturing Desert Boots, using a new manufacturing unit featuring \"robot-assisted\" technology, at its headquarters in Street, Somerset. Up to 300,000 pairs a year of desert boots were to be made at the unit, creating up to eighty technical and managerial jobs. However, in January 2019 the company announced that this unit was to be closed, after failing to meet production targets.<ref>Beth Wright, [https://www.just-style.com/news/clarks-to-close-cutting-edge-uk-footwear-factory_id135419.aspx Clarks to close cutting edge footwear factory] dated 18 January 2019 at just-style.com</ref>\n[[File:Clarks Wallabee in Cola Suede.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Clarks Wallabee]]\n\n===Wallabee===\n[[File:Clarks Wallabies.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of Clarks Wallabies. This particular pair was used as school shoes]] \nProduced by Clarks from 1967 and based on a moccasin called the Grashopper, launched in 1964, by the German company Sioux, the Wallabee brand was manufactured at the Padmore and Barnes factory based in [[Kilkenny]], Ireland, which Clarks had acquired in 1963 and continued to operate until its closure in 1987, when it was the subject of a management buy-out. Managed by Lance Clark who was responsible for having negotiated the licence to produce the shoes in Kilkenny and arranged for the factory staff to be trained in the production of moccasin shoes, the product took off once the decision was taken to market it in North America in 1968. As General Manager of the factory, Paddy Roberts took the shoe to a trade fair in New York in the same year, whereupon he quickly learnt that the trademark Grasshopper had been licensed. In conjunction with Jack Rose-Smith (Clarks Overseas Shoes Export Manager), Bob Cullerton (the President for Clarks in America/Clarks of England), Hugh Woods (Managing Director of Clarks Canada), Roberts trademarked the name Wallabee.\n\n===Desert Trek===\n\nAnother style associated with the Lance Clark who had seen a Zwartjes version of the shoe on the feet of artist, [[Sonja Landweer]] in the late 1960s. An artist in residence at the Kilkenny Design Workshops, where she had come into contact with Lance Clark, Landweer's shoes became the basis for production of the Trek which was first attempted at Clarks factory in [[Dundalk]]. This was more attuned to the construction of stitch-down footwear. The shoe was initially launched in North America in 1971 as Trek, before featuring in the UK range in 1972 where it was renamed Hike, owing to an existing footwear trademark. The \u2018Trek man\u2019 that first featured on the shoe was drafted by Lance Clark and refined by the advertising manager in Dundalk, Bob Patten.\n\n==Popular culture==\n\nSome Clarks styles (particularly the Desert Boot, Wallabee & Desert Trek) were widely adopted as cultural icons by different subcultures and featured in songs as well as popular films and TV series.\n\n===Jamaica===\nThe most referenced is the popularity of the Clarks shoes in [[Jamaica]] and the association with the Jamaican \"[[rude boy]]s\" movement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gurmen|first=Esra|title=Why Does Dancehall Love Clarks Shoes?|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/read/clarks|publisher=Noisey|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531090857/http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/read/clarks|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Horan|first=Tom|title=Clarks, the shoes that tap to Jamaica's reggae beat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/28/clarks-shoes-reggae-jamaica-feature|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530044842/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/28/clarks-shoes-reggae-jamaica-feature|archivedate=30 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Jake|title=Rude Shoes Jamaica\u2019s Love Affair With Clarks|url=http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2014/03/11/rude-shoes-jamaicas-love-affair-clarks/|publisher=A continuous lean|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317092742/http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2014/03/11/rude-shoes-jamaicas-love-affair-clarks/|archivedate=17 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to DJ, producer and cultural historian [[Al Fingers]] in his book, ''Clarks in Jamaica'', this trend started in the late 1960s when the emerging youth culture of the recently independent Jamaica adopted the Clarks shoes as part of their \"uniform.\" \"The original gangster rude boy dem, a Clarks dem wear,\" producer [[Jah Thomas]] tells Fingers in the book. \"And in Jamaica a rude boy him nah wear cheap ting.\" Writes Fingers, \"In the early 70s, the rude boy/desert boot association became so strong that young males risked a beating by police simply for wearing a pair. 'You must be a thief,' the police would say. 'How else would you afford such expensive Clarks?'\" He tells the story of an infamous Kingston police officer called Joe Williams, who carried out a raid on a dance being run by producer and label boss [[Coxsone Dodd|\"Sir Coxsone\" Dodd]]. The [[Dennis Alcapone|DJ Dennis Alcapone]] recalls the arrival of Superintendent Williams: \"He tell the DJ to turn the sound down, and he say: 'All who's wearing Clarks booty, stand on that side of the dance. And who's not wearing Clarks booty stand on this side.' Because he knows that rude boys wear them, so that is a way of identifying them.\"<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.alnewmandesign.com/942/books/clarks-in-jamaica/ | title=Clarks in Jamaica | publisher=One Love Books | author=Fingers, Al | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-9567773-3-1 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207140940/http://www.alnewmandesign.com/942/books/clarks-in-jamaica/ | archivedate=7 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nReggae and dancehall stars [[Dillinger (musician)|Dillinger]], [[Trinity (musician)|Trinity]], [[Ranking Joe]], [[Errol Scorcher|Scorcher]], [[Little John (musician)|Little John]], [[Super Cat]] and countless others had sung about Clarks in the past.

Their appeal can be traced to a wave of Jamaican immigrants who came to New York in the 70's and paired Clarks shoes with suits. \"African-Americans saw it as an alternative to sneakers and jeans and incorporated it into their look,\" said [[Slick Rick]], a rapper, whose parents were born in Jamaica and later moved to [[the Bronx]]. \"It's a way to be casual but not look like a scrub. The ladies like that.\"<ref name=\"Chaplin\">{{cite web|last=Chaplin|first=Julia|title=NOTICED; A Sensible Shoe Becomes Hip, From Runways to Rap Videos|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/26/style/noticed-a-sensible-shoe-becomes-hip-from-runways-to-rap-videos.html?src=pm&pagewanted=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531090708/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/26/style/noticed-a-sensible-shoe-becomes-hip-from-runways-to-rap-videos.html?src=pm&pagewanted=1|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe shoe was long a staple of fashionable West Indians in New York City but towards the 90's had fallen out of favor in hip-hop circles who tended to gravitate toward [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] boots or sneakers. The rebirth of the Clarks Wallabees as a cool staple from mid-late 90's is linked with New York-based hip-hop group the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].  Wu members ([[RZA]], [[GZA]], [[Method Man]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Inspectah Deck]], [[U-God]], [[Masta Killa]], and the late [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]) and in particular Raekwon and Ghostface Killah wore Wallabees because not only they found them aesthetically pleasing but also since no other rapper was wearing them, they showed that they weren't victims of the trends. They even featured the name of the shoe in the lyrics of several songs, engendering a revival of the Wallabees as a [[hip-hop]] staple by the mid-late 90's. This justified Ghostface Killah to call himself Wally Champ and feature custom-dyed Wallabee shoes on the cover of his 1996 \"[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]\" album. His 2008 compilation album was also called \"[[The Wallabee Champ]]\".<ref name=\"Chaplin\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Blanco|first=Alvin|title=The Wu-Tang Clan and RZA: A Trip Through Hip Hop's 36 Chambers|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Praeger Publishers Inc}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wu-Tang lifted the Clarks Wallabee shoe-boot, literally!|url=http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/wu-tang-lifted-the-clarks-wallabee-shoe-boot-literally|publisher=Tune Swag|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140530163941/http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/wu-tang-lifted-the-clarks-wallabee-shoe-boot-literally|archivedate=30 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RZA\u2019s Closet \u2013 Full of Wallabees!|url=http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/rzas-closet-full-of-wallabees|publisher=Tune Swag|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140530164000/http://hiphop.tuneswag.com/shoes/rzas-closet-full-of-wallabees|archivedate=30 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=DeLeon|first=Jian|title=A history of style trends started by rappers|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/style-trends-started-by-rappers/wallabees|publisher=Complez Style|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720145339/http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/style-trends-started-by-rappers/wallabees|archivedate=20 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wallabbe Champ|url=http://www.jadamix.com/the-wallabee-champ/|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105638/http://www.jadamix.com/the-wallabee-champ/|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nas|title=Nas affirmative action lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Nas-affirmative-action-lyrics#note-55784|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124111/http://rapgenius.com/Nas-affirmative-action-lyrics#note-55784|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Raekwon|title=Raekwon son of sam lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Raekwon-son-of-sam-lyrics#note-1760189|accessdate=30 May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105755/http://rapgenius.com/Raekwon-son-of-sam-lyrics#note-1760189|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nIn the cult TV series, ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', lead character [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] (played by [[Bryan Cranston]]) morphs from a bland high school chemistry teacher into an all-powerful drug kingpin with trademark pork pie hat, black sunglasses and goatee, but he still wears Wallabees, just about the only shoe he wears from the beginning of the five-season series until its completion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/08/breaking-bad-costumer-interview.html | title=''Breaking Bad''\u2019s Season Five Costume Designer on Walt\u2019s Darker Look | publisher=Vulture (New York Media) | date=8 August 2012 | accessdate=7 February 2015 | author=Watkins, Gwynne | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207140443/http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/breaking-bad-costumer-interview.html | archivedate=7 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Heritage==\n[[File:CandJ Clark - geograph.org.uk - 800601.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Shoe Museum]] in [[Street, Somerset]].]]\n[[The Shoe Museum]] was established in 1950 by Laurence Barber at 40 High Street near the Clark's headquarters in Street, Somerset.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://alfredgilletttrust.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pos1.pdf |title=Point of Sale Collection, 1849-2013 (p. 3) |last=Virahsawmy |first=Karina |last2=Berry |first2=Charlotte |date=27 Dec 2013 |website=alfredgilletttrust.org |publisher=Alfred Gillett Trust |access-date=12 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812215350/https://alfredgilletttrust.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pos1.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Today the museum displays some 1,500 shoes as well as related exhibits, describing the development of shoes from Roman times and especially detailing the growth of Clarks shoes and shoemaking in Somerset.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-shoe-museum.org/our-museum |title=The Shoe Museum \u2013 Our Museum |publisher=The Shoe Museum |access-date=12 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816063408/https://www.the-shoe-museum.org/our-museum |archivedate=16 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2002, a charity called the Alfred Gillett Trust was established to care for the archives and collections of C&J Clark Ltd and the Clark family.
