Tori is roped into helping Trina and her project partner Andre Harris ([[Leon Thomas III]]) prepare for their performance for the showcase in a few days, including Trina singing a song Andre wrote for her. When Trina's tongue becomes swollen and she cannot sing properly, Andre tells Tori to fill in for Trina, but she refuses. They force her on stage and, with the help of Andre, Tori receives a [[standing ovation]] from the crowd, and accepts the offer to join Hollywood Arts. On her first day, she meets [[Cat Valentine (Victorious)|Cat Valentine]] ([[Ariana Grande]]), a girl who seems to be living in her own head, Robbie Shapiro ([[Matt Bennett]]), an awkward, nerdy student who speaks through his dummy Rex Powers, handsome Beck Oliver ([[Avan Jogia]]), and his mean girlfriend Jade West ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]). After accidentally spilling coffee on Beck and trying to wipe the stain off his shirt, Tori finds herself at the wrath of Jade, who thinks that Tori is flirting with Beck. Jade does an improv scene with Tori, having Tori portray a dog, but then takes iced coffee and spills it on top of Tori, causing her to leave the room in humiliation. After the altercation with Jade, Tori wonders if she is good enough for, or even belongs at Hollywood Arts. At the insistence of Trina and Andre, who tell her not to let a mean girl crush her confidence, Tori returns to class and subsequently gets revenge on Jade by besting her in an improv assignment and then by kissing Beck in front of her.\n\n''Song featured:'' \"Make It Shine\" (performed by Victoria Justice), which becomes the series' theme song.\n| LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 2\n| EpisodeNumber2= 2\n| Title= The Bird Scene\n| DirectedBy= Steve Hoefer\n| WrittenBy= Dan Schneider\n| OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2010|4|11}}\n| ProdCode= 102\n| Aux4= 3.5<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/13/nickelodeons-victorious-tops-basic-cable-in-total-viewers-in-time-slot-with-3-5-million/48204 Nickelodeon's Victorious Tops Basic Cable In Total Viewers In Time Slot With 3.5 Million] Posted on 13 April 2010 by Bill Gorman of TVbythenumbers.com</ref>\n| ShortSummary= Tori wants to try out for the lead role in a play called \"Moonlight Magic\", which Andre is writing the music for.

Despite putting a lot of effort into it, she fails twice. As well as this, she must also think of a creative and meaningful way to decorate her locker, which is Hollywood Arts tradition, but all her efforts are unsuccessful as well. She again performs \"The Bird Scene\" and indignantly states that she is proud of her own work no matter what anyone thinks. She passes, as the secret of \"The Bird Scene\" is to be proud of one's acting style. Inspired, Tori decorates her locker with the glowing words \"Make It Shine\", as that was the song that she sang that got her into Hollywood Arts. Andre and Robbie sign up for ballet class as a way to meet girls, but arrive only to see an all-male class, They want to drop out, but they must continue the class unless they want to fail the semester.

Tori is roped into helping Trina and her project partner Andre Harris ([[Leon Thomas III]]) prepare for their performance for the showcase in a few days, including Trina singing a song Andre wrote for her. When Trina's tongue becomes swollen and she cannot sing properly, Andre tells Tori to fill in for Trina, but she refuses. They force her on stage and, with the help of Andre, Tori receives a [[standing ovation]] from the crowd, and accepts the offer to join Hollywood Arts. On her first day, she meets [[Cat Valentine (Victorious)|Cat Valentine]] ([[Ariana Grande]]), a girl who seems to be living in her own head, Robbie Shapiro ([[Matt Bennett]]), an awkward, nerdy student who speaks through his dummy Rex Powers, handsome Beck Oliver ([[Avan Jogia]]), and his mean girlfriend Jade West ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]). After accidentally spilling coffee on Beck and trying to wipe the stain off his shirt, Tori finds herself at the wrath of Jade, who thinks that Tori is flirting with Beck. Jade does an improv scene with Tori, having Tori portray a dog, but then takes iced coffee and spills it on top of Tori, causing her to leave the room in humiliation. After the altercation with Jade, Tori wonders if she is good enough for, or even belongs at Hollywood Arts. At the insistence of Trina and Andre, who tell her not to let a mean girl crush her confidence, Tori returns to class and subsequently gets revenge on Jade by besting her in an improv assignment and then by kissing Beck in front of her.\n\n''Song featured:'' \"Make It Shine\" (performed by Victoria Justice), which becomes the series' theme song.\n| LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 2\n| EpisodeNumber2= 2\n| Title= The Bird Scene\n| DirectedBy= Steve Hoefer\n| WrittenBy= Dan Schneider\n| OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2010|4|11}}\n| ProdCode= 102\n| Aux4= 3.5<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/13/nickelodeons-victorious-tops-basic-cable-in-total-viewers-in-time-slot-with-3-5-million/48204 Nickelodeon's Victorious Tops Basic Cable In Total Viewers In Time Slot With 3.5 Million] Posted on 13 April 2010 by Bill Gorman of TVbythenumbers.com</ref>\n| ShortSummary= Tori wants to try out for the lead role in a play called \"Moonlight Magic\", which Andre is writing the music for.

Despite putting a lot of effort into it, she fails twice. As well as this, she must also think of a creative and meaningful way to decorate her locker, which is Hollywood Arts tradition, but all her efforts are unsuccessful as well. She again performs \"The Bird Scene\" and indignantly states that she is proud of her own work no matter what anyone thinks. She passes, as the secret of \"The Bird Scene\" is to be proud of one's acting style. Inspired, Tori decorates her locker with the glowing words \"Make It Shine\", as that was the song that she sang that got her into Hollywood Arts. Andre and Robbie sign up for ballet class as a way to meet girls, but arrive only to see an all-male class, They want to drop out, but they must continue the class unless they want to fail the semester.

At Nozu, Cat meets a cute boy named Evan on her way to the bathroom. After talking to him for five hours, she forgets to tell him that she actually has red hair and brown eyes. Tori and Robbie tell her that she is beautiful, and when Cat talks to Robbie about Evan, Robbie gets jealous. During lunch, Jade checks Evan's SplashFace profile, and shows that all of his ex-girlfriends are blondes, revealing that he prefers blonde girls, and dislikes people not being themselves. Robbie has a sudden outburst and professes that Cat is adorable and any guy would be lucky to go out with her. On the night of the premiere of Beck's movie, Jade and Tori expect Cat to be herself, but Cat walks in to meet Evan wearing her blonde wig and blue contacts. During the movie, Andre's grandmother's pet bird lands on Cat's wig, and begins to shift it out of place. Beck pauses the movie as Cat runs out of the theater, followed by Tori and Robbie. Tori forces Cat to show her true self to Evan, convincing her that he will like her as herself. Cat then shows Evan her real hair color. Evan tells her she is beautiful, but he likes blondes and leaves her. Cat, heartbroken, does not appreciate Tori's advice, but Robbie performs his song \"I Think You're Swell\" to Cat in the end. However, she only responds by saying that maybe she should dye her hair blonde, which leaves Robbie exasperated.

Romney]]. A Gallup poll in mid-1967 showed Nixon with 39%, followed by Romney with 25%. However, in a [[Freudian slip|slip of the tongue]], Romney told a news reporter that he had been \"brainwashed\" by the military and the [[diplomatic corps]] into supporting the Vietnam War; the remark led to weeks of ridicule in the national [[news media]]. As the year 1968 opened, Romney was opposed to further American intervention in Vietnam and had decided to run as the Republican version of [[Eugene McCarthy]] (''[[The New York Times]]'' 2/18/1968). Romney's support slowly faded and he withdrew from the race on February 28, 1968. (''[[The New York Times]]'' 2/29/1968).\n\nNixon won a resounding victory in the important New Hampshire primary on March 12, winning 78% of the vote. Anti-war Republicans wrote in the name of [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the GOP's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote and became Nixon's new challenger. Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign. Rockefeller defeated Nixon in the [[Massachusetts]] primary on April 30 but otherwise fared poorly in the state primaries and conventions.\n\nBy early spring, [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]], the leader of the GOP's conservative wing, had become Nixon's chief rival. In the [[Nebraska]] primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, [[Oregon]], on May 15 with 65% of the vote and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's margin in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but when the Republican National Convention assembled, Nixon had 656 delegates according to a [[UPI]] poll (with 667 needed for the nomination).\n\nFour candidates won states in the primary, a record not equaled in Republican primaries until [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016]] when four candidates ([[Donald Trump]], [[Ted Cruz]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[John Kasich]]) won at least one state. (However, in [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012]], three candidates ([[Mitt Romney]], [[Rick Santorum]], and [[Newt Gingrich]]) won states and a fourth ([[Ron Paul]]) won a contest in a territory, the [[Virgin Islands]].  For comparison, the 1968 Democratic primary saw five candidates win states.\n\nTotal popular vote\n\n* [[Ronald Reagan]] \u2013 1,696,632 (37.93%)\n* [[Richard Nixon]] \u2013 1,679,443 (37.54%)\n* [[James A.

Nixon won the nomination on the first ballot. Nixon then chose [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Spiro Agnew]] to be his [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-Presidential]] candidate, despite complaints from within the GOP that Agnew was an unknown quantity, and that a better-known and more popular candidate, such as Romney, should have been the Vice-Presidential nominee. \nIt was also reported that Nixon's first choice for running mate was his longtime friend and ally, [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], who was Lt. Governor of California since 1967 and later his HEW Secretary, but Finch declined the offer and, in any case, had he run he would have put the Republican ticket at a disadvantage as the Constitution prevents a member of the Electoral College from voting for both President and Vice-President from the Elector's home state.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+The Republican Convention Tally{{sfn|Troy|Schlesinger|Israel|2012|pp=1318-1319}}\n|-\n!

Romney]]. A Gallup poll in mid-1967 showed Nixon with 39%, followed by Romney with 25%. However, in a [[Freudian slip|slip of the tongue]], Romney told a news reporter that he had been \"brainwashed\" by the military and the [[diplomatic corps]] into supporting the Vietnam War; the remark led to weeks of ridicule in the national [[news media]]. As the year 1968 opened, Romney was opposed to further American intervention in Vietnam and had decided to run as the Republican version of [[Eugene McCarthy]] (''[[The New York Times]]'' 2/18/1968). Romney's support slowly faded and he withdrew from the race on February 28, 1968. (''[[The New York Times]]'' 2/29/1968).\n\nNixon won a resounding victory in the important New Hampshire primary on March 12, winning 78% of the vote. Anti-war Republicans wrote in the name of [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the GOP's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote and became Nixon's new challenger. Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign. Rockefeller defeated Nixon in the [[Massachusetts]] primary on April 30 but otherwise fared poorly in the state primaries and conventions.\n\nBy early spring, [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]], the leader of the GOP's conservative wing, had become Nixon's chief rival. In the [[Nebraska]] primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, [[Oregon]], on May 15 with 65% of the vote and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's margin in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but when the Republican National Convention assembled, Nixon had 656 delegates according to a [[UPI]] poll (with 667 needed for the nomination).\n\nFour candidates won states in the primary, a record not equaled in Republican primaries until [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016]] when four candidates ([[Donald Trump]], [[Ted Cruz]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[John Kasich]]) won at least one state. (However, in [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012]], three candidates ([[Mitt Romney]], [[Rick Santorum]], and [[Newt Gingrich]]) won states and a fourth ([[Ron Paul]]) won a contest in a territory, the [[Virgin Islands]].  For comparison, the 1968 Democratic primary saw five candidates win states.\n\nTotal popular vote\n\n* [[Ronald Reagan]] \u2013 1,696,632 (37.93%)\n* [[Richard Nixon]] \u2013 1,679,443 (37.54%)\n* [[James A.

Nixon won the nomination on the first ballot. Nixon then chose [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Spiro Agnew]] to be his [[Vice President of the United States|Vice-Presidential]] candidate, despite complaints from within the GOP that Agnew was an unknown quantity, and that a better-known and more popular candidate, such as Romney, should have been the Vice-Presidential nominee. \nIt was also reported that Nixon's first choice for running mate was his longtime friend and ally, [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], who was Lt. Governor of California since 1967 and later his HEW Secretary, but Finch declined the offer and, in any case, had he run he would have put the Republican ticket at a disadvantage as the Constitution prevents a member of the Electoral College from voting for both President and Vice-President from the Elector's home state.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+The Republican Convention Tally{{sfn|Troy|Schlesinger|Israel|2012|pp=1318-1319}}\n|-\n!

The Baltimore-based B&O also used the name between 1890 and 1917 for its improved passenger service between New York and Washington launched in the 1890s, collectively dubbed the '''''Royal Blue Line'''''. Using variants such as the ''Royal Limited'' and ''Royal Special'' for individual ''Royal Blue'' trains, the B&O operated the service in partnership with the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]] and the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]. Principal intermediate cities served were [[Philadelphia]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], and [[Baltimore]]. Later, as Europe reeled from the carnage of World War I and connotations of European royalty fell into disfavor, the B&O discreetly omitted the sobriquet ''Royal Blue Line'' from its New York passenger service and the ''Royal Blue'' disappeared from B&O timetables. Beginning in 1917, former ''Royal Blue Line'' trains were renamed: the ''Royal Limited'' (inaugurated on May 15, 1898), for example, became the ''[[National Limited]]'', continuing west from Washington to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] via [[Cincinnati]]. During the [[Great Depression|Depression]], the B&O hearkened back to the halcyon pre-World War I era when it launched a re-christened ''Royal Blue'' train between New York and Washington in 1935. The B&O finally discontinued all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958, including the ''Royal Blue''.\n\nRailroad historian Herbert Harwood said, in his seminal history of the service, \"First conceived in late Victorian times to promote a new railroad line&nbsp;... it was indeed one of the most memorable images in the transportation business, an inspired blend of majesty and mystique&nbsp;...

The Baltimore-based B&O also used the name between 1890 and 1917 for its improved passenger service between New York and Washington launched in the 1890s, collectively dubbed the '''''Royal Blue Line'''''. Using variants such as the ''Royal Limited'' and ''Royal Special'' for individual ''Royal Blue'' trains, the B&O operated the service in partnership with the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]] and the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]. Principal intermediate cities served were [[Philadelphia]], [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], and [[Baltimore]]. Later, as Europe reeled from the carnage of World War I and connotations of European royalty fell into disfavor, the B&O discreetly omitted the sobriquet ''Royal Blue Line'' from its New York passenger service and the ''Royal Blue'' disappeared from B&O timetables. Beginning in 1917, former ''Royal Blue Line'' trains were renamed: the ''Royal Limited'' (inaugurated on May 15, 1898), for example, became the ''[[National Limited]]'', continuing west from Washington to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] via [[Cincinnati]]. During the [[Great Depression|Depression]], the B&O hearkened back to the halcyon pre-World War I era when it launched a re-christened ''Royal Blue'' train between New York and Washington in 1935. The B&O finally discontinued all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958, including the ''Royal Blue''.\n\nRailroad historian Herbert Harwood said, in his seminal history of the service, \"First conceived in late Victorian times to promote a new railroad line&nbsp;... it was indeed one of the most memorable images in the transportation business, an inspired blend of majesty and mystique&nbsp;...

On the river [[Trave]], it was the leading city of the [[Hanseatic League]], and because of its extensive [[Brick Gothic]] architecture, it is listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. In 2015, it had a population of 218,523.\n\nThe old part of L\u00fcbeck is on an island enclosed by the Trave. The [[Elbe\u2013L\u00fcbeck Canal]] connects the Trave with the [[Elbe]] River. Another important river near the town centre is the [[Wakenitz]]. [[Bundesautobahn 1|Autobahn 1]] connects L\u00fcbeck with [[Hamburg]] and [[Denmark]]. [[Travem\u00fcnde]] is a sea resort and ferry port on the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]]. [[L\u00fcbeck Hauptbahnhof]] links L\u00fcbeck to a number of railway lines, notably the [[L\u00fcbeck\u2013Hamburg railway|line to Hamburg]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Liubice|Free City of L\u00fcbeck|Timeline of L\u00fcbeck}}\nHumans settled in the area around what today is L\u00fcbeck after the [[Weichselian glaciation|last Ice Age]] ended about 9700 BCE. Several [[Neolithic]] [[dolmen]]s can be found in the area.\n\nAround AD 700, [[Slavic people]]s started moving into the eastern parts of [[Holstein]], an area previously settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic inhabitants]] who had moved on in the [[Migration Period]]. [[Charlemagne]] (Holy Roman Emperor 800\u2013814), whose efforts to [[Christianisation|Christianise]] the area were opposed by the Germanic [[Saxons]], expelled many of the Saxons and brought in [[Polabian Slavs]] allies. [[Liubice]] (the place-name means \"lovely\") was founded on the banks of the River Trave about  {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} north of the present-day city-center of L\u00fcbeck. In the 10th century, it became the most important settlement of the [[Obotrites|Obotrite confederacy]] and a castle was built. In 1128, the pagan [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] from [[R\u00fcgen]] razed Liubice.\n\nIn 1143, [[Adolf II of Holstein|Adolf II]], Count of Schauenburg and Holstein, founded the modern town as a German settlement on the river island of [[Bucu]].  He built a new castle, first mentioned by the chronicler [[Helmold]] as existing in 1147.  Adolf had to cede the castle to the Duke of Saxony, [[Henry the Lion]], in 1158.  After Henry's fall from power in 1181, the town became an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial city]] for eight years.{{citation needed |date=March 2011}} Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]] (reigned 1152\u20131190) ordained that the city should have a ruling council of 20 members.  With the council dominated by merchants, pragmatic trade interests shaped L\u00fcbeck's politics for centuries.  The council survived into the 19th century.

The city remained neutral in the [[Thirty Years' War]] of 1618\u20131648, but the combination of the devastation from the decades-long war and the new transatlantic orientation of European trade caused the Hanseatic League \u2013 and thus L\u00fcbeck with it \u2013 to decline in importance. However, even after the ''de facto'' disbanding of the Hanseatic League in 1669, L\u00fcbeck still remained an important trading town on the Baltic Sea.\n\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 265-66 (Lubeca).jpg|thumb|left|L\u00fcbeck in 1493]]\n\n=== Old traditions, new challenges ===\nFranz Tunder was the organist in the Marienkirche. It was part of the tradition in this Lutheran congregation that the organist would pass on the duty in a dynastic marriage. In 1668, his daughter Anna Margarethe married the great Danish-German composer [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], who was the organist at the [[Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck|Marienkirche]] in L\u00fcbeck until at least 1703. Some of the greatest composers of the day came to the church to hear his renowned playing.\n\nIn the course of the war of the [[Fourth Coalition]] against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], troops under [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]] (who would later become King of Sweden) occupied the neutral L\u00fcbeck after a battle against [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]] on 6 November 1806. Under the [[Continental System]], the State bank went into bankruptcy. In 1811, the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] formally annexed L\u00fcbeck as part of France; the anti-Napoleonic allies liberated the area in 1813, and the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 recognised L\u00fcbeck as an independent free city.\n\nWriter [[Thomas Mann]] was a member of the [[Mann family]] of L\u00fcbeck merchants. His well-known 1901 novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'' made readers in Germany (and later worldwide, through numerous translations) familiar with the manner of life and mores of the 19th-century L\u00fcbeck ''[[bourgeoisie]]''.\n\n[[File:Lubeka kolorowa litografia ksi\u0105\u017ckowa XIVw.jpg|thumb|L\u00fcbeck, 16th century]]\n\n[[File:Luebeck-1641-Merian.jpg|thumb|L\u00fcbeck in 1641]]\n\nIn 1937, the [[Nazi]]s passed the so-called [[Greater Hamburg Act]], which merged the city of L\u00fcbeck with Prussia.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945), L\u00fcbeck became the first German city to suffer substantial [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombing. The attack of 28 March 1942 created a [[firestorm]] that caused severe damage to the historic centre. [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|This raid]] destroyed three of the main churches and large parts of the built-up area; the bells of St Marienkircke plunged to the stone floor.<ref name=\"luebeck-tourism.de\">http://www.luebeck-tourism.de/discover/sights/churches-in-luebeck/st-marys.html</ref> Germany operated a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] for officers, [[Oflag X-C]], near the city from 1940 until April 1945. The British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] entered L\u00fcbeck on 2 May 1945 and occupied it without resistance.\n\nOn 3 May 1945, one of the biggest disasters in naval history occurred in the [[Bay of L\u00fcbeck]] when RAF bombers sank three ships: the [[SS Cap Arcona|SS ''Cap Arcona'']], the [[SS Deutschland (1923)|SS ''Deutschland'']], and the [[SS Thielbek (1940)|SS ''Thielbek'']] \u2013 which, unknown to them, were packed with concentration-camp inmates. About 7,000 people died.\n\nL\u00fcbeck's population grew considerably, from about 150,000 in 1939 to more than 220,000 after the war, owing to an influx of ethnic German refugees expelled from the so-called [[Historical Eastern Germany|former eastern provinces]] of Germany in the [[Communist Bloc]]. L\u00fcbeck remained part of Schleswig-Holstein after World War II (and consequently lay within [[West Germany]]). It stood directly on what became the [[inner German border]] during the division of Germany into two states in the [[Cold War]] period. South of the city, the border followed the path of the river [[Wakenitz]], which separated the Germanys by less than {{convert|10|m|2|abbr=on}} in many parts. The northernmost border crossing was in L\u00fcbeck's district of Schlutup. L\u00fcbeck spent decades restoring its historic city centre. In 1987, [[UNESCO]] designated this area a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\nL\u00fcbeck became the scene of a notable art scandal in the 1950s. [[Lothar Malskat]] was hired to restore the medieval [[fresco]]es of the cathedral of the Marienkirche, which were discovered after the cathedral had been badly damaged during World War II. Instead, he painted new works, which he passed off as restorations, fooling many experts. Malskat later revealed the deception himself. [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] featured this incident in his 1986 novel ''[[The Rat (novel)|The Rat]]''.\n\n[[File:HL Damals \u2013 Hafenstra\u00dfe 52.jpg|thumb|The house after the fire]] \nOn the night of 18 January 1996, a fire broke out in a home for foreign refugees, killing 10 people and severely injuring more than 30 others, mostly children.

L\u00fcbeck is famous for its medieval City Center with the Churches, the [[Holstentor]], its small alleys and so much more. L\u00fcbeck has been called \"Die Stadt der 7 T\u00fcrme\" (The City of seven Towers) due to its seven prominent church towers.\n\nA typical visit in L\u00fcbeck includes a walk through the medieval city centre to see the Holstentor, the famous Churches like St. Mary's Church, and the town hall. L\u00fcbeck is also very famous for marzipan. This almond treat has been a part of L\u00fcbeck's history since 1806, and amongst its most famous producers is \"[[Niederegger]]\". For many people the Niederegger coffee shop in the city centre is a significant tourist attraction: it offers more than 25 variety of pie and all things marzipan. At night time, there are lots of bars, clubs and restaurants to finish the day.\n\nAlso very popular is the city of Travem\u00fcnde on the Baltic Sea. In summer there are thousands of people on the white sanded beach. Here you can watch the huge ferries and cruiseships coming in and leaving the port to Scandinavia.\n\nMost tourists stay for a week and visit places nearby such as the cities of Hamburg, Schwerin, Wismar or Rostock, the seaside resorts Timmendorfer Strand, Scharbeutz, Gr\u00f6mitz or Boltenhagen, going on a cycling tour on the coast of the Baltic Sea, the Hansa-Park amusement park, the SeaLife Center in Timmendorf, the Island of Fehmarn, and some even on a day trip to Denmark.\n\n===Buildings===\n\nMuch of the old town has kept a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] appearance with old buildings and narrow streets. At one time, the town could only be entered by any of four [[City gate|town gates]], two of which remain today, the well-known [[Holstentor]] (1478) and the [[Burgtor]] (1444).\n\nThe old town centre is dominated by seven church steeples. The oldest are the [[L\u00fcbeck Cathedral|L\u00fcbecker Dom]] (the city's cathedral) and the [[Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck|Marienkirche]] (Saint Mary's), both from the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nBuilt in 1286, the Holy Spirit Hospital at Koberg is one of the oldest existing social institutions in the world and one of the most important buildings in the city. The Holy Spirit Hospital is in parts an old-folk and nursing home. Historic parts can be visited.\n\nOther sights include:\n*the [[L\u00fcbecker Rathaus]] (Town Hall)\n*[[St. Catherine's Church, L\u00fcbeck|St. Catherine's Church]], a church that belonged to a former monastery, now the [[Katharineum]], a [[Latin school]]\n*[[Thomas Mann]]'s house\n*[[G\u00fcnter Grass]]' house\n*Church of St Peter [[Petrikirche (L\u00fcbeck)]]\n*Church of St Lawrence, located on the site of a cemetery for people who died during the 16th-century plague\n*Church of St Jacob [[L\u00fcbecker Jakobikirche]], 1334\n*[[Sacred Heart Church, L\u00fcbeck|Church of the Sacred Heart]] (''Propsteikirche Herz Jesu'')\n*[[Aegidienkirche (L\u00fcbeck)|Church of St Aegidien]]\n*the [[Salzspeicher]], historic warehouses where salt delivered from [[L\u00fcneburg]] awaited shipment to Baltic ports\n*The City of [[Travem\u00fcnde]] on the Coast of the Baltic Sea.\n\nLike many other places in Germany, L\u00fcbeck has a long tradition of a Christmas market in December, which includes the famous handicrafts market inside the Heiligen-Geist-Hospital (Hospital of the Holy Spirit), located at the northern end of K\u00f6nigstrasse.\n\n===Museums===\n\nL\u00fcbeck has many small museums, such as the [[St. Anne's Museum Quarter, L\u00fcbeck]], the [[Behnhaus]], the [[European Hansemuseum]], and the [[Holstentor]]. [[L\u00fcbeck Museum of Theatre Puppets]] is a privately run museum. Waterside attractions are a [[lightvessel]] that served [[Fehmarnbelt]] and the [[Lisa von L\u00fcbeck]], a reconstruction of a Hanseatic 15th century [[caravel]].\nThe marzipan museum in the second floor of Caf\u00e9 [[Niederegger]] in Breite Strasse explains the history of [[marzipan]], and shows historical wood molds for the production of marzipan blocks and a group of historical figures made of marzipan.\n\n==Food and drink==\n\nL\u00fcbeck is famous for its [[marzipan]] industry.  According to local legend, marzipan was first made in L\u00fcbeck, possibly in response either to a military siege of the city or a famine year. The story, perhaps apocryphal, is that the town ran out of all food except stored almonds and sugar, which were used to make loaves of marzipan \"bread\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sacirbey|first1=Omar|title=A culinary treasure in marzipan in Lubeck, Germany|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2012/06/05/culinary-treasure-marzipan-lubeck-germany/yXAQBv8ToolzANzVryNacO/story.html|accessdate=18 May 2017|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=6 Jun 2012}}</ref>  Others believe that marzipan was actually invented in [[Iran|Persia]] a few hundred years before L\u00fcbeck claims to have invented it.

On the river [[Trave]], it was the leading city of the [[Hanseatic League]], and because of its extensive [[Brick Gothic]] architecture, it is listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. In 2015, it had a population of 218,523.\n\nThe old part of L\u00fcbeck is on an island enclosed by the Trave. The [[Elbe\u2013L\u00fcbeck Canal]] connects the Trave with the [[Elbe]] River. Another important river near the town centre is the [[Wakenitz]]. [[Bundesautobahn 1|Autobahn 1]] connects L\u00fcbeck with [[Hamburg]] and [[Denmark]]. [[Travem\u00fcnde]] is a sea resort and ferry port on the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]].

Several [[Neolithic]] [[dolmen]]s can be found in the area.\n\nAround AD 700, [[Slavic people]]s started moving into the eastern parts of [[Holstein]], an area previously settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic inhabitants]] who had moved on in the [[Migration Period]]. [[Charlemagne]] (Holy Roman Emperor 800\u2013814), whose efforts to [[Christianisation|Christianise]] the area were opposed by the Germanic [[Saxons]], expelled many of the Saxons and brought in [[Polabian Slavs]] allies. [[Liubice]] (the place-name means \"lovely\") was founded on the banks of the River Trave about  {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} north of the present-day city-center of L\u00fcbeck. In the 10th century, it became the most important settlement of the [[Obotrites|Obotrite confederacy]] and a castle was built. In 1128, the pagan [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Rani]] from [[R\u00fcgen]] razed Liubice.\n\nIn 1143, [[Adolf II of Holstein|Adolf II]], Count of Schauenburg and Holstein, founded the modern town as a German settlement on the river island of [[Bucu]].  He built a new castle, first mentioned by the chronicler [[Helmold]] as existing in 1147.  Adolf had to cede the castle to the Duke of Saxony, [[Henry the Lion]], in 1158.  After Henry's fall from power in 1181, the town became an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial city]] for eight years.{{citation needed |date=March 2011}} Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]] (reigned 1152\u20131190) ordained that the city should have a ruling council of 20 members.  With the council dominated by merchants, pragmatic trade interests shaped L\u00fcbeck's politics for centuries.  The council survived into the 19th century.  The town and castle changed ownership for a period afterwards and formed part of the [[Duchy of Saxony]] until 1192, of the County of [[Holstein]] until 1217, and of the kingdom of [[Denmark]] until the [[Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved (1227)|Battle of Bornh\u00f6ved]] in 1227.\n\n[[File:Stadssigill foer staden Luebeck.png|thumb|left|upright|L\u00fcbeck's seal, 1280]]\n\n=== Hanseatic city ===\nAround 1200, the port became the main point of departure for colonists leaving for the Baltic territories conquered by the [[Livonian Order]], and later, by the [[Teutonic Order]].

The city remained neutral in the [[Thirty Years' War]] of 1618\u20131648, but the combination of the devastation from the decades-long war and the new transatlantic orientation of European trade caused the Hanseatic League \u2013 and thus L\u00fcbeck with it \u2013 to decline in importance. However, even after the ''de facto'' disbanding of the Hanseatic League in 1669, L\u00fcbeck still remained an important trading town on the Baltic Sea.\n\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 265-66 (Lubeca).jpg|thumb|left|L\u00fcbeck in 1493]]\n\n=== Old traditions, new challenges ===\nFranz Tunder was the organist in the Marienkirche. It was part of the tradition in this Lutheran congregation that the organist would pass on the duty in a dynastic marriage. In 1668, his daughter Anna Margarethe married the great Danish-German composer [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], who was the organist at the [[Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck|Marienkirche]] in L\u00fcbeck until at least 1703. Some of the greatest composers of the day came to the church to hear his renowned playing.\n\nIn the course of the war of the [[Fourth Coalition]] against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], troops under [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]] (who would later become King of Sweden) occupied the neutral L\u00fcbeck after a battle against [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]] on 6 November 1806. Under the [[Continental System]], the State bank went into bankruptcy. In 1811, the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] formally annexed L\u00fcbeck as part of France; the anti-Napoleonic allies liberated the area in 1813, and the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 recognised L\u00fcbeck as an independent free city.\n\nWriter [[Thomas Mann]] was a member of the [[Mann family]] of L\u00fcbeck merchants. His well-known 1901 novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'' made readers in Germany (and later worldwide, through numerous translations) familiar with the manner of life and mores of the 19th-century L\u00fcbeck ''[[bourgeoisie]]''.\n\n[[File:Lubeka kolorowa litografia ksi\u0105\u017ckowa XIVw.jpg|thumb|L\u00fcbeck, 16th century]]\n\n[[File:Luebeck-1641-Merian.jpg|thumb|L\u00fcbeck in 1641]]\n\nIn 1937, the [[Nazi]]s passed the so-called [[Greater Hamburg Act]], which merged the city of L\u00fcbeck with Prussia.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945), L\u00fcbeck became the first German city to suffer substantial [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombing. The attack of 28 March 1942 created a [[firestorm]] that caused severe damage to the historic centre. [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|This raid]] destroyed three of the main churches and large parts of the built-up area; the bells of St Marienkircke plunged to the stone floor.<ref name=\"luebeck-tourism.de\">http://www.luebeck-tourism.de/discover/sights/churches-in-luebeck/st-marys.html</ref> Germany operated a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] for officers, [[Oflag X-C]], near the city from 1940 until April 1945. The British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] entered L\u00fcbeck on 2 May 1945 and occupied it without resistance.\n\nOn 3 May 1945, one of the biggest disasters in naval history occurred in the [[Bay of L\u00fcbeck]] when RAF bombers sank three ships: the [[SS Cap Arcona|SS ''Cap Arcona'']], the [[SS Deutschland (1923)|SS ''Deutschland'']], and the [[SS Thielbek (1940)|SS ''Thielbek'']] \u2013 which, unknown to them, were packed with concentration-camp inmates. About 7,000 people died.\n\nL\u00fcbeck's population grew considerably, from about 150,000 in 1939 to more than 220,000 after the war, owing to an influx of ethnic German refugees expelled from the so-called [[Historical Eastern Germany|former eastern provinces]] of Germany in the [[Communist Bloc]]. L\u00fcbeck remained part of Schleswig-Holstein after World War II (and consequently lay within [[West Germany]]). It stood directly on what became the [[inner German border]] during the division of Germany into two states in the [[Cold War]] period. South of the city, the border followed the path of the river [[Wakenitz]], which separated the Germanys by less than {{convert|10|m|2|abbr=on}} in many parts. The northernmost border crossing was in L\u00fcbeck's district of Schlutup. L\u00fcbeck spent decades restoring its historic city centre. In 1987, [[UNESCO]] designated this area a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\nL\u00fcbeck became the scene of a notable art scandal in the 1950s. [[Lothar Malskat]] was hired to restore the medieval [[fresco]]es of the cathedral of the Marienkirche, which were discovered after the cathedral had been badly damaged during World War II. Instead, he painted new works, which he passed off as restorations, fooling many experts. Malskat later revealed the deception himself. [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] featured this incident in his 1986 novel ''[[The Rat (novel)|The Rat]]''.\n\n[[File:HL Damals \u2013 Hafenstra\u00dfe 52.jpg|thumb|The house after the fire]] \nOn the night of 18 January 1996, a fire broke out in a home for foreign refugees, killing 10 people and severely injuring more than 30 others, mostly children.

L\u00fcbeck is famous for its medieval City Center with the Churches, the [[Holstentor]], its small alleys and so much more. L\u00fcbeck has been called \"Die Stadt der 7 T\u00fcrme\" (The City of seven Towers) due to its seven prominent church towers.\n\nA typical visit in L\u00fcbeck includes a walk through the medieval city centre to see the Holstentor, the famous Churches like St. Mary's Church, and the town hall. L\u00fcbeck is also very famous for marzipan. This almond treat has been a part of L\u00fcbeck's history since 1806, and amongst its most famous producers is \"[[Niederegger]]\". For many people the Niederegger coffee shop in the city centre is a significant tourist attraction: it offers more than 25 variety of pie and all things marzipan. At night time, there are lots of bars, clubs and restaurants to finish the day.\n\nAlso very popular is the city of Travem\u00fcnde on the Baltic Sea. In summer there are thousands of people on the white sanded beach. Here you can watch the huge ferries and cruiseships coming in and leaving the port to Scandinavia.\n\nMost tourists stay for a week and visit places nearby such as the cities of Hamburg, Schwerin, Wismar or Rostock, the seaside resorts Timmendorfer Strand, Scharbeutz, Gr\u00f6mitz or Boltenhagen, going on a cycling tour on the coast of the Baltic Sea, the Hansa-Park amusement park, the SeaLife Center in Timmendorf, the Island of Fehmarn, and some even on a day trip to Denmark.\n\n===Buildings===\n\nMuch of the old town has kept a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] appearance with old buildings and narrow streets. At one time, the town could only be entered by any of four [[City gate|town gates]], two of which remain today, the well-known [[Holstentor]] (1478) and the [[Burgtor]] (1444).\n\nThe old town centre is dominated by seven church steeples. The oldest are the [[L\u00fcbeck Cathedral|L\u00fcbecker Dom]] (the city's cathedral) and the [[Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck|Marienkirche]] (Saint Mary's), both from the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nBuilt in 1286, the Holy Spirit Hospital at Koberg is one of the oldest existing social institutions in the world and one of the most important buildings in the city. The Holy Spirit Hospital is in parts an old-folk and nursing home. Historic parts can be visited.\n\nOther sights include:\n*the [[L\u00fcbecker Rathaus]] (Town Hall)\n*[[St. Catherine's Church, L\u00fcbeck|St. Catherine's Church]], a church that belonged to a former monastery, now the [[Katharineum]], a [[Latin school]]\n*[[Thomas Mann]]'s house\n*[[G\u00fcnter Grass]]' house\n*Church of St Peter [[Petrikirche (L\u00fcbeck)]]\n*Church of St Lawrence, located on the site of a cemetery for people who died during the 16th-century plague\n*Church of St Jacob [[L\u00fcbecker Jakobikirche]], 1334\n*[[Sacred Heart Church, L\u00fcbeck|Church of the Sacred Heart]] (''Propsteikirche Herz Jesu'')\n*[[Aegidienkirche (L\u00fcbeck)|Church of St Aegidien]]\n*the [[Salzspeicher]], historic warehouses where salt delivered from [[L\u00fcneburg]] awaited shipment to Baltic ports\n*The City of [[Travem\u00fcnde]] on the Coast of the Baltic Sea.\n\nLike many other places in Germany, L\u00fcbeck has a long tradition of a Christmas market in December, which includes the famous handicrafts market inside the Heiligen-Geist-Hospital (Hospital of the Holy Spirit), located at the northern end of K\u00f6nigstrasse.\n\n===Museums===\n\nL\u00fcbeck has many small museums, such as the [[St. Anne's Museum Quarter, L\u00fcbeck]], the [[Behnhaus]], the [[European Hansemuseum]], and the [[Holstentor]]. [[L\u00fcbeck Museum of Theatre Puppets]] is a privately run museum. Waterside attractions are a [[lightvessel]] that served [[Fehmarnbelt]] and the [[Lisa von L\u00fcbeck]], a reconstruction of a Hanseatic 15th century [[caravel]].\nThe marzipan museum in the second floor of Caf\u00e9 [[Niederegger]] in Breite Strasse explains the history of [[marzipan]], and shows historical wood molds for the production of marzipan blocks and a group of historical figures made of marzipan.\n\n==Food and drink==\n\nL\u00fcbeck is famous for its [[marzipan]] industry.  According to local legend, marzipan was first made in L\u00fcbeck, possibly in response either to a military siege of the city or a famine year. The story, perhaps apocryphal, is that the town ran out of all food except stored almonds and sugar, which were used to make loaves of marzipan \"bread\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sacirbey|first1=Omar|title=A culinary treasure in marzipan in Lubeck, Germany|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2012/06/05/culinary-treasure-marzipan-lubeck-germany/yXAQBv8ToolzANzVryNacO/story.html|accessdate=18 May 2017|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=6 Jun 2012}}</ref>  Others believe that marzipan was actually invented in [[Iran|Persia]] a few hundred years before L\u00fcbeck claims to have invented it.

It began in 1999 as a series of three-minute shorts and later ran for a season of full-length episodes spanning 21 minutes each. It chronicles the small-scale adventures and discoveries of a three-year-old puppet girl named Mona in her grandmother Nana Bea's backyard. The title is a contraction of the phrase \"Nana Land,\" referring to the setting.\n\nHopley and Shannon, who continued to work with Nickelodeon afterwards on their creation ''[[Mr. Meaty]]'', produced the series through their puppetry troupe [[The Grogs]] in association with [[Jack Lenz|Lenz Entertainment]]. The show uses a blend of hand puppetry and the manipulation of cardboard cutouts, particularly in the opening theme. While the shorts do not follow a structure, the half-hour episodes follow a loose format that includes at least one song and reading an original story to the viewers.\n\nThe show received three nominations at the 2004 [[Gemini Awards]] and was fairly well-received by Canadian and U.S. press, with some critics calling attention to the show's surreal presentation and genuine approach to its concept. It was short-lived, as Nickelodeon did not pick up a second season. In 2004, select episodes were released across several [[DVD]]s in the United States. In 2015, the series [[viral phenomenon|went viral]] with a resurgence in popularity on websites such as [[Tumblr]] and [[YouTube]] for its bizarre nature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Tanya|title=Teens On Tumblr Are Obsessed With This Fucked Up Canadian Kids Show|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tanyachen/nanalan-why|website=Buzzfeed|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bobkin|first1=Matt|title=Canadian kids\u2019 show Nanalan\u2019 goes viral, validates weirdness of Canadian millennials|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/television/canadian-kids-show-nanalan-goes-viral-validates-weirdness-of-canadian-millennials|website=National Post|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show focuses on Mona, a three-year-old girl with a big imagination and a tendency to repeat short words or phrases while also pronouncing them incorrectly. Each episode begins with Mona's mother dropping her daughter off at Nana's house and ends with her picking Mona up. Mona, Nana, and Nana's pet dog Russell spend the day exploring, learning, and visiting Nana's next-door neighbour Mr. Wooka.\n\n==Characters==\n*Mona ([[Jamie Shannon]]) is the main character. She is a humanoid three-year-old with green skin, a spherical head, wide bean-shaped eyes, and lime green hair tied into pigtails. In the original shorts, she cannot speak in full sentences and can only say a few words. She tends to mispronounce everything she says; for example, she says ''pea pod'' as \"peepo\" and ''mushroom'' as \"shoosh.\"\n*Nana ([[The Grogs|Jason Hopley]]) is Mona's grandmother, whom she stays with every weekday while her mother goes to work. She resembles a carrot, with bright orange skin and a very tall forehead. She wears a gaudy multicolored dress, big circular glasses, and a white wig. In the original shorts, her hair was dark red-orange.\n*Russell ([[Ali Eisner]]) is Nana's pet [[Jack Russell Terrier]] dog who accompanies Mona when she visits. He does not talk and only barks or sniffs to communicate. Mona cannot pronounce his name correctly and always calls him \"Russer.\"\n*Mr. Wooka ([[Todd Doldersum]]) is Nana's next-door neighbor who is a main character in the full-length episodes. He is an elderly man with yellow skin and a white moustache who wears blue overalls.

It began in 1999 as a series of three-minute shorts and later ran for a season of full-length episodes spanning 21 minutes each. It chronicles the small-scale adventures and discoveries of a three-year-old puppet girl named Mona in her grandmother Nana Bea's backyard. The title is a contraction of the phrase \"Nana Land,\" referring to the setting.\n\nHopley and Shannon, who continued to work with Nickelodeon afterwards on their creation ''[[Mr. Meaty]]'', produced the series through their puppetry troupe [[The Grogs]] in association with [[Jack Lenz|Lenz Entertainment]]. The show uses a blend of hand puppetry and the manipulation of cardboard cutouts, particularly in the opening theme. While the shorts do not follow a structure, the half-hour episodes follow a loose format that includes at least one song and reading an original story to the viewers.\n\nThe show received three nominations at the 2004 [[Gemini Awards]] and was fairly well-received by Canadian and U.S. press, with some critics calling attention to the show's surreal presentation and genuine approach to its concept. It was short-lived, as Nickelodeon did not pick up a second season. In 2004, select episodes were released across several [[DVD]]s in the United States. In 2015, the series [[viral phenomenon|went viral]] with a resurgence in popularity on websites such as [[Tumblr]] and [[YouTube]] for its bizarre nature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Tanya|title=Teens On Tumblr Are Obsessed With This Fucked Up Canadian Kids Show|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tanyachen/nanalan-why|website=Buzzfeed|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bobkin|first1=Matt|title=Canadian kids\u2019 show Nanalan\u2019 goes viral, validates weirdness of Canadian millennials|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/television/canadian-kids-show-nanalan-goes-viral-validates-weirdness-of-canadian-millennials|website=National Post|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show focuses on Mona, a three-year-old girl with a big imagination and a tendency to repeat short words or phrases while also pronouncing them incorrectly. Each episode begins with Mona's mother dropping her daughter off at Nana's house and ends with her picking Mona up. Mona, Nana, and Nana's pet dog Russell spend the day exploring, learning, and visiting Nana's next-door neighbour Mr. Wooka.\n\n==Characters==\n*Mona ([[Jamie Shannon]]) is the main character. She is a humanoid three-year-old with green skin, a spherical head, wide bean-shaped eyes, and lime green hair tied into pigtails. In the original shorts, she cannot speak in full sentences and can only say a few words. She tends to mispronounce everything she says; for example, she says ''pea pod'' as \"peepo\" and ''mushroom'' as \"shoosh.\"\n*Nana ([[The Grogs|Jason Hopley]]) is Mona's grandmother, whom she stays with every weekday while her mother goes to work. She resembles a carrot, with bright orange skin and a very tall forehead. She wears a gaudy multicolored dress, big circular glasses, and a white wig. In the original shorts, her hair was dark red-orange.\n*Russell ([[Ali Eisner]]) is Nana's pet [[Jack Russell Terrier]] dog who accompanies Mona when she visits. He does not talk and only barks or sniffs to communicate. Mona cannot pronounce his name correctly and always calls him \"Russer.\"\n*Mr. Wooka ([[Todd Doldersum]]) is Nana's next-door neighbor who is a main character in the full-length episodes. He is an elderly man with yellow skin and a white moustache who wears blue overalls. Whenever Mona visits his yard, he puts on his own puppet shows to entertain her.\n*Mrs. Bea (Marty Stelnick) is Mona's mother and Nana's daughter. She has a similar appearance to Mona but is taller and has brown hair in a bowl cut. She is a parent who works during the day and leaves Mona in Nana's care most of the time.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was filmed in a building \"reputed to be an old munitions factory\" in the television production district of [[Liberty Village]] in Toronto, Ontario.<ref name=globe>{{cite news|title=Puppeteers pull their own strings|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/puppeteers-pull-their-own-strings/article1125279/|last=Kohler|first=Nicholas|date=January 8, 2004|accessdate=March 13, 2016|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=[[The Woodbridge Company]]}}</ref> The shorts were produced in 1999 and first aired on Nickelodeon's sister channel [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]].
