It was fought off [[Cape Passaro]], in the southern tip of the [[Sicily|island of Sicily]] of which Spain had occupied. Spain and Britain were at peace. but Britain was already committed to supporting the ambitions of the Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in southern Italy.\n\nThe battle was fought without a formal declaration of war but once the Spanish fired on the nearest British ships, this gave Byng his excuse to attack. The British were superior in numbers. The battle was the most significant naval action of the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the British fleet, which captured or burned sixteen Spanish ships of line and frigates and several small vessels. Some of the Spanish ships were taken in the main action and some taken or burnt by their crews, who fled to the coast of Sicily. Both Castaneta and Chacon were captured. As a result of the battle the Spanish army in Sicily were thus isolated and cut off from outside help. Four months later the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] was formally declared.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Felipe V, duque de Anjou.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Philip V of Spain]] around 1720. Oil on canvas by [[Miguel Jacinto Mel\u00e9ndez]] in the [[Prado Museum]].]]\n\nOn 11 April, 1713, after the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] was signed between [[France]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. It marked the end of the [[Spanish Empire]] in Europe, as the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Duchy of Milan]] and [[Sardinia]] were ceded to Austria, the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] to Savoy, [[Gelderland]] to the Kingdom of Prussia, and [[Minorca]] and [[Gibraltar]] to Great Britain. France had succeeded in placing a king of her own royal house on a neighbouring throne, but the ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had been defeated and the European system based on the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] largely directed by Britain was preserved.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=219}}\n[[File:Cardinale Giulio Alberoni.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Giulio Alberoni]]]]\n\nThe British gains at the expense of the French and Spanish allowed it to strengthen her naval power.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=219}} Gibraltar and [[Port Mahon]] in the [[Mediterranean]] and the colonies of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland]] in [[North America]] proved useful to extend and protect British trade.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=220}}{{sfn|Black|1994|p=110}} In comparison, the Spanish navy was old and many of their ships needed refitting.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=110}} Philip ordered more [[shipbuilding]] to commence in the American and Spanish shipyards.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=110-111}} The major political figure [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Giulio Alberoni]], who had come from the [[Duchy of Parma]] proceeded to reorganise the royal administration.{{sfn|Paoletti|2008|p=49}} Alberoni had promised Philip to put Spain in a strong position to recover Sicily and Naples if there were five years of peace. Alberoni was even willing to help Philip V to overthrow the Regent of France, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philip of Orleans]], and alienate that country in order to grant trade benefits to Britain with the aim of isolating Austria.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=234}}\n\nThe British monarch [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who was also [[Elector of Hanover]], felt threatened by Alberoni who thought he would undermine the power of Emperor Charles VI. Alberoni on hearing this withdrew all claims. This, together with Philip's claims over the French throne, turned Great Britain and France against Spain.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=234}} Both countries, jointly with the United Provinces, had formed the so-called [[Triple Alliance (1717)|Triple Alliance]] a year before to maintain the balance of power in the continent.{{sfn|Sheehan|1996|p=110}} Meanwhile, both Austria and Spain were at loggerheads over Sicily. The British statesmen preferred the island to be ceded to their former ally rather than Spain. France, under the weakness of Philip of Orleans agreed, and it was proposed to modify the Treaty of Utrecht and force [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II of Savoy]] to exchange Sicily for Sardinia. The detention of the Spanish [[Grand Inquisitor]] Jos\u00e9 Molin\u00e9s at [[Milan]] however by orders of the Emperor gave Spain a pretext to initiate military hostilities in Italy.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=235}}\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 22 July 1717, a large Spanish fleet set sail from Barcelona{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=135}} with an army led by the Flemish nobleman Lieutenant General [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Bette, Marquis of Lede]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=138}} This force then captured the island of Sardinia. At the same time negotiations had ensued between Austria, Spain, and France in order to avoid a war.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=235}} The British and French envoys at the same time offered Philip V the Duchies of Parma and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and also to renounce Charles VI's claim to the Spanish throne, if Philip abandoned Sicily and accepted Sardinia. In view of Alberoni's negatives, even Gibraltar was offered. The Cardinal was strengthening Spain's position in Europe by forming an alliance with [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]], with the aim of restoring the [[House of Stuart]] to the British throne.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=236}}\n\n===Byng sent to the Mediterranean===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9Pati\u00f1oMuseoNaval.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Portrait of Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o by [[Jean Ranc]] commander of the Spanish expedition]]\n\nIn the early months of 1718 a large number of Royal Naval vessels began to be commissioned and refitted; this alarmed the Spanish ambassador, the Marquis of Monteleon.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=144}} Admiral George Byng, a man of long experience, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean on 24 March. He was, upon his arrival there to inform the King of Spain, the [[Viceroy of Naples]] (at that time [[Count Wirich Philipp von Daun]]) and the [[List of Governors of the Duchy of Milan|Governor of Milan]] (the Prince Maximilian Karl of L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Wertheim), that he had been sent to settle the differences between Spain and Austria.\n\nByng set sail from [[Spithead]] on 15 June with a fleet of twenty ships of line, two fireships, two bomb vessels, a store ship, a hospital ship and two tenders.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=31}} On 30 June he arrived at C\u00e1diz and sent a letter to the British ambassador at Madrid, [[William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington|William Stanhope]], informing Philip V of the presence of the British fleet.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=148}} Alberoni wrote Byng that if he attacked the Spanish fleet he should prepare for a humiliating defeat. Stanhope replied that Britain was acting only as a mediator. Nine days later, Alberoni wrote to Stanhope that Byng would execute his sovereign's orders.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=31}}{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=149}}\n[[File:George Byng (1663-1733), 1st Viscount Torrington.jpg|thumb|200px|Admiral Sir [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|George Byng]]. Oil on canvas by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]]]]\n\nByng resumed his voyage and by 8 July the British fleet was rejoined off [[Cape Spartel]] by the two ships with news of the Spanish fleets departure from Barcelona on 18 June.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=32}} Byng was joined by Vice-admiral [[Charles Cornwall]] with a small division of two ships from Gibraltar, [[HMS Argyll (1722)|HMS ''Argyll'']] and [[HMS Charles Galley (1676)|HMS ''Charles Galley'']]. On 23 July Byng anchored off [[Mah\u00f3n|Port-Mahon]] and while reinforcing the garrison there was told that the Spanish fleet had been seen on 30 June off Naples. Two days later, the British fleet set sail, arriving at the [[Bay of Naples]] on 1 August.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=32}}\n\n===Spanish invasion of Sicily===\nOn 18 June a Spanish expedition sailed from Barcelona consisting of twelve ships of line, seventeen frigates, seven galleys, two fireships, and two bomb vessels, plus 276 transports and 123 [[tartane]]s commanded by Admiral [[Antonio de Gazta\u00f1eta]] and the General Quartermaster of the Spanish navy, [[Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o|Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o Rosales]]. This fleet carried aboard 36,000 infantrymen and 8,000 horse, along with artillery, supplies, and ammunition again under the command of Marquis of Lede.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=140}} their objective was the island of Sicily.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=141}} On 30 June, having embarked reinforcements at the Bay of Cagliari between 25 and 27 June, the Spanish fleet came in sight of the city of [[Palermo]]. The Austrian force, surprised by Spanish numbers, evacuated Palermo.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=141}} A month later, most of the island had fallen to the Spaniards with little or nor resistance, with the exception of [[Messina]] and a few coastal fortresses.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=32}}\n\nAs Victor Amadeus II of Savoy had agreed to surrender Sicily to the Emperor, the Austrian Viceroy of Naples, Wirich Philipp von Daun, asked Byng to transport 2,000 German infantry under General Wetzel to the citadel of Messina.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=152}} Byng agreed and sailed from Naples on 6 August, while the Spanish fleet was anchored off Paradiso.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=144}}\n\nByng also proposed a [[ceasefire|\"cessation of arms\"]] in Sicily for two months, but Lede declined. With this offer rejected, Byng was left with no choice but to help the Imperialists and Savoyards resist Spanish attack. The British fleet arrived at Messina but were discovered by a Spanish [[felucca]] on 8 August, heading to the point of the Faro.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|pp=154-56}} The Marquis of Mari warned Gazta\u00f1eta and Pati\u00f1o of the inferiority of the Spanish fleet, and the [[Irish people|Irish-born]] Squadron Chief George Cammock, a former officer in the British Royal Navy, proposed that the fleet anchor in the Paradiso roadstead where it could be assisted with [[shore batteries]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=144}} This defensive position would, according to Cammock, favour the Spanish ships, as the strong currents of the Faro would throw Byng over them, thus avoiding a feared long-range cannonade. Gazta\u00f1eta and Pati\u00f1o, however, were confident of the peaceful intentions of Byng due to Alberoni's letters, and they decided to sail to Malta to join forces with Baltasar de Guevara.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=145}}\n[[File:Admiral Byng's Fleet at Naples.jpg|thumb|center|720px|View of the [[Bay of Naples]] with Admiral Byng's Fleet at Anchor, 1 August 1718.

No defensive disposition was taken by Gazta\u00f1eta, except to leave behind two [[frigate]]s to follow the British fleet in distance.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=148}} As Byng stood in off Faro Point, both ships were detected. At the same time, a felucca from the [[Calabria]]n coast informed the British admiral that the Spanish fleet had been seen from the hills laying in. Byng dispatched German troops they were carrying to [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] under escort of two of his ships while he headed to Faro point and sent scouts ahead. At noon they discovered the Spanish fleet, drawn into a [[line of battle]]: 27 ships of the line and frigates, two fireships, four bomb-vessels, seven galleys, and several storeships.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=155}} Byng followed them during the rest of the day. A Spanish account of the battle said that, on the morning of 10 August, the Spanish ships saluted the British ones as they approached, not showing, therefore, any sign of belligerence. The night passed with fair weather; small winds and sometimes calm.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=156}} The following morning the Spanish fleet was dispersed, with ships divided into three large groups separated from each other. Gazta\u00f1eta tried then to form a line of battle by towing his ships of the line with the galleys, but had no time.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=149}}\n\nThe Marquis of Mari, who commanded the Spanish rear, had under his command various warships: the ship of line ''El Real'', the frigates ''San Isidro'', ''Tigre'', ''\u00c1guila de Nantes'', two bomb-vessels, a fireship, and some storeships, besides the galley squadron. Mari had lagged behind and was near the shore off [[Avola]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=149}} The British vessels were close to them, and Byng dispatched Captain [[George Walton (Royal Navy officer)|George Walton]] of {{HMS|Canterbury|1693|6}} with five more vessels to chase them. [[HMS Bonaventure (1650)|HMS ''Argyll'']] fired two shots near De Mari's ''El Real'', while ''Canterbury'' fired three more. Then, Mari's ship returned fire and the battle ensued with British at an advantage.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=156}} The Marquis, having his ship badly mauled by the British gunfire, resolved to drive his squadron ashore, and later set fire to the ships to avoid capture. His own ship sustained fifty casualties, killed and wounded, and had her [[rigging]] severely damaged. She was ran aground and her crew escaped inland, but the ship was refloated by her British captors. Two of the Spanish frigates were completely burned; their crews also escaped. ''Sorpresa'', under Captain Miguel de Sada, was the only ship which offered battle, but were forced to surrender, having sustained heavy damage and casualties. The other Spanish vessels [[Striking the colors|struck their colours]] after a brief engagement, following which the British took possession of them.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=149}}\n\n===Attack on the Spanish centre===\n[[File:Cape Passaro 1718.jpg|thumb|The Spanish flagship ''San Felipe'' flanked on either side by British ships, probably ''Superbe'' and ''Kent'' - painting by [[Isaac Sailmaker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0350&picture=1#content |title=The Battle of Cape Passaro, 11 August 1718|publisher=National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Antonio Gazta\u00f1eta.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Antonio de Gazta\u00f1eta]]\n\nWith the Spanish rear now severed from the main fleet, Byng committed most of his vessels in pursuing Gazta\u00f1eta's squadron, which continued its way towards Cape Passaro. The Spanish admiral had with him six ships of the line and four frigates, but had not succeeded in forming a line of battle. [[HMS Oxford (1674)|HMS ''Oxford'']] and [[HMS Grafton (1709)|HMS ''Grafton'']] were the first two British ships of the line to engage Gazta\u00f1eta's centre. At 10 AM, as they approached, the disorganised Spanish vessels opened fire. The two British ships returned fired, having been ordered by Byng not to fire until the Spaniards repeated their firing.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=157}} ''Oxford'' fell upon the 64-gun ''Santa Rosa'' and took her after a murderous cannonade, supported by other British ships in the distance. The 60-gun ''San Carlos'' struck her colours to Captain Thomas Matthews' [[HMS Kent (1679)|HMS ''Kent'']], having made little resistance. Captain [[Nicholas Haddock]]'s ''Grafton'', meanwhile, confronted ''Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias'' (formerly [[HMS Cumberland (1695)|HMS ''Cumberland'']]), under Chief of Squadron Fernando Chac\u00f3n, together with HMS ''Breda'' and HMS ''Captain''. ''Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias'' was left almost shattered by ''Grafton'' and had most of her crew killed or injured, including Chac\u00f3n, who was wounded in the face by splinters.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}} The ship surrendered to ''Breda'' and ''Captain'' while ''Grafton'' moved to engage another Spanish ship of sixty guns on his starboard.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=157}}\n\nAt 1 PM, Gazta\u00f1eta's flagship, the 74-gun ''San Felipe'', was attacked by ''Kent'' and soon after by ''Superb'', from which she received two broadsides. A running fight took place for two hours between the Spanish admiral's ship, supported by three others, and Byng's division of seven ships of line and a fireship.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=162}} Gazta\u00f1eta held off his pursuers until ''Kent'', bearing down under his stern, fired a broadside and fell to the leeward while ''Superb'' fell simultaneously on his weather-quarter.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=157}} ''San Felipe'', which could only return fire with her after guns, was left dismasted and had its hull severely mauled, but Gazta\u00f1eta was unwilling to surrender. Byng's [[HMS Barfleur (1697)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] came close to ''San Felipe'', and Byng demanded that Gazta\u00f1eta strike his colours or Byng would dispatch one of his fireships against ''San Felipe''.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=150}} Gazta\u00f1eta refused and responded with a broadside. The British fired back and he received a shot which pierced his left leg and wounded his right heel. ''Volante'', commanded by Captain Antonio Escudero, attempted to relieve ''San Felipe''. staying close to her with the aim to attract some of the British fire upon herself.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}} Pierced by the fire of three British ships, she struck to [[HMS Montague (1654)|HMS ''Montague'']] and [[HMS Rupert (1666)|HMS ''Rupert'']] at nightfall.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=158}} ''San Felipe'', having 200 men out of action, amongst them [[flag captain]] Pedro Dexpois, who had been hit by the shattered bones of a sailor cut in half by a cannonball, also surrendered.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=150}} Of the remaining ships of Gazta\u00f1eta's squadron, ''Juno'' meanwhile had been taken by [[HMS Essex (1679)|HMS ''Essex'']] after a three-hour fight.\n[[File:Sir George Walton.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Portrait of Sir George Walton, by [[Bartholomew Dandridge (artist)|Bartholomew Dandridge]]]]\n\n===Guevara's arrival and retreat===\nIn almost total darkness, Gazta\u00f1eta's ''San Felipe'' struck her colours. Baltasar de Guevara, in ''San Luis'' with another ship of line, came in sight of the Spanish flagship, which had been alerted by the gunfire. Guevara's two ships bore down windward of them and exchanged a broadside with Byng's ''Barfleur''.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=158}} Told that ''San Felipe'' had surrendered, Guevara charged upon the wind and committed himself to collect the few Spanish ships still fighting on. The frigate ''Perla'' under Captain Gabriel Alderete, was relieved and allowed to escape from the three British ships. Together with another frigate, ''San Juan el Chicho'', they left the battle, and headed towards Malta.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}} Byng pursued them for sometime, but given the fading light and low wind, he decided to stay with his fleet.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=158}} George Cammock, convinced of the defeat, set sail to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] island of [[Corfu]] with his flagship ''San Fernando'' and a frigate.\n[[File:The Battle of Cape Passaro, 11 August 1718 RMG PW5730.tiff|thumb|An aerial view of the battle by [[Peter Monamy]]]]\n\nFrancisco Grimau's seven galleys, taking advantage of favourable winds, retired to Palermo. The ships which managed to escape were, besides the galleys, four ships of the line, nine frigates, a bomb galley, and one of Pintado's ships.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=164}} The 64-gun ''Santa Isabel'', under Captain [[Andr\u00e9s Reggio|Andrea Reggio]], was pursued all through the night and surrendered the next morning to Rear Admiral [[George Delaval]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=152}} The British, in contrast, sustained trifling damage with no more than 500 killed or wounded all told. Of Byng's fleet, the ship which suffered the most damage was ''Grafton''; but she had engaged and disabled several Spanish vessels. The necessary repairs of the Royal Navy ships, mostly in the rigging, and those relating to prizes taken, were done over the following days.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=159}} On 18 August Byng received a letter from Captain Walton:\n\n{{quote|Sir, We have taken and destroyed all the Spanish ships and vessels which were upon the coast, the number as per margin.|20|20|Captain [[George Walton (Royal Navy officer)|George Walton]] ''Canterbury'', off Syracuse, August 16, 1718.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=159}}}}\n\n===End of the battle===\nWalton had succeeded in capturing, by his own account, four men-of-war, a bomb vessel and a storeship in addition to burning four other men-of-war.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=160}} Having repaired his damaged ships, Byng entered the port of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], then held by Savoyard troops under the Count of Maffei and blockaded by the Spanish army.{{sfn|Cust|1858|p=158}} From there Byng dispatched five captured Spanish ships of the line and four Spanish frigates to Port-Mahon under a heavy escort. One of his ships, Gatza\u00f1eta's ''San Felipe'', took fire accidentally and blew up with most of his crew; 160 British and 50 Spaniards.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=155}} According to Spanish accounts, shortly after the action, a captain of the British fleet made a complaint to the Marquis of Lede in the name of Byng, stating that the Spaniards had fired first.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=164}} Gazta\u00f1eta and his officers were dispatched to [[Augusta (Italy)|Augusta]] in a felucca, having taken an oath not to take up arms against the Habsburg armies for four months. Of the haul of Spanish prisoners taken \u2013 2,600 who were wounded or sick, were also freed.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=156}} Of the Spanish ships which escaped to Malta, where the Sicilian galleys under the Marquis of Rivaroles were still anchored.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=168}} The Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, the Catalan Ramon Perellos y Roccaful, was a sympathiser of the [[House of Habsburg]] and refused entry to the Spanish.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Charles VI 1716.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], in 1716.

Byng's victory over the Spanish fleet ensured him the Sicilian throne.]]\nHaving achieved his goal of destroying or capturing the bulk of Spanish fleet, Byng, then anchored at Malta. He was resolved to commit all his efforts to lift the Siege of Messina but to his surprise, even though German reinforcements broke through to the citadel, the Marquis d'Andorno surrendered on 29 September. The Marquis of Lede then held all of Sicily except the towns of Syracuse, [[Melazzo]], and [[Trapani]], held by considerable Savoyard garrisons for the following months.{{sfn|Cust|1858|p=158}} Byng detached four of his ships to eliminate Cammock's surviving ships and blockade the Spanish army. In the harbour of Augusta, the British attacked a convoy of small vessels and forced the Spaniards to burn a bomb vessel and a fireship. Off Palermo, HMS ''Grafton'' captured two Genoese vessels which had sailed from [[Porto Longone]] with a corps of [[Swiss mercenaries]], munitions, and gunpowder.

It was fought off [[Cape Passaro]], in the southern tip of the [[Sicily|island of Sicily]] of which Spain had occupied. Spain and Britain were at peace. but Britain was already committed to supporting the ambitions of the Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in southern Italy.\n\nThe battle was fought without a formal declaration of war but once the Spanish fired on the nearest British ships, this gave Byng his excuse to attack. The British were superior in numbers. The battle was the most significant naval action of the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the British fleet, which captured or burned sixteen Spanish ships of line and frigates and several small vessels. Some of the Spanish ships were taken in the main action and some taken or burnt by their crews, who fled to the coast of Sicily. Both Castaneta and Chacon were captured. As a result of the battle the Spanish army in Sicily were thus isolated and cut off from outside help. Four months later the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] was formally declared.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Felipe V, duque de Anjou.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Philip V of Spain]] around 1720. Oil on canvas by [[Miguel Jacinto Mel\u00e9ndez]] in the [[Prado Museum]].]]\n\nOn 11 April, 1713, after the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] was signed between [[France]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. It marked the end of the [[Spanish Empire]] in Europe, as the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Duchy of Milan]] and [[Sardinia]] were ceded to Austria, the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] to Savoy, [[Gelderland]] to the Kingdom of Prussia, and [[Minorca]] and [[Gibraltar]] to Great Britain. France had succeeded in placing a king of her own royal house on a neighbouring throne, but the ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had been defeated and the European system based on the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] largely directed by Britain was preserved.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=219}}\n[[File:Cardinale Giulio Alberoni.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Giulio Alberoni]]]]\n\nThe British gains at the expense of the French and Spanish allowed it to strengthen her naval power.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=219}} Gibraltar and [[Port Mahon]] in the [[Mediterranean]] and the colonies of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland]] in [[North America]] proved useful to extend and protect British trade.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=220}}{{sfn|Black|1994|p=110}} In comparison, the Spanish navy was old and many of their ships needed refitting.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=110}} Philip ordered more [[shipbuilding]] to commence in the American and Spanish shipyards.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=110-111}} The major political figure [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Giulio Alberoni]], who had come from the [[Duchy of Parma]] proceeded to reorganise the royal administration.{{sfn|Paoletti|2008|p=49}} Alberoni had promised Philip to put Spain in a strong position to recover Sicily and Naples if there were five years of peace. Alberoni was even willing to help Philip V to overthrow the Regent of France, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philip of Orleans]], and alienate that country in order to grant trade benefits to Britain with the aim of isolating Austria.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=234}}\n\nThe British monarch [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who was also [[Elector of Hanover]], felt threatened by Alberoni who thought he would undermine the power of Emperor Charles VI. Alberoni on hearing this withdrew all claims. This, together with Philip's claims over the French throne, turned Great Britain and France against Spain.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=234}} Both countries, jointly with the United Provinces, had formed the so-called [[Triple Alliance (1717)|Triple Alliance]] a year before to maintain the balance of power in the continent.{{sfn|Sheehan|1996|p=110}} Meanwhile, both Austria and Spain were at loggerheads over Sicily. The British statesmen preferred the island to be ceded to their former ally rather than Spain. France, under the weakness of Philip of Orleans agreed, and it was proposed to modify the Treaty of Utrecht and force [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II of Savoy]] to exchange Sicily for Sardinia. The detention of the Spanish [[Grand Inquisitor]] Jos\u00e9 Molin\u00e9s at [[Milan]] however by orders of the Emperor gave Spain a pretext to initiate military hostilities in Italy.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=235}}\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 22 July 1717, a large Spanish fleet set sail from Barcelona{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=135}} with an army led by the Flemish nobleman Lieutenant General [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Bette, Marquis of Lede]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=138}} This force then captured the island of Sardinia. At the same time negotiations had ensued between Austria, Spain, and France in order to avoid a war.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=235}} The British and French envoys at the same time offered Philip V the Duchies of Parma and [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and also to renounce Charles VI's claim to the Spanish throne, if Philip abandoned Sicily and accepted Sardinia. In view of Alberoni's negatives, even Gibraltar was offered. The Cardinal was strengthening Spain's position in Europe by forming an alliance with [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]], with the aim of restoring the [[House of Stuart]] to the British throne.{{sfn|Mahan|1895|p=236}}\n\n===Byng sent to the Mediterranean===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9Pati\u00f1oMuseoNaval.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Portrait of Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o by [[Jean Ranc]] commander of the Spanish expedition]]\n\nIn the early months of 1718 a large number of Royal Naval vessels began to be commissioned and refitted; this alarmed the Spanish ambassador, the Marquis of Monteleon.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=144}} Admiral George Byng, a man of long experience, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean on 24 March. He was, upon his arrival there to inform the King of Spain, the [[Viceroy of Naples]] (at that time [[Count Wirich Philipp von Daun]]) and the [[List of Governors of the Duchy of Milan|Governor of Milan]] (the Prince Maximilian Karl of L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Wertheim), that he had been sent to settle the differences between Spain and Austria.\n\nByng set sail from [[Spithead]] on 15 June with a fleet of twenty ships of line, two fireships, two bomb vessels, a store ship, a hospital ship and two tenders.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=31}} On 30 June he arrived at C\u00e1diz and sent a letter to the British ambassador at Madrid, [[William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington|William Stanhope]], informing Philip V of the presence of the British fleet.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=148}} Alberoni wrote Byng that if he attacked the Spanish fleet he should prepare for a humiliating defeat. Stanhope replied that Britain was acting only as a mediator. Nine days later, Alberoni wrote to Stanhope that Byng would execute his sovereign's orders.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=31}}{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=149}}\n[[File:George Byng (1663-1733), 1st Viscount Torrington.jpg|thumb|200px|Admiral Sir [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|George Byng]]. Oil on canvas by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]]]]\n\nByng resumed his voyage and by 8 July the British fleet was rejoined off [[Cape Spartel]] by the two ships with news of the Spanish fleets departure from Barcelona on 18 June.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=32}} Byng was joined by Vice-admiral [[Charles Cornwall]] with a small division of two ships from Gibraltar, [[HMS Argyll (1722)|HMS ''Argyll'']] and [[HMS Charles Galley (1676)|HMS ''Charles Galley'']]. On 23 July Byng anchored off [[Mah\u00f3n|Port-Mahon]] and while reinforcing the garrison there was told that the Spanish fleet had been seen on 30 June off Naples. Two days later, the British fleet set sail, arriving at the [[Bay of Naples]] on 1 August.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=32}}\n\n===Spanish invasion of Sicily===\nOn 18 June a Spanish expedition sailed from Barcelona consisting of twelve ships of line, seventeen frigates, seven galleys, two fireships, and two bomb vessels, plus 276 transports and 123 [[tartane]]s commanded by Admiral [[Antonio de Gazta\u00f1eta]] and the General Quartermaster of the Spanish navy, [[Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o|Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o Rosales]]. This fleet carried aboard 36,000 infantrymen and 8,000 horse, along with artillery, supplies, and ammunition again under the command of Marquis of Lede.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=140}} their objective was the island of Sicily.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=141}} On 30 June, having embarked reinforcements at the Bay of Cagliari between 25 and 27 June, the Spanish fleet came in sight of the city of [[Palermo]]. The Austrian force, surprised by Spanish numbers, evacuated Palermo.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=141}} A month later, most of the island had fallen to the Spaniards with little or nor resistance, with the exception of [[Messina]] and a few coastal fortresses.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=32}}\n\nAs Victor Amadeus II of Savoy had agreed to surrender Sicily to the Emperor, the Austrian Viceroy of Naples, Wirich Philipp von Daun, asked Byng to transport 2,000 German infantry under General Wetzel to the citadel of Messina.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=152}} Byng agreed and sailed from Naples on 6 August, while the Spanish fleet was anchored off Paradiso.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=144}}\n\nByng also proposed a [[ceasefire|\"cessation of arms\"]] in Sicily for two months, but Lede declined. With this offer rejected, Byng was left with no choice but to help the Imperialists and Savoyards resist Spanish attack. The British fleet arrived at Messina but were discovered by a Spanish [[felucca]] on 8 August, heading to the point of the Faro.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|pp=154-56}} The Marquis of Mari warned Gazta\u00f1eta and Pati\u00f1o of the inferiority of the Spanish fleet, and the [[Irish people|Irish-born]] Squadron Chief George Cammock, a former officer in the British Royal Navy, proposed that the fleet anchor in the Paradiso roadstead where it could be assisted with [[shore batteries]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=144}} This defensive position would, according to Cammock, favour the Spanish ships, as the strong currents of the Faro would throw Byng over them, thus avoiding a feared long-range cannonade. Gazta\u00f1eta and Pati\u00f1o, however, were confident of the peaceful intentions of Byng due to Alberoni's letters, and they decided to sail to Malta to join forces with Baltasar de Guevara.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=145}}\n[[File:Admiral Byng's Fleet at Naples.jpg|thumb|center|720px|View of the [[Bay of Naples]] with Admiral Byng's Fleet at Anchor, 1 August 1718.

No defensive disposition was taken by Gazta\u00f1eta, except to leave behind two [[frigate]]s to follow the British fleet in distance.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=148}} As Byng stood in off Faro Point, both ships were detected. At the same time, a felucca from the [[Calabria]]n coast informed the British admiral that the Spanish fleet had been seen from the hills laying in. Byng dispatched German troops they were carrying to [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] under escort of two of his ships while he headed to Faro point and sent scouts ahead. At noon they discovered the Spanish fleet, drawn into a [[line of battle]]: 27 ships of the line and frigates, two fireships, four bomb-vessels, seven galleys, and several storeships.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=155}} Byng followed them during the rest of the day. A Spanish account of the battle said that, on the morning of 10 August, the Spanish ships saluted the British ones as they approached, not showing, therefore, any sign of belligerence. The night passed with fair weather; small winds and sometimes calm.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=156}} The following morning the Spanish fleet was dispersed, with ships divided into three large groups separated from each other. Gazta\u00f1eta tried then to form a line of battle by towing his ships of the line with the galleys, but had no time.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=149}}\n\nThe Marquis of Mari, who commanded the Spanish rear, had under his command various warships: the ship of line ''El Real'', the frigates ''San Isidro'', ''Tigre'', ''\u00c1guila de Nantes'', two bomb-vessels, a fireship, and some storeships, besides the galley squadron. Mari had lagged behind and was near the shore off [[Avola]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=149}} The British vessels were close to them, and Byng dispatched Captain [[George Walton (Royal Navy officer)|George Walton]] of {{HMS|Canterbury|1693|6}} with five more vessels to chase them. [[HMS Bonaventure (1650)|HMS ''Argyll'']] fired two shots near De Mari's ''El Real'', while ''Canterbury'' fired three more. Then, Mari's ship returned fire and the battle ensued with British at an advantage.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=156}} The Marquis, having his ship badly mauled by the British gunfire, resolved to drive his squadron ashore, and later set fire to the ships to avoid capture. His own ship sustained fifty casualties, killed and wounded, and had her [[rigging]] severely damaged. She was ran aground and her crew escaped inland, but the ship was refloated by her British captors. Two of the Spanish frigates were completely burned; their crews also escaped. ''Sorpresa'', under Captain Miguel de Sada, was the only ship which offered battle, but were forced to surrender, having sustained heavy damage and casualties. The other Spanish vessels [[Striking the colors|struck their colours]] after a brief engagement, following which the British took possession of them.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=149}}\n\n===Attack on the Spanish centre===\n[[File:Cape Passaro 1718.jpg|thumb|The Spanish flagship ''San Felipe'' flanked on either side by British ships, probably ''Superbe'' and ''Kent'' - painting by [[Isaac Sailmaker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0350&picture=1#content |title=The Battle of Cape Passaro, 11 August 1718|publisher=National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Antonio Gazta\u00f1eta.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Antonio de Gazta\u00f1eta]]\n\nWith the Spanish rear now severed from the main fleet, Byng committed most of his vessels in pursuing Gazta\u00f1eta's squadron, which continued its way towards Cape Passaro. The Spanish admiral had with him six ships of the line and four frigates, but had not succeeded in forming a line of battle. [[HMS Oxford (1674)|HMS ''Oxford'']] and [[HMS Grafton (1709)|HMS ''Grafton'']] were the first two British ships of the line to engage Gazta\u00f1eta's centre. At 10 AM, as they approached, the disorganised Spanish vessels opened fire. The two British ships returned fired, having been ordered by Byng not to fire until the Spaniards repeated their firing.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=157}} ''Oxford'' fell upon the 64-gun ''Santa Rosa'' and took her after a murderous cannonade, supported by other British ships in the distance. The 60-gun ''San Carlos'' struck her colours to Captain Thomas Matthews' [[HMS Kent (1679)|HMS ''Kent'']], having made little resistance. Captain [[Nicholas Haddock]]'s ''Grafton'', meanwhile, confronted ''Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias'' (formerly [[HMS Cumberland (1695)|HMS ''Cumberland'']]), under Chief of Squadron Fernando Chac\u00f3n, together with HMS ''Breda'' and HMS ''Captain''. ''Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias'' was left almost shattered by ''Grafton'' and had most of her crew killed or injured, including Chac\u00f3n, who was wounded in the face by splinters.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}} The ship surrendered to ''Breda'' and ''Captain'' while ''Grafton'' moved to engage another Spanish ship of sixty guns on his starboard.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=157}}\n\nAt 1 PM, Gazta\u00f1eta's flagship, the 74-gun ''San Felipe'', was attacked by ''Kent'' and soon after by ''Superb'', from which she received two broadsides. A running fight took place for two hours between the Spanish admiral's ship, supported by three others, and Byng's division of seven ships of line and a fireship.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=162}} Gazta\u00f1eta held off his pursuers until ''Kent'', bearing down under his stern, fired a broadside and fell to the leeward while ''Superb'' fell simultaneously on his weather-quarter.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=157}} ''San Felipe'', which could only return fire with her after guns, was left dismasted and had its hull severely mauled, but Gazta\u00f1eta was unwilling to surrender. Byng's [[HMS Barfleur (1697)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] came close to ''San Felipe'', and Byng demanded that Gazta\u00f1eta strike his colours or Byng would dispatch one of his fireships against ''San Felipe''.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=150}} Gazta\u00f1eta refused and responded with a broadside. The British fired back and he received a shot which pierced his left leg and wounded his right heel. ''Volante'', commanded by Captain Antonio Escudero, attempted to relieve ''San Felipe''. staying close to her with the aim to attract some of the British fire upon herself.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}} Pierced by the fire of three British ships, she struck to [[HMS Montague (1654)|HMS ''Montague'']] and [[HMS Rupert (1666)|HMS ''Rupert'']] at nightfall.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=158}} ''San Felipe'', having 200 men out of action, amongst them [[flag captain]] Pedro Dexpois, who had been hit by the shattered bones of a sailor cut in half by a cannonball, also surrendered.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=150}} Of the remaining ships of Gazta\u00f1eta's squadron, ''Juno'' meanwhile had been taken by [[HMS Essex (1679)|HMS ''Essex'']] after a three-hour fight.\n[[File:Sir George Walton.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Portrait of Sir George Walton, by [[Bartholomew Dandridge (artist)|Bartholomew Dandridge]]]]\n\n===Guevara's arrival and retreat===\nIn almost total darkness, Gazta\u00f1eta's ''San Felipe'' struck her colours. Baltasar de Guevara, in ''San Luis'' with another ship of line, came in sight of the Spanish flagship, which had been alerted by the gunfire. Guevara's two ships bore down windward of them and exchanged a broadside with Byng's ''Barfleur''.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=158}} Told that ''San Felipe'' had surrendered, Guevara charged upon the wind and committed himself to collect the few Spanish ships still fighting on. The frigate ''Perla'' under Captain Gabriel Alderete, was relieved and allowed to escape from the three British ships. Together with another frigate, ''San Juan el Chicho'', they left the battle, and headed towards Malta.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}} Byng pursued them for sometime, but given the fading light and low wind, he decided to stay with his fleet.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=158}} George Cammock, convinced of the defeat, set sail to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] island of [[Corfu]] with his flagship ''San Fernando'' and a frigate.\n[[File:The Battle of Cape Passaro, 11 August 1718 RMG PW5730.tiff|thumb|An aerial view of the battle by [[Peter Monamy]]]]\n\nFrancisco Grimau's seven galleys, taking advantage of favourable winds, retired to Palermo. The ships which managed to escape were, besides the galleys, four ships of the line, nine frigates, a bomb galley, and one of Pintado's ships.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=164}} The 64-gun ''Santa Isabel'', under Captain [[Andr\u00e9s Reggio|Andrea Reggio]], was pursued all through the night and surrendered the next morning to Rear Admiral [[George Delaval]].{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=152}} The British, in contrast, sustained trifling damage with no more than 500 killed or wounded all told. Of Byng's fleet, the ship which suffered the most damage was ''Grafton''; but she had engaged and disabled several Spanish vessels. The necessary repairs of the Royal Navy ships, mostly in the rigging, and those relating to prizes taken, were done over the following days.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=159}} On 18 August Byng received a letter from Captain Walton:\n\n{{quote|Sir, We have taken and destroyed all the Spanish ships and vessels which were upon the coast, the number as per margin.|20|20|Captain [[George Walton (Royal Navy officer)|George Walton]] ''Canterbury'', off Syracuse, August 16, 1718.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=159}}}}\n\n===End of the battle===\nWalton had succeeded in capturing, by his own account, four men-of-war, a bomb vessel and a storeship in addition to burning four other men-of-war.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=160}} Having repaired his damaged ships, Byng entered the port of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], then held by Savoyard troops under the Count of Maffei and blockaded by the Spanish army.{{sfn|Cust|1858|p=158}} From there Byng dispatched five captured Spanish ships of the line and four Spanish frigates to Port-Mahon under a heavy escort. One of his ships, Gatza\u00f1eta's ''San Felipe'', took fire accidentally and blew up with most of his crew; 160 British and 50 Spaniards.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=155}} According to Spanish accounts, shortly after the action, a captain of the British fleet made a complaint to the Marquis of Lede in the name of Byng, stating that the Spaniards had fired first.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=164}} Gazta\u00f1eta and his officers were dispatched to [[Augusta (Italy)|Augusta]] in a felucca, having taken an oath not to take up arms against the Habsburg armies for four months. Of the haul of Spanish prisoners taken \u2013 2,600 who were wounded or sick, were also freed.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=156}} Of the Spanish ships which escaped to Malta, where the Sicilian galleys under the Marquis of Rivaroles were still anchored.{{sfn|Campbell|1818|p=168}} The Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, the Catalan Ramon Perellos y Roccaful, was a sympathiser of the [[House of Habsburg]] and refused entry to the Spanish.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=151}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Charles VI 1716.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], in 1716.

Byng's victory over the Spanish fleet ensured him the Sicilian throne.]]\nHaving achieved his goal of destroying or capturing the bulk of Spanish fleet, Byng, then anchored at Malta. He was resolved to commit all his efforts to lift the Siege of Messina but to his surprise, even though German reinforcements broke through to the citadel, the Marquis d'Andorno surrendered on 29 September. The Marquis of Lede then held all of Sicily except the towns of Syracuse, [[Melazzo]], and [[Trapani]], held by considerable Savoyard garrisons for the following months.{{sfn|Cust|1858|p=158}} Byng detached four of his ships to eliminate Cammock's surviving ships and blockade the Spanish army. In the harbour of Augusta, the British attacked a convoy of small vessels and forced the Spaniards to burn a bomb vessel and a fireship. Off Palermo, HMS ''Grafton'' captured two Genoese vessels which had sailed from [[Porto Longone]] with a corps of [[Swiss mercenaries]], munitions, and gunpowder. A third vessel ran aground when approached by HMS ''Lennox'' near [[Castellammare del Golfo]] and was set on fire, though its crew managed to land 240 men, 700 flintlocks and some gunpowder.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=156}}\n\nAs Byng's attack had virtually destroyed the Spanish fleet at Cape Passaro, the Spanish situation at Sicily considerably worsened over the months following the battle.{{sfn|Cust|1858|p=158}} Their army was isolated on the island, so the War Ministry informed Lede that they couldn't send troops or supplies.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez Duro|1972|p=156}} The blow was felt so severe by Alberoni that he banned the circulation of any information on the expedition and took measures against Great Britain, although he did not immediately declare war. He requested that ambassador Monteleone was to leave London and gave orders to issue [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] to [[privateer]]s and to seize all British vessels and goods in the ports of Spain.{{sfn|Cust|1858|p=159}} This was a task in which Baltasar de Guevera played a major role when he entered the port of [[C\u00e1diz]] with his few surviving ships.{{sfn|Clowes|1897|p=38}} In the meantime, Byng sent his eldest son to England with a full account of the battle. When he was at Naples in November, he received a letter written personally by Emperor Charles VI:\n[[File:Cape Passaro medal1718.jpg|thumb|180px|Medal commemorating the Battle made in 1718 - ''The Spanish fleet destroyed by Jupiter and Neptune'' The gods are symbolic of the Emperor (Charles VI) and the King ([[George I of Great Britain|George I]])]]\n\n{{quote|Admiral Sir George Byng,<br />I have received with a great deal of joy and satisfaction, by the bearer of this, yours of the 18th of August.

Since version 2 it has been sold as [[freemium]] and supports extensibility with [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and [[skin (computing)|skins]], and features [[music visualization]], [[playlist]] and a media library, supported by a large [[online community]].\n\nVersion 1 of Winamp was released in 1997, and grew quickly popular with over 3 million downloads,<ref name=Wired98/> paralleling the developing trend of MP3 (music) [[file sharing]]. Winamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998.

Winamp was one of the first widely used music players on Windows to support playback of [[Ogg Vorbis]] by default.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-1\"/> It supports [[gapless playback]] for MP3 and AAC and [[ReplayGain]] for volume leveling across tracks. CD support includes playing and [[ripping|importing]] music from [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CDs]], optionally with [[CD-Text]], and [[Optical disc authoring|burning]] music to CDs. The standard version limits maximum burn speed and datarate; the \"Pro\" version removes these limitations.<ref name=\"waFeat\"/> <!-- reference for the whole paragraph --> Winamp supports playback of Windows Media Video and [[Nullsoft Streaming Video]]. For MPEG Video, AVI, and other unsupported video types, Winamp uses Microsoft's [[DirectShow]] API for playback, allowing playback of most of the video formats supported by [[Windows Media Player]]. 5.1 [[Surround sound]] is supported where formats and decoders allow.<ref name=\"cnetdixon\"/>\n; Media Library: At installation, Winamp scans the user's system for media files to add to the ''Media Library'' database.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/> It supports full [[Unicode]] filenames and Unicode [[metadata]] for media files.<ref name=\"PCWelt\"/> In the ''Media Library'' user interface pane, under ''Local Media'', several selectors (''Audio'', ''Video'', date, and frequency) permit display of subsets of media files with greater detail.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Adding album art and track tags: ''Get Album Art'' permits retrieval of cover art, and confirmation before adding the image to the database. ''Autotagging'' analyzes a track's audio using the [[Gracenote]] service and retrieves the song's ID2 and ID3 metadata.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Podcatcher: Winamp can also be used as an [[RSS]] media feeds [[feed aggregator|aggregator]] capable of displaying articles, downloading, or playing such content as [[streaming media]]. [[SHOUTcast Wire]] provides a directory and RSS subscription system for [[podcast]]s.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/><ref name=\"Graffeo\"/>\n; Media player device support: Winamp has extendable support for [[portable media player]]s and [[USB mass storage device class|Mass Storage Compliant]] devices, [[Microsoft PlaysForSure]], and [[ActiveSync]], and syncs unprotected music to the [[iPod]].<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/><ref name=\"Hart-Davis\"/>\n; Media Monitor: Winamp ''Media Monitor'' allows web-based browsing and bookmarking music blog websites and automatically offering for streaming or downloading all MP3 files there.  The ''Media Monitor'' is preloaded with music blog URLs.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Winamp Remote: ''Winamp Remote'' allows remote playback (streaming) of unprotected media files on the user's PC via the Internet. ''Remote'' adjusts bitrate based on available bandwidth, and can be controlled by web interface, [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and mobile phones.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Plug-ins: In February 1998, Winamp was rewritten as a \"general-purpose audio player\"<ref name=\"WAv1.90\"/> with a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] architecture.  This feature was received well by reviewers.<ref name=\"Gibbs\"/><ref name=\"MaxPC\"/> Development was early, diverse, and rapid: 66 plugins were published by November 1998.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-2\"/> The ''Winamp [[software development kit]] (SDK)'' allows software developers to create seven different types of plug-ins.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-3\"/>\n:*''Input'': decodes specific file formats.\n:*''Output'': sends data to specific devices or files.\n:*''[[Music visualization|Visualization]]'': provides sound activated graphics.\n:*''[[audio signal processing|DSP/Effect]]'': manipulates audio for special effects.\n:*''General Purpose'' plug-ins add convenience or UI features (''Media Library'', ''alarm clock'', or ''pause when logged out'').\n:*''Media Library'' plug-ins add functions to the Media Library plug-in.\n:*''Portables'' plug-ins support [[portable media player]]s.<ref name=\"MP3.com\"/><!-- reference for this whole paragraph -->\n[[File:Milkdrop Spikeball.jpg|thumb|[[MilkDrop]], a visualization plug-in in Winamp]]\n:Plug-in development support increased Winamp's flexibility for, for example, a plethora of specialized plug-ins for game [[console emulator|console]] music files such as [[NES Sound Format|NSF]],<ref name=\"AutoMZ-4\"/> [[Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format|USF]], [[Game Boy Sound System|GBS]],<ref name=\"AutoMZ-5\"/> [[GBA Sound Format|GSF]],<ref name=\"AutoMZ-6\"/> [[MOS Technology SID|SID]],<ref name=\"chip\"/> [[VGM (file format)|VGM]],<ref name=\"chip\"/> [[SPC700 sound format|SPC]],<ref name=\"chip\"/> [[PlayStation Sound Format|PSF, and PSF2]].\n; Skins: [[Skin (computing)|Skins]] are bitmap files which alter the aesthetic design of the Winamp [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and can add functionality with scripting.<ref name=\"Tidwell\"/> Winamp published documentation on skin creation<ref name=\"Beggs\"/> in 1998 with the release of Winamp 2<!--cited in History--> and invited Winamp users to publish skins on Winamp.com.

Online communities of skin designers such as 1001Skins.com and Skinz.org have contributed thousands of designs;<ref name=\"Hacker141\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-9\"/> also at GnomeArt.<ref name=\"Team GnomeArt\"/> Designers see skins as an opportunity to be creative:<ref name=\"AutoMZ-10\"/> nontraditional examples have included [[Klingon]], [[iPod]], and [[Etch-a-sketch]] designs.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-11\"/> The Winamp skin format is the most popular, the most commonly adopted by other media player software, and is usable across platforms.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-12\"/> One example is the [[XMMS]] player for [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] systems, which can use unmodified Winamp 2 skin files.<ref name=\"AUUGN\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-13\"/> Winamp 5 supports two types of skins&nbsp;\u2013 \"classic\" skins designed to Winamp 2 specifications (static collections of [[bitmap image]]s), and more flexible, freeform \"modern\" skins per the Winamp3 specification.  Modern skins support true [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] transparency, [[scripting language|scripting]] control, a docked toolbar, and other innovations to the user interface.<ref name=\"WinampFAQ\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Initial releases ===\n[[File:Winamp 0.2a.jpg|thumb|WinAMP 0.2a]]\n[[File:WinAMP 0.92.jpg|thumb|WinAMP 0.92]]\nWinamp was first released in 1997, when Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev,<ref name=\"Saltzman\"/><ref name=\"Millard\"/><ref name=\"Mengyi\"/> formerly students at the [[University of Utah]], integrated their [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] user interface with the Advanced Multimedia Products (\"AMP\") MP3 file playback engine.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-14\"/> The name Winamp (originally spelled WinAMP) was a [[portmanteau]] of \"Windows\" and \"AMP\".<ref name=\"portmanteau\" /> The minimalist WinAMP 0.20a was released as freeware on April 21, 1997.<ref name=\"winamp0.2\"/><ref name=\"Haring\"/>\nIts windowless, menu bar-only interface showed only play (open), stop, pause, and unpause functions. A file specified on the command line or dropped onto its icon would be played. MP3 decoding was performed by the AMP decoding engine developed by Advanced Multimedia Products co-founder [[Tomislav Uzelac]], which was free for non-commercial use.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-15\"/>\n\nWinAMP 0.92 was released as a freeware in May 1997. Within the standard Windows frame and menu bar, it had the beginnings of the \"classic\" Winamp GUI: dark gray rectangle with silver 3D-effect transport buttons, a red/green volume slider, time displayed in a green [[Seven-segment display character representations|LED font]], with track name, MP3 bitrate, and \"mixrate\" in green. There was no position bar, and a blank space where the [[spectrum analyzer]] and [[waveform analyzer]] would later appear. Multiple files on the command line or dropped onto its icon were enqueued in the playlist.\n\n=== Winamp 1 ===\n[[File:Winamp1.006.PNG|thumb|Winamp 1]]\n\nVersion 1.006 was released June 7, 1997,<ref name=\"Wired98\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-16\"/> renamed \"Winamp\", i.e., with \"amp\" now in lowercase. It showed a spectrum analyzer and color-changing volume slider, but no waveform display.  The AMP non-commercial license was included in its [[Online help|help menu]].\n\nAccording to Tomislav Uzelac, Frankel licensed the AMP 0.7 engine June 1, 1997.<ref name=\"play1\"/> Frankel formally founded [[Nullsoft]] Inc. in January 1998 and continued development of Winamp, which changed from freeware to $10 [[shareware]].<ref name=Wired98/> Despite the fact that there would be no extra features by paying $10, Winamp's popularity and warm reception brought Nullsoft $100,000 a month that year from $10 paper checks in the mail from paying users.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\" />\n\nIn March, Brian Litman, managing co-founder with Uzelac of Advanced Multimedia Products, which by then had been merged into PlayMedia Systems, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Nullsoft, claiming unlawful use of AMP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://funkidswonderfulhistory.weebly.com/technology-inventions.html|title=Technology/ Inventions|website=British History for KidsKS2|accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref> Nullsoft responded that they had replaced AMP with Nitrane, Nullsoft's proprietary decoder, but Playmedia disputed this.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Third-party reviews found that Nitrane had bugs that resulted in playing back MP3s incorrectly, and that this resulted in unstable tones being added to the playback, and undoubtedly therefore violated the ISO standard. This also means that Nitrane was unlikely to have been based on the AMP software, and was more likely evidence of a hastily written MP3 decoder that didn't concern itself with standards compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mp3decoders.mp3-tech.org/decoders_winamp2_62.html|title=Winamp v2.62 mp3 decoding quality test results|website=mp3decoders.mp3-tech.org|access-date=September 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110191532/http://mp3decoders.mp3-tech.org/decoders_winamp2_62.html|archive-date=November 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nVersion 1.90, released March 31, 1998, was the first release as a general-purpose audio player, and documented on the Winamp website as supporting plugins, of which it included two input plugins (''MOD'' and ''MP3'') and a visualization plugin.<ref name=\"WAv1.90\"/>\nThe installer for Version 1.91, released 18 days later, included ''wave'', ''cdda'', and ''Windows tray handling'' plugins, as well as the famous [[Wesley Willis]]-inspired DEMO.MP3 file ''\"Winamp, it really whips the llama's ass\"''.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-17\"/><ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\nBy July 1998, Winamp's various versions had been downloaded over three million times.<ref name=Wired98/>\n\n=== Winamp 2 ===\n[[File:Winamp2.PNG|thumb|Winamp 2, shown with default Base Skin]]\n\nWinamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998. The 2.x versions were widely used and made Winamp one of the most [[download]]ed pieces of software for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"AutoMZ-18\"/> The new version improved the usability of the playlist, made the equalizer more accurate, introduced more plug-ins and allowed skins for the playlist and equalizer windows.\n\nPlayMedia filed a federal lawsuit against Nullsoft in March 1999. In May 1999, PlayMedia was granted an [[injunction]] by Federal Judge [[A. Howard Matz]] against distribution of Nitrane by Nullsoft, and the same month the lawsuit was settled out-of-court with licensing and confidentiality agreements.<ref name=Haring/> Soon after, Nullsoft switched to an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] decoder from the [[Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]], the developers of the MP3 format.\n\nWinamp 2.10, released March 24, 1999, included a new version of the \"Llama\" ''demo.mp3'' featuring a musical [[Sting (musical phrase)|sting]] and [[bleating]].\n\nNullsoft was purchased by [[AOL]] in June 1999 for $80&nbsp;million in stock, with Nullsoft becoming a subsidiary.<ref name=\"AOL1\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-19\"/> AOL itself merged with [[Time Warner]] in 2000.\n\nNullsoft relaunched the Winamp-specific winamp.com in December 1999 to provide easier access to skins, plug-ins, streaming audio, song downloads, forums, and developer resources.\n\nAs of June 22, 2000, Winamp surpassed 25 million registrants.<ref name=AOL1/>\n\n=== Winamp3 ===\nThe next major Winamp version, Winamp3 (so spelled to include ''mp3'' in the name and to mark its separation from the Winamp 2 codebase), was released on August 9, 2002. It was a complete rewrite of version 2, newly based on the [[Wasabi (software)|Wasabi]] application framework, which offered additional functionality and flexibility. Winamp3 was developed parallel to Winamp 2, but \"many users found it consumed too many system resources and was unstable (or even lacked some valued functionality, such as the ability to count or find the total duration of [[Song|tracks]] in a [[playlist]])\".<ref name=\"AutoMZ-20\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-21\"/> Winamp3 had no [[backward compatibility]] with Winamp 2 plugins, and the [[SHOUTcast]] sourcing plugin was not supported.  No Winamp3 version of SHOUTcast was ever released.\n\nIn response to users reverting to Winamp 2, Nullsoft continued the development of Winamp 2 to versions 2.9 and 2.91 in 2003,<ref name=\"AutoMZ-22\"/> even alluding to it humorously.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-23\"/> The [[beta version]]s 2.92 and 2.95 were released with the inclusion of some of the functionality of the upcoming Winamp 5. During this period the [[Wasabi (software)|Wasabi]] cross-platform [[Application software|application]] framework and [[Skin (computing)|skinnable]] [[GUI]] toolkit was derived from parts of the Winamp3 source code. For [[Linux]], Nullsoft released an [[alpha version]] of Winamp3 on October 9, 2001, but has not updated it despite continued user interest.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-24\"/>\n\nDuring this time Winamp faced stiff competition from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes]].<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\"/>\n\n=== Winamp 5 ===\n[[File:Winamp5.png|thumb|Winamp 5 featuring Winamp Modern skin]]\n\nWinamp 5 was based on the Winamp 2 codebase, but with Winamp3 features such as modern skins incorporated via a plugin,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=167493#post1261545 |title=\"Why no Winamp2 Download\" (post #4) |last=Richman |first=Eddy \"DJ Egg\"}} (forum post by developer)</ref> thus incorporating the main advantages of both products. Regarding the omission of a version 4, Nullsoft joked that \"nobody wants to see a Winamp 4 skin\" (\"4 skin\" being a pun on [[foreskin]]).<ref name=\"AutoMZ-25\"/> It was also joked that \"Winamp 5 is so good they skipped a number\" and \"Winamp 2+3=5,\".<ref name=\"AutoMZ-26\"/> Winamp 5.0 was released in December 2003.\n\nThe original Nullsoft team quit in 2004. As of version 5.1, Winamp development is credited to Ben Allison (Benski) and Maksim Tyrtyshny.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-30\"/><!-- Primary source, harmless for this purpose. -->\n\nFrom version 5.2 onwards, support for synchronizing with an [[iPod]] is built-in.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-27\"/>\n\n==== Winamp 5.5 ====\nWinamp 5.5: The 10th Anniversary Edition was released on October 10, 2007,<ref name=\"AutoMZ-28\"/> ten years after the first release of Winamp (a [[beta version|preview version]] had been released on September 10, 2007). New features to the player included album art support, improved localization support (with several officially localized Winamp releases, including German, Polish, Russian, and French), and a unified player and media library interface skin.  This version dropped support for [[Windows 9x]].<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-29\"/>\n\n==== Winamp 5.6 ====\n[[File:Winamp 5.621.PNG|thumb|Winamp 5.621, when listening to the [[SHOUTcast]] stream]]\nWinamp 5.6 features Android Wi-Fi support and direct mouse wheel support. Fraunhofer AAC codec with VBR encoding support was implemented. Moreover, the option to write ratings to tags (for MP3, WMA/WMV, [[Ogg]], and [[FLAC]]) was added. Hungarian and Indonesian installer translations and language packs were added.\n\nWith the release of Winamp version 5.66 on November 20, 2013, [[AOL]] announced that Winamp.com would shut down on December 20, 2013, and Winamp would cease to be offered for download after that date.<ref name=ars-shutdown />\n\nFive days later, version 5.666 was released with the \"Pro\" and \"Full\" installers being one and the same, in the process removing OpenCandy, Emusic, AOL Search, and AOL Toolbar from the installation bundle. This was announced to be the last release of Winamp from AOL/Nullsoft.<ref name=\"winamp5666post\" />\n\n==== Winamp 5.7 ====\nThere was a Winamp 5.7 beta program for an invitation-based Winamp Cloud feature, which would let Winamp play a user's entire cloud-stored music library across all supported devices.<ref name=\"winampcloud\" /> This feature would have allowed AOL to provide a music locker service that would essentially compete with other [[Comparison of online music lockers|online music lockers]].

It was then acquired by [[Radionomy]] in 2014. Since version 2 it has been sold as [[freemium]] and supports extensibility with [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and [[skin (computing)|skins]], and features [[music visualization]], [[playlist]] and a media library, supported by a large [[online community]].\n\nVersion 1 of Winamp was released in 1997, and grew quickly popular with over 3 million downloads,<ref name=Wired98/> paralleling the developing trend of MP3 (music) [[file sharing]]. Winamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998. The 2.x versions were widely used and made Winamp one of the most [[download]]ed Windows applications.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-18\"/> By 2000, Winamp had over 25 million registered users<ref name=AOL1/> and by 2001 it had 60&nbsp;million users.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/winamp-how-greatest-mp3-player-undid-itself/|title=Winamp's woes: How the greatest MP3 player undid itself|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA poor reception to the 2002 rewrite, Winamp3, was followed by the release of Winamp 5 in 2003, and a later release of version 5.5 in 2007.\n\n== Features ==\n; Playback formats: Winamp supports music playback using [[.mp3|MP3]], [[MIDI]], [[MOD (file format)|MOD]], [[MPEG-1]] audio layers [[.mp1|1]] and [[.mp2|2]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[MPEG-4 Part 14#.MP4 versus .M4A|M4A]], [[FLAC]], [[WAV]], and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. Winamp was one of the first widely used music players on Windows to support playback of [[Ogg Vorbis]] by default.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-1\"/> It supports [[gapless playback]] for MP3 and AAC and [[ReplayGain]] for volume leveling across tracks. CD support includes playing and [[ripping|importing]] music from [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CDs]], optionally with [[CD-Text]], and [[Optical disc authoring|burning]] music to CDs. The standard version limits maximum burn speed and datarate; the \"Pro\" version removes these limitations.<ref name=\"waFeat\"/> <!-- reference for the whole paragraph --> Winamp supports playback of Windows Media Video and [[Nullsoft Streaming Video]]. For MPEG Video, AVI, and other unsupported video types, Winamp uses Microsoft's [[DirectShow]] API for playback, allowing playback of most of the video formats supported by [[Windows Media Player]]. 5.1 [[Surround sound]] is supported where formats and decoders allow.<ref name=\"cnetdixon\"/>\n; Media Library: At installation, Winamp scans the user's system for media files to add to the ''Media Library'' database.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/> It supports full [[Unicode]] filenames and Unicode [[metadata]] for media files.<ref name=\"PCWelt\"/> In the ''Media Library'' user interface pane, under ''Local Media'', several selectors (''Audio'', ''Video'', date, and frequency) permit display of subsets of media files with greater detail.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Adding album art and track tags: ''Get Album Art'' permits retrieval of cover art, and confirmation before adding the image to the database. ''Autotagging'' analyzes a track's audio using the [[Gracenote]] service and retrieves the song's ID2 and ID3 metadata.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Podcatcher: Winamp can also be used as an [[RSS]] media feeds [[feed aggregator|aggregator]] capable of displaying articles, downloading, or playing such content as [[streaming media]]. [[SHOUTcast Wire]] provides a directory and RSS subscription system for [[podcast]]s.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/><ref name=\"Graffeo\"/>\n; Media player device support: Winamp has extendable support for [[portable media player]]s and [[USB mass storage device class|Mass Storage Compliant]] devices, [[Microsoft PlaysForSure]], and [[ActiveSync]], and syncs unprotected music to the [[iPod]].<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/><ref name=\"Hart-Davis\"/>\n; Media Monitor: Winamp ''Media Monitor'' allows web-based browsing and bookmarking music blog websites and automatically offering for streaming or downloading all MP3 files there.  The ''Media Monitor'' is preloaded with music blog URLs.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Winamp Remote: ''Winamp Remote'' allows remote playback (streaming) of unprotected media files on the user's PC via the Internet. ''Remote'' adjusts bitrate based on available bandwidth, and can be controlled by web interface, [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and mobile phones.<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/>\n; Plug-ins: In February 1998, Winamp was rewritten as a \"general-purpose audio player\"<ref name=\"WAv1.90\"/> with a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] architecture.  This feature was received well by reviewers.<ref name=\"Gibbs\"/><ref name=\"MaxPC\"/> Development was early, diverse, and rapid: 66 plugins were published by November 1998.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-2\"/> The ''Winamp [[software development kit]] (SDK)'' allows software developers to create seven different types of plug-ins.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-3\"/>\n:*''Input'': decodes specific file formats.\n:*''Output'': sends data to specific devices or files.\n:*''[[Music visualization|Visualization]]'': provides sound activated graphics.\n:*''[[audio signal processing|DSP/Effect]]'': manipulates audio for special effects.\n:*''General Purpose'' plug-ins add convenience or UI features (''Media Library'', ''alarm clock'', or ''pause when logged out'').\n:*''Media Library'' plug-ins add functions to the Media Library plug-in.\n:*''Portables'' plug-ins support [[portable media player]]s.<ref name=\"MP3.com\"/><!-- reference for this whole paragraph -->\n[[File:Milkdrop Spikeball.jpg|thumb|[[MilkDrop]], a visualization plug-in in Winamp]]\n:Plug-in development support increased Winamp's flexibility for, for example, a plethora of specialized plug-ins for game [[console emulator|console]] music files such as [[NES Sound Format|NSF]],<ref name=\"AutoMZ-4\"/> [[Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format|USF]], [[Game Boy Sound System|GBS]],<ref name=\"AutoMZ-5\"/> [[GBA Sound Format|GSF]],<ref name=\"AutoMZ-6\"/> [[MOS Technology SID|SID]],<ref name=\"chip\"/> [[VGM (file format)|VGM]],<ref name=\"chip\"/> [[SPC700 sound format|SPC]],<ref name=\"chip\"/> [[PlayStation Sound Format|PSF, and PSF2]].\n; Skins: [[Skin (computing)|Skins]] are bitmap files which alter the aesthetic design of the Winamp [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and can add functionality with scripting.<ref name=\"Tidwell\"/> Winamp published documentation on skin creation<ref name=\"Beggs\"/> in 1998 with the release of Winamp 2<!--cited in History--> and invited Winamp users to publish skins on Winamp.com.  As of 2000 there were nearly 3,000 Winamp skins available.<ref name=\"SHacker\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-7\"/> The ability to use skins contributed to Winamp's popularity early in MP3 development.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-8\"/> With the increasing number of available skins, [[genre]]s or categories of skins developed, such as \"Stereo\", \"Anime\", and \"Ugly\". Online communities of skin designers such as 1001Skins.com and Skinz.org have contributed thousands of designs;<ref name=\"Hacker141\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-9\"/> also at GnomeArt.<ref name=\"Team GnomeArt\"/> Designers see skins as an opportunity to be creative:<ref name=\"AutoMZ-10\"/> nontraditional examples have included [[Klingon]], [[iPod]], and [[Etch-a-sketch]] designs.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-11\"/> The Winamp skin format is the most popular, the most commonly adopted by other media player software, and is usable across platforms.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-12\"/> One example is the [[XMMS]] player for [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] systems, which can use unmodified Winamp 2 skin files.<ref name=\"AUUGN\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-13\"/> Winamp 5 supports two types of skins&nbsp;\u2013 \"classic\" skins designed to Winamp 2 specifications (static collections of [[bitmap image]]s), and more flexible, freeform \"modern\" skins per the Winamp3 specification.  Modern skins support true [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] transparency, [[scripting language|scripting]] control, a docked toolbar, and other innovations to the user interface.<ref name=\"WinampFAQ\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Initial releases ===\n[[File:Winamp 0.2a.jpg|thumb|WinAMP 0.2a]]\n[[File:WinAMP 0.92.jpg|thumb|WinAMP 0.92]]\nWinamp was first released in 1997, when Justin Frankel and Dmitry Boldyrev,<ref name=\"Saltzman\"/><ref name=\"Millard\"/><ref name=\"Mengyi\"/> formerly students at the [[University of Utah]], integrated their [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] user interface with the Advanced Multimedia Products (\"AMP\") MP3 file playback engine.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-14\"/> The name Winamp (originally spelled WinAMP) was a [[portmanteau]] of \"Windows\" and \"AMP\".<ref name=\"portmanteau\" /> The minimalist WinAMP 0.20a was released as freeware on April 21, 1997.<ref name=\"winamp0.2\"/><ref name=\"Haring\"/>\nIts windowless, menu bar-only interface showed only play (open), stop, pause, and unpause functions. A file specified on the command line or dropped onto its icon would be played. MP3 decoding was performed by the AMP decoding engine developed by Advanced Multimedia Products co-founder [[Tomislav Uzelac]], which was free for non-commercial use.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-15\"/>\n\nWinAMP 0.92 was released as a freeware in May 1997. Within the standard Windows frame and menu bar, it had the beginnings of the \"classic\" Winamp GUI: dark gray rectangle with silver 3D-effect transport buttons, a red/green volume slider, time displayed in a green [[Seven-segment display character representations|LED font]], with track name, MP3 bitrate, and \"mixrate\" in green. There was no position bar, and a blank space where the [[spectrum analyzer]] and [[waveform analyzer]] would later appear. Multiple files on the command line or dropped onto its icon were enqueued in the playlist.\n\n=== Winamp 1 ===\n[[File:Winamp1.006.PNG|thumb|Winamp 1]]\n\nVersion 1.006 was released June 7, 1997,<ref name=\"Wired98\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-16\"/> renamed \"Winamp\", i.e., with \"amp\" now in lowercase. It showed a spectrum analyzer and color-changing volume slider, but no waveform display.  The AMP non-commercial license was included in its [[Online help|help menu]].\n\nAccording to Tomislav Uzelac, Frankel licensed the AMP 0.7 engine June 1, 1997.<ref name=\"play1\"/> Frankel formally founded [[Nullsoft]] Inc. in January 1998 and continued development of Winamp, which changed from freeware to $10 [[shareware]].<ref name=Wired98/> Despite the fact that there would be no extra features by paying $10, Winamp's popularity and warm reception brought Nullsoft $100,000 a month that year from $10 paper checks in the mail from paying users.<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\" />\n\nIn March, Brian Litman, managing co-founder with Uzelac of Advanced Multimedia Products, which by then had been merged into PlayMedia Systems, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Nullsoft, claiming unlawful use of AMP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://funkidswonderfulhistory.weebly.com/technology-inventions.html|title=Technology/ Inventions|website=British History for KidsKS2|accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref> Nullsoft responded that they had replaced AMP with Nitrane, Nullsoft's proprietary decoder, but Playmedia disputed this.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Third-party reviews found that Nitrane had bugs that resulted in playing back MP3s incorrectly, and that this resulted in unstable tones being added to the playback, and undoubtedly therefore violated the ISO standard. This also means that Nitrane was unlikely to have been based on the AMP software, and was more likely evidence of a hastily written MP3 decoder that didn't concern itself with standards compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mp3decoders.mp3-tech.org/decoders_winamp2_62.html|title=Winamp v2.62 mp3 decoding quality test results|website=mp3decoders.mp3-tech.org|access-date=September 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110191532/http://mp3decoders.mp3-tech.org/decoders_winamp2_62.html|archive-date=November 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nVersion 1.90, released March 31, 1998, was the first release as a general-purpose audio player, and documented on the Winamp website as supporting plugins, of which it included two input plugins (''MOD'' and ''MP3'') and a visualization plugin.<ref name=\"WAv1.90\"/>\nThe installer for Version 1.91, released 18 days later, included ''wave'', ''cdda'', and ''Windows tray handling'' plugins, as well as the famous [[Wesley Willis]]-inspired DEMO.MP3 file ''\"Winamp, it really whips the llama's ass\"''.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-17\"/><ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\nBy July 1998, Winamp's various versions had been downloaded over three million times.<ref name=Wired98/>\n\n=== Winamp 2 ===\n[[File:Winamp2.PNG|thumb|Winamp 2, shown with default Base Skin]]\n\nWinamp 2.0 was released on September 8, 1998. The 2.x versions were widely used and made Winamp one of the most [[download]]ed pieces of software for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"AutoMZ-18\"/> The new version improved the usability of the playlist, made the equalizer more accurate, introduced more plug-ins and allowed skins for the playlist and equalizer windows.\n\nPlayMedia filed a federal lawsuit against Nullsoft in March 1999. In May 1999, PlayMedia was granted an [[injunction]] by Federal Judge [[A. Howard Matz]] against distribution of Nitrane by Nullsoft, and the same month the lawsuit was settled out-of-court with licensing and confidentiality agreements.<ref name=Haring/> Soon after, Nullsoft switched to an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] decoder from the [[Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]], the developers of the MP3 format.\n\nWinamp 2.10, released March 24, 1999, included a new version of the \"Llama\" ''demo.mp3'' featuring a musical [[Sting (musical phrase)|sting]] and [[bleating]].\n\nNullsoft was purchased by [[AOL]] in June 1999 for $80&nbsp;million in stock, with Nullsoft becoming a subsidiary.<ref name=\"AOL1\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-19\"/> AOL itself merged with [[Time Warner]] in 2000.\n\nNullsoft relaunched the Winamp-specific winamp.com in December 1999 to provide easier access to skins, plug-ins, streaming audio, song downloads, forums, and developer resources.\n\nAs of June 22, 2000, Winamp surpassed 25 million registrants.<ref name=AOL1/>\n\n=== Winamp3 ===\nThe next major Winamp version, Winamp3 (so spelled to include ''mp3'' in the name and to mark its separation from the Winamp 2 codebase), was released on August 9, 2002. It was a complete rewrite of version 2, newly based on the [[Wasabi (software)|Wasabi]] application framework, which offered additional functionality and flexibility. Winamp3 was developed parallel to Winamp 2, but \"many users found it consumed too many system resources and was unstable (or even lacked some valued functionality, such as the ability to count or find the total duration of [[Song|tracks]] in a [[playlist]])\".<ref name=\"AutoMZ-20\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-21\"/> Winamp3 had no [[backward compatibility]] with Winamp 2 plugins, and the [[SHOUTcast]] sourcing plugin was not supported.  No Winamp3 version of SHOUTcast was ever released.\n\nIn response to users reverting to Winamp 2, Nullsoft continued the development of Winamp 2 to versions 2.9 and 2.91 in 2003,<ref name=\"AutoMZ-22\"/> even alluding to it humorously.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-23\"/> The [[beta version]]s 2.92 and 2.95 were released with the inclusion of some of the functionality of the upcoming Winamp 5. During this period the [[Wasabi (software)|Wasabi]] cross-platform [[Application software|application]] framework and [[Skin (computing)|skinnable]] [[GUI]] toolkit was derived from parts of the Winamp3 source code. For [[Linux]], Nullsoft released an [[alpha version]] of Winamp3 on October 9, 2001, but has not updated it despite continued user interest.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-24\"/>\n\nDuring this time Winamp faced stiff competition from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes]].<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\"/>\n\n=== Winamp 5 ===\n[[File:Winamp5.png|thumb|Winamp 5 featuring Winamp Modern skin]]\n\nWinamp 5 was based on the Winamp 2 codebase, but with Winamp3 features such as modern skins incorporated via a plugin,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=167493#post1261545 |title=\"Why no Winamp2 Download\" (post #4) |last=Richman |first=Eddy \"DJ Egg\"}} (forum post by developer)</ref> thus incorporating the main advantages of both products. Regarding the omission of a version 4, Nullsoft joked that \"nobody wants to see a Winamp 4 skin\" (\"4 skin\" being a pun on [[foreskin]]).<ref name=\"AutoMZ-25\"/> It was also joked that \"Winamp 5 is so good they skipped a number\" and \"Winamp 2+3=5,\".<ref name=\"AutoMZ-26\"/> Winamp 5.0 was released in December 2003.\n\nThe original Nullsoft team quit in 2004. As of version 5.1, Winamp development is credited to Ben Allison (Benski) and Maksim Tyrtyshny.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-30\"/><!-- Primary source, harmless for this purpose. -->\n\nFrom version 5.2 onwards, support for synchronizing with an [[iPod]] is built-in.<ref name=\"AutoMZ-27\"/>\n\n==== Winamp 5.5 ====\nWinamp 5.5: The 10th Anniversary Edition was released on October 10, 2007,<ref name=\"AutoMZ-28\"/> ten years after the first release of Winamp (a [[beta version|preview version]] had been released on September 10, 2007). New features to the player included album art support, improved localization support (with several officially localized Winamp releases, including German, Polish, Russian, and French), and a unified player and media library interface skin.  This version dropped support for [[Windows 9x]].<ref name=\"VanBuskirk\"/><ref name=\"AutoMZ-29\"/>\n\n==== Winamp 5.6 ====\n[[File:Winamp 5.621.PNG|thumb|Winamp 5.621, when listening to the [[SHOUTcast]] stream]]\nWinamp 5.6 features Android Wi-Fi support and direct mouse wheel support. Fraunhofer AAC codec with VBR encoding support was implemented. Moreover, the option to write ratings to tags (for MP3, WMA/WMV, [[Ogg]], and [[FLAC]]) was added. Hungarian and Indonesian installer translations and language packs were added.\n\nWith the release of Winamp version 5.66 on November 20, 2013, [[AOL]] announced that Winamp.com would shut down on December 20, 2013, and Winamp would cease to be offered for download after that date.<ref name=ars-shutdown />\n\nFive days later, version 5.666 was released with the \"Pro\" and \"Full\" installers being one and the same, in the process removing OpenCandy, Emusic, AOL Search, and AOL Toolbar from the installation bundle. This was announced to be the last release of Winamp from AOL/Nullsoft.<ref name=\"winamp5666post\" />\n\n==== Winamp 5.7 ====\nThere was a Winamp 5.7 beta program for an invitation-based Winamp Cloud feature, which would let Winamp play a user's entire cloud-stored music library across all supported devices.<ref name=\"winampcloud\" /> This feature would have allowed AOL to provide a music locker service that would essentially compete with other [[Comparison of online music lockers|online music lockers]]. The beta program was cancelled months before the announcement to shut down the Winamp project.<ref name=\"winampcloudabort\" />\n\n=== Acquisition by Radionomy ===\nOn November 20, 2013, AOL announced that on December 20, 2013, it would shut down Winamp.com, and the software would no longer be available for download, nor supported by the company after that date.<ref name=ars-shutdown /> The following day, an unofficial report surfaced that [[Microsoft]] was in talks with AOL to acquire Nullsoft.<ref name=verge-winampms>{{cite web|title=AOL reportedly wants to sell Winamp to Microsoft|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/21/5130536/microsoft-aol-reportedly-working-on-winamp-sale|work=The Verge|accessdate=November 21, 2013|date=November 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name=bw-winampms>{{cite web|title=Microsoft in Talks To Buy SHOUTcast And Winamp From AOL|url=http://www.broadcastingworld.com/news/view-476/|work=Broadcasting World|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}</ref> Despite AOL's announcement, the Winamp site was not shut down as planned, and on January 14, 2014, it was officially announced that Belgian online radio aggregator Radionomy had bought the Nullsoft brand, which includes Winamp and SHOUTcast.

The story revolves around a cardinal who, against his wishes, is [[Papal_conclave#Voting|elected]] [[pope]]. A psychoanalyst is called in to help the pope overcome his panic.<ref name=popesuffers /> The film premiered in Italy in April 2011 and played in competition at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival|64th Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn the death of the pope, the [[conclave]] meets in [[Rome]]. Early ballots end with black smoke, since none of the main candidates reaches the quorum. After several rounds of voting, Cardinal Melville is elected, though he had not previously been considered a frontrunner.\n\nAt the moment of the public announcement, with the faithful are gathered in [[St. Peter's Square]] and the cardinal proto-deacon ready to announce the name of the new pope, the newly elected pope has a panic attack and fails to appear on the balcony.\n\nThe spokesman of the [[Holy See]] evades questions from the press and the curiosity of the outside world by reporting that the new pontiff felt the need to sequester himself in prayer and reflection before being introduced to the public, and by explaining that he will make his official appearance within a few hours. This does not happen.\n\nIn accordance with the laws of the Church, until the identity of the new pope is announced publicly, the ceremony of election is not over and no one in the conclave can leave the Vatican.\n\nThe [[College of Cardinals]], deeply concerned by the crisis and the depression from which the new pope seems to be suffering, calls in the psychoanalyst Professor Brezzi (whose role is played by director Nanni Moretti). The cardinals react to the psychoanalyst with some suspicion, but still allow him to examine the new pope. Brezzi, in the presence of the cardinals, tries to initiate a psychotherapy session which, however, fails to reveal anything to explain the depression and helplessness that plague the pontiff.\n\nBrezzi reveals that his ex-wife is also a psychoanalyst and the newly elected pope is taken secretly to see her. After meeting with her he escapes his minders and runs away during a walk. Unaware of his absence, the cardinals kill time by playing games, ranging from cards to an international volleyball tournament organized by Brezzi.\n\nThe spokesman makes everyone believe that the Pope is in his quarters in prayer, and eventually the cardinals find Melville and give him another chance to announce his acceptance. Melville comes out onto the balcony claiming \"I am not the leader you need\", asks the crowd to pray \"for  what he is about to do\", and then retreats back into [[St. Peter's Basilica]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michel Piccoli]] as Cardinal Melville/[[The Pope]]\n* [[Nanni Moretti]] as the psychoanalyst\n* [[Jerzy Stuhr]] as spokesman\n* [[Massimo Dobrovic]] as [[Swiss Guard]]\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Cardinal Gregori\n* [[Margherita Buy]] as female psychoanalyst\n* [[Franco Graziosi]] as Cardinal Bollati\n* Leonardo Della Bianca as boy\n* Camilla Ridolfi as girl\n* [[Camillo Milli]] as Cardinal Pescardona\n* [[Roberto Nobile]] as Cardinal Cevasco\n* Gianluca Gobbi as Swiss Guard\n* Ulrich von Dobsch\u00fctz as Cardinal Brummer\n\n==Production==\n''We Have a Pope'' was announced in May 2009 as a co-production between Sacher Film, [[RAI|Rai Cinema]] and the French company Le Pacte.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marco|first=Camillo de|date=2009-05-21|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&documentID=108753|title=Le Pacte re-teams with Moretti for ''Abbiamo il Papa''|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref> Fandango joined as a co-producer later in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marco|first=Camillo de|date=2009-12-15|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&documentID=116319|title=Piccoli to play Pope for Moretti|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref> The production involved a budget of eight million euro.<ref name=popesuffers>{{Cite web|last=Scarpa|first=Vittoria|date=2011-04-14|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?treeID=850&documentID=201529|title=Moretti's ''Pope'' suffers from stress|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-04-15}}</ref> French actor [[Michel Piccoli]] was cast in the leading role after auditioning six scenes in Italian in August 2009.

The story revolves around a cardinal who, against his wishes, is elected [[pope]]. A psychoanalyst is called in to help the pope overcome his panic.<ref name=popesuffers /> The film premiered in Italy in April 2011 and played in competition at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival|64th Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn the death of the pope, the [[conclave]] meets in [[Rome]]. Early ballots end with black smoke, since none of the main candidates reaches the quorum. After several rounds of voting, Cardinal Melville is elected, though he had not previously been considered a frontrunner.\n\nAt the moment of the public announcement, with the faithful are gathered in [[St. Peter's Square]] and the cardinal proto-deacon ready to announce the name of the new pope, the newly elected pope has a panic attack and fails to appear on the balcony.\n\nThe spokesman of the [[Holy See]] evades questions from the press and the curiosity of the outside world by reporting that the new pontiff felt the need to sequester himself in prayer and reflection before being introduced to the public, and by explaining that he will make his official appearance within a few hours. This does not happen.\n\nIn accordance with the laws of the Church, until the identity of the new pope is announced publicly, the ceremony of election is not over and no one in the conclave can leave the Vatican.\n\nThe [[College of Cardinals]], deeply concerned by the crisis and the depression from which the new pope seems to be suffering, calls in the psychoanalyst Professor Brezzi (whose role is played by director Nanni Moretti). The cardinals react to the psychoanalyst with some suspicion, but still allow him to examine the new pope. Brezzi, in the presence of the cardinals, tries to initiate a psychotherapy session which, however, fails to reveal anything to explain the depression and helplessness that plague the pontiff.\n\nBrezzi reveals that his ex-wife is also a psychoanalyst and the newly elected pope is taken secretly to see her. After meeting with her he escapes his minders and runs away during a walk. Unaware of his absence, the cardinals kill time by playing games, ranging from cards to an international volleyball tournament organized by Brezzi.\n\nThe spokesman makes everyone believe that the Pope is in his quarters in prayer, and eventually the cardinals find Melville and give him another chance to announce his acceptance. Melville comes out onto the balcony claiming \"I am not the leader you need\", asks the crowd to pray \"for  what he is about to do\", and then retreats back into [[St. Peter's Basilica]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michel Piccoli]] as Cardinal Melville/[[The Pope]]\n* [[Nanni Moretti]] as the psychoanalyst\n* [[Jerzy Stuhr]] as spokesman\n* [[Massimo Dobrovic]] as [[Swiss Guard]]\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Cardinal Gregori\n* [[Margherita Buy]] as female psychoanalyst\n* [[Franco Graziosi]] as Cardinal Bollati\n* Leonardo Della Bianca as boy\n* Camilla Ridolfi as girl\n* [[Camillo Milli]] as Cardinal Pescardona\n* [[Roberto Nobile]] as Cardinal Cevasco\n* Gianluca Gobbi as Swiss Guard\n* Ulrich von Dobsch\u00fctz as Cardinal Brummer\n\n==Production==\n''We Have a Pope'' was announced in May 2009 as a co-production between Sacher Film, [[RAI|Rai Cinema]] and the French company Le Pacte.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marco|first=Camillo de|date=2009-05-21|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&documentID=108753|title=Le Pacte re-teams with Moretti for ''Abbiamo il Papa''|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref> Fandango joined as a co-producer later in the year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marco|first=Camillo de|date=2009-12-15|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&documentID=116319|title=Piccoli to play Pope for Moretti|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref> The production involved a budget of eight million euro.<ref name=popesuffers>{{Cite web|last=Scarpa|first=Vittoria|date=2011-04-14|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?treeID=850&documentID=201529|title=Moretti's ''Pope'' suffers from stress|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-04-15}}</ref> French actor [[Michel Piccoli]] was cast in the leading role after auditioning six scenes in Italian in August 2009.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.
