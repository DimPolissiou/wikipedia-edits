Most of Lake Powell, along with [[Rainbow Bridge National Monument]], is located in [[Utah]]. It is a major vacation spot visited by approximately two million people every year. It is the second largest man-made reservoir by maximum water capacity in the United States behind [[Lake Mead]], storing {{convert|24,322,000|acre.ft|m3}} of water when full. However, due to high water withdrawals for human and agricultural consumption, and because of subsequent droughts in the area, Lake Mead has fallen below Lake Powell in size several times during the 21st century in terms of volume of water, depth and surface area.\n\nLake Powell was created by the flooding of [[Glen Canyon]] by the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], which also led to the creation of [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], a popular summer destination. The reservoir is named for explorer [[John Wesley Powell]], a one-armed [[American Civil War]] veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869. In 1972, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established. It is public land managed by the [[National Park Service]], and available to the public for recreational purposes. It lies in parts of [[Garfield County, Utah|Garfield]], [[Kane County, Utah|Kane]], and [[San Juan County, Utah|San Juan]] counties in southern Utah, and [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] in northern Arizona. The northern limits of the lake extend at least as far as the [[Hite Crossing Bridge]].\n\nLake Powell is a water storage facility for the Upper Basin states of the [[Colorado River Compact]] ([[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[Wyoming]] and [[New Mexico]]). The Compact specifies that the Upper Basin states are to provide a minimum annual flow of {{convert|7500000|acre.ft|km3}} to the Lower Basin states (Arizona, Nevada, and California).\n\n==History==\n{{Update|section|reason=It refers to predictions for water year 2016|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn the 1940s and early 1950s, the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] planned to construct a series of Colorado River dams in the rugged Colorado Plateau province of Colorado, Utah, and Arizona. Glen Canyon Dam was born of a controversial damsite the Bureau selected in [[Echo Park (Colorado)|Echo Park]], in what is now [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in Colorado. A small but politically effective group of objectors led by [[David Brower]] of the [[Sierra Club]] succeeded in defeating the Bureau's bid, citing Echo Park's natural and scenic qualities as too valuable to submerge. By agreeing to a relocated damsite near Lee's Ferry between Glen and Grand Canyons, however, Brower did not realize what he had gambled away. At the time, Brower had not actually been to Glen Canyon. When he later saw Glen Canyon on a river trip, Brower discovered that it had the kind of scenic, cultural, and wilderness qualities often associated with America's national parks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Russell|title=A Story that Stands Like a Dam: Glen Canyon and the Struggle for the Soul of the West|date=1989|publisher=Henry Holt & Company|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-0822-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/storythatstandsl00russ}}</ref> Over 80 side canyons in the colorful Navajo Sandstone contained clear streams, abundant wildlife, arches, natural bridges, and numerous Native American archeological sites. By then, however, it was too late to stop the Bureau and its commissioner Floyd Dominy from building Glen Canyon Dam.  Brower believed the river should remain free, and would forever after consider the loss of Glen Canyon his life's ultimate disappointment.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=McPhee|first1=John|title=Encounters with the Archdruid|date=1971|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=0-374-14822-8}}</ref>\n\nGlen Canyon Dam was built to solve the downstream delivery obligations of the Upper Basin states.  Lake Powell is an \"aquatic bank\" built to fulfill the terms of the \"Compact Calls\" of Lower Basin.  If the Compact had required the Upper Basin to deliver ''half the flow'' of the Colorado in low water years, rather than ''a fixed amount'', the burden of drought would have been spread equally between the basins and there would have been no need to build the dam.  It's ironic that the lake is named after John Wesley Powell, who planned to settle the West based on the facts of hydrology, not politics.<ref>Grace, S.  \"Dam Nation\" 2012, PP 114.</ref>\n\n[[File:Glen Canyon Dam (1).jpg|thumb|left|Glen Canyon Dam in Page, Arizona|upright]]\nConstruction on [[Glen Canyon Dam]] began with a demolition blast keyed by the push of a button by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at his desk in the [[Oval Office]] on October 1, 1956. The first blast started clearing tunnels for water diversion. On February 11, 1959, water was diverted through the tunnels so dam construction could begin. Later that year, the bridge was completed, allowing trucks to deliver equipment and materials for the dam, and also for the new town of [[Page, Arizona]].\n\nConcrete placement started around the clock on June 17, 1960. The last bucket of concrete was poured on September 13, 1963. Over 5 million cubic yards (4,000,000 m\u00b3) of concrete make up Glen Canyon Dam. The Dam is 710 feet (216 m) high, with the surface elevation of the water at full pool being approximately 3700 feet (1100 m). Construction of the Dam cost $155 million, and 18 lives were lost in the process. From 1970 to 1980, turbines and generators were installed for hydroelectricity. On September 22, 1966, Glen Canyon Dam was dedicated by [[Lady Bird Johnson]].\n\n[[File:Lake Powell - Arizona.JPG|thumb|Lake Powell in 2007]]\nUpon completion of Glen Canyon Dam on September 13, 1963, the Colorado River began to back up, no longer being diverted through the tunnels. The newly flooded Glen Canyon formed Lake Powell. Sixteen years elapsed before the lake filled to the {{convert|3700|ft|m}} level, on June 22, 1980. The lake level fluctuates considerably depending on the seasonal snow runoff from the Rocky Mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/rsvrs/ops/crsp_40_gc.html |title=Upper Colorado Region Water Resources Group : Lake Powell : Water Operations Data: Elevation, Content, Inflow & Release for last 40 Days |work=[[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] |year=2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317175947/http://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/rsvrs/ops/crsp_40_gc.html |archivedate=17 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/crsp/cs/gcd.html |title=Upper Colorado Region Water Operations: Current Status: Lake Powell |work=United States Bureau of Reclamation |year=2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310092001/http://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/crsp/cs/gcd.html |archivedate=10 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azgfd.gov/h_f/edits/lake_levels.shtml |title=Lake Levels/River Flow |work=[[Arizona Game and Fish Department]] |year=2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716011638/http://www.azgfd.gov/h_f/edits/lake_levels.shtml |archivedate=16 July 2010 }}</ref> The all-time highest water level was reached on July 14, 1983, during one of the heaviest Colorado River floods in recorded history, in part influenced by a strong [[1982-83 El Ni\u00f1o Event|El Ni\u00f1o event]].

However, the Bureau of Reclamation in 2014 reduced the Lake Powell release from 8.23 to 7.48 million acre-feet, for the first time since the lake filled in 1980. This was done due to the \"equalization\" guideline which stipulates that an approximately equal amount of water must be retained in both Lake Powell and [[Lake Mead]], in order to preserve hydro-power generation capacity at both lakes. This resulted in Lake Mead declining to the lowest level on record since the 1930s.\n\n== Climate ==\nThese data are for the Wahweap climate station on Lake Powell just south of the Utah-Arizona border.\n{{Weather box|Jan record high F=69|Jan high F=47.2|Jan low F=26.9|Jan record low F=-2|Jan precipitation inch=0.59|Jan snow inch=0.2|Feb record high F=78|Feb high F=53.8|Feb low F=31.8|Feb record low F=4|Feb precipitation inch=0.56|Feb snow inch=0.2|Mar record high F=85|Mar high F=63.0|Mar low F=37.8|Mar record low F=21|Mar precipitation inch=0.63|Mar snow inch=0|Apr record high F=94|Apr high F=72.8|Apr low F=44.6|Apr record low F=16|Apr precipitation inch=0.37|Apr snow inch=0|May record high F=104|May high F=83.8|May low F=54.9|May record low F=29|May precipitation inch=0.36|May snow inch=0|Jun record high F=110|Jun high F=94.1|Jun low F=64.1|Jun record low F=40|Jun precipitation inch=0.17|Jun snow inch=0|Jul record high F=120|Jul high F=98.8|Jul low F=71.3|Jul record low F=48|Jul precipitation inch=0.51|Jul snow inch=0|Aug record high F=115|Aug high F=95.7|Aug low F=69.3|Aug record low F=51|Aug precipitation inch=0.75|Aug snow inch=0|Sep record high F=105|Sep high F=87.7|Sep low F=60.7|Sep record low F=36|Sep precipitation inch=0.59|Sep snow inch=0|Oct record high F=96|Oct high F=73.7|Oct low F=48.9|Oct record low F=24|Oct precipitation inch=0.85|Oct snow inch=0|Nov record high F=80|Nov high F=58.3|Nov low F=36.9|Nov record low F=15|Nov precipitation inch=0.57|Nov snow inch=0|Dec record high F=70|Dec low F=27.4|Dec high F=47.1|Dec record low F=3|Dec precipitation inch=0.41|Dec snow inch=0.3|single line=Y|precipitation colour=green|location=Wahweap, AZ|source 1=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?az9114}}\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Lake Powell Landscape.jpg|thumb|The southwestern portion of Lake Powell in Arizona]]\n[[File:Lac Powell 2016 Aerial view on Tower Butte.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Tower Butte (Arizona)]]\nGlen Canyon was carved by [[differential erosion]] from the Colorado River over an estimated 5 million years.  The [[Colorado Plateau]], through which the canyon cuts, arose some 11 million years ago.  Within that plateau lie layers of rock from over 300 million years ago to the relatively recent volcanic activity. [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] formations can be seen in [[Cataract Canyon]] and [[San Juan Canyon]]. The [[Moenkopi Formation]], which dates from 230 million years ago ([[Triassic Period]]), and the [[Chinle Formation]] are found at Lees Ferry and the Rincon.  Both formations are the result of the ancient inland sea that covered the area.  Once the sea drained, windblown sand invaded the area, creating what is known as [[Wingate Sandstone]].\n\nThe more recent ([[Jurassic Period]]) formations include [[Kayenta Sandstone]], which produces the trademark blue-black \"desert varnish\" that streaks down many walls of the canyons.  Above this is [[Navajo Sandstone]].  Many of the arches, including Rainbow Bridge, lie at this transition point.  This period also includes light yellow [[Entrada Sandstone]], and the dark brown, almost purple [[Carmel Formation]].  These latter two can be seen on the tops of mesas around [[Wahweap, Lake Powell|Wahweap]], and the crown of Castle Rock and Tower Butte.  Above these layers lie the [[sandstone]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and [[shale]] of the [[Straight Cliffs Formation]] that underlies the [[Kaiparowits Plateau]] and [[San Rafael Swell]] to the north of the lake.\n\nThe confluences of the [[Escalante River|Escalante]], [[Dirty Devil River|Dirty Devil]] and [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]] rivers with the Colorado lie within Lake Powell.  The slower flow of the San Juan river has produced [[Incised meanders|goosenecks]] where {{convert|5|mi|km}} of river are contained within {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} on a straight line.\n\n\n[[File:Utah Rainbow Arch.jpg|thumb|Rainbow Bridge]]\n==Landmarks==\n*[[Glen Canyon Dam]], the dam that keeps Lake Powell the way it is today.

The cut has been deepened several times since then, to allow the use of the channel during droughts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azdailysun.com/news/local/deeper-lake-powell-shortcut-completed/article_a06f0d4e-d5a7-11e3-9e66-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Deeper Lake Powell shortcut completed|first=Todd Glasenapp Sun|last=Correspondent|website=azdailysun.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730034318/http://azdailysun.com/news/local/deeper-lake-powell-shortcut-completed/article_a06f0d4e-d5a7-11e3-9e66-001a4bcf887a.html|archivedate=2015-07-30}}</ref> During the protracted 21st century drought, however, the lake has dropped so quickly on several occasions that the cut dried up during the summer tourist season, most recently in 2013.

A substantial number of vessels on the lake do not have AIS transponders as there currently are no mandatory requirements for AIS usage for this body of water. Extra precautions must be taken with respect to boating safety, as the [[fractal]] nature of the lake's hydrologic surface area can allow vessels with limited charting equipment to become easily lost.\n\nThe burying of human (and pet) waste in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is prohibited. Anyone who camps farther than a quarter of a mile from a marina, however, must bring a [[portable toilet]].

The filtration of zooplankton by the mussels can negatively impact the feeding for some species of fish. Zebra and quagga mussels can attach to hard surfaces and build layers on underwater structures. The mussels are known to clog pipes including those in hydroelectric power systems, thus becoming a costly and time-consuming problem for water managers in the West.\n\nControl policies have recently been introduced to alleviate the hydroelectric problems as well as ecological problems faced by Western infestation. Beginning in 1999 Lake Powell began to visually monitor for the mussels.\n\nIn 2001 hot water boat decontamination sites were established at Wahweap, Bullfrog, and Halls Crossing marinas. In January 2007, zebra mussels were detected in Lake Mead and new action plans were announced to prevent the spread of mussels to Lake Powell.  In August 2007, preliminary testing was positive for zebra or quagga larvae in Lake Powell. These tests were deemed false positives, but adult quagga mussels were found in 2013.\n\nIn August 2010, Lake Powell was declared mussel free.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Lake Powell introduced a mandatory boat inspection for each watercraft entering the reservoir beginning in June 2009.  Effective June 29, 2009, every vessel entering Lake Powell must have a mussel certificate, although boat owners were allowed to self-certify. These measures were intended to help prevent vessels from transporting Zebra mussels into Lake Powell.\n\nDespite these measures, quagga mussel DNA was detected in 2012 and live mussels were found at a number of sites including the Wahweap Marina in Spring and Summer 2013. In June 2013 the NPS was attempting a diver-based eradication program to find and remove mussels before the lake became infested.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Martin, Russell, ''A Story That Stands Like a Dam: Glen Canyon and the Struggle for the Soul of the West,'' Henry Holt & Co, 1989\n* McPhee, John, \"Encounters with the Archdruid,\"  Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1971\n* Nichols, Tad, ''Glen Canyon: Images of a Lost World,'' Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press, 2000\n* Abbey, Edward, ''Desert Solitaire,'' Ballantine Books, 1985\n* {{cite magazine | last=Glick | first=Daniel | title=''A Dry Red Season: Uncovering the Glory of Glen Canyon,'' | magazine=[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] | date=April 2006 | url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0604/feature3/index.html | accessdate=2007-10-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807084142/http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0604/feature3/index.html | archive-date=2007-08-07 | url-status=dead }}\n* Farmer, Jared, ''Glen Canyon Dammed: Inventing Lake Powell and the Canyon Country,'' Tucson: The University of Arizona Press, 1999\n* Stiles, Jim, ''The Brief but Wonderful Return of Cathedral in the Desert,'' Salt Lake Tribune, June 7, 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lake Powell}}\n* [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/lake_powell.php Water Level in Lake Powell], slide show of ten years of images from NASA\u2019s [[Landsat 5]] satellite, showing dramatic fluctuations in water levels in Lake Powell.\n* [http://lakepowell.water-data.com/ Lake Powell Water Database] -

Most of Lake Powell, along with [[Rainbow Bridge National Monument]], is located in [[Utah]]. It is a major vacation spot visited by approximately two million people every year. It is the second largest man-made reservoir by maximum water capacity in the United States behind [[Lake Mead]], storing {{convert|24,322,000|acre.ft|m3}} of water when full. However, due to high water withdrawals for human and agricultural consumption, and because of subsequent droughts in the area, Lake Mead has fallen below Lake Powell in size several times during the 21st century in terms of volume of water, depth and surface area.\n\nLake Powell was created by the flooding of [[Glen Canyon]] by the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], which also led to the creation of [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], a popular summer destination. The reservoir is named for explorer [[John Wesley Powell]], a one-armed [[American Civil War]] veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869. In 1972, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established. It is public land managed by the [[National Park Service]], and available to the public for recreational purposes. It lies in parts of [[Garfield County, Utah|Garfield]], [[Kane County, Utah|Kane]], and [[San Juan County, Utah|San Juan]] counties in southern Utah, and [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] in northern Arizona. The northern limits of the lake extend at least as far as the [[Hite Crossing Bridge]].\n\nLake Powell is a water storage facility for the Upper Basin states of the [[Colorado River Compact]] ([[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[Wyoming]] and [[New Mexico]]). The Compact specifies that the Upper Basin states are to provide a minimum annual flow of {{convert|7500000|acre.ft|km3}} to the Lower Basin states (Arizona, Nevada, and California).\n\n==History==\n{{Update|section|reason=It refers to predictions for water year 2016|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn the 1940s and early 1950s, the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] planned to construct a series of Colorado River dams in the rugged Colorado Plateau province of Colorado, Utah, and Arizona. Glen Canyon Dam was born of a controversial damsite the Bureau selected in [[Echo Park (Colorado)|Echo Park]], in what is now [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in Colorado. A small but politically effective group of objectors led by [[David Brower]] of the [[Sierra Club]] succeeded in defeating the Bureau's bid, citing Echo Park's natural and scenic qualities as too valuable to submerge. By agreeing to a relocated damsite near Lee's Ferry between Glen and Grand Canyons, however, Brower did not realize what he had gambled away. At the time, Brower had not actually been to Glen Canyon. When he later saw Glen Canyon on a river trip, Brower discovered that it had the kind of scenic, cultural, and wilderness qualities often associated with America's national parks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Russell|title=A Story that Stands Like a Dam: Glen Canyon and the Struggle for the Soul of the West|date=1989|publisher=Henry Holt & Company|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-0822-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/storythatstandsl00russ}}</ref> Over 80 side canyons in the colorful Navajo Sandstone contained clear streams, abundant wildlife, arches, natural bridges, and numerous Native American archeological sites. By then, however, it was too late to stop the Bureau and its commissioner Floyd Dominy from building Glen Canyon Dam.  Brower believed the river should remain free, and would forever after consider the loss of Glen Canyon his life's ultimate disappointment.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=McPhee|first1=John|title=Encounters with the Archdruid|date=1971|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=0-374-14822-8}}</ref>\n\nGlen Canyon Dam was built to solve the downstream delivery obligations of the Upper Basin states.  Lake Powell is an \"aquatic bank\" built to fulfill the terms of the \"Compact Calls\" of Lower Basin.  If the Compact had required the Upper Basin to deliver ''half the flow'' of the Colorado in low water years, rather than ''a fixed amount'', the burden of drought would have been spread equally between the basins and there would have been no need to build the dam.  It's ironic that the lake is named after John Wesley Powell, who planned to settle the West based on the facts of hydrology, not politics.<ref>Grace, S.  \"Dam Nation\" 2012, PP 114.</ref>\n\n[[File:Glen Canyon Dam (1).jpg|thumb|left|Glen Canyon Dam in Page, Arizona|upright]]\nConstruction on [[Glen Canyon Dam]] began with a demolition blast keyed by the push of a button by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at his desk in the [[Oval Office]] on October 1, 1956. The first blast started clearing tunnels for water diversion. On February 11, 1959, water was diverted through the tunnels so dam construction could begin. Later that year, the bridge was completed, allowing trucks to deliver equipment and materials for the dam, and also for the new town of [[Page, Arizona]].\n\nConcrete placement started around the clock on June 17, 1960. The last bucket of concrete was poured on September 13, 1963. Over 5 million cubic yards (4,000,000 m\u00b3) of concrete make up Glen Canyon Dam. The Dam is 710 feet (216 m) high, with the surface elevation of the water at full pool being approximately 3700 feet (1100 m). Construction of the Dam cost $155 million, and 18 lives were lost in the process. From 1970 to 1980, turbines and generators were installed for hydroelectricity. On September 22, 1966, Glen Canyon Dam was dedicated by [[Lady Bird Johnson]].\n\n[[File:Lake Powell - Arizona.JPG|thumb|Lake Powell in 2007]]\nUpon completion of Glen Canyon Dam on September 13, 1963, the Colorado River began to back up, no longer being diverted through the tunnels. The newly flooded Glen Canyon formed Lake Powell. Sixteen years elapsed before the lake filled to the {{convert|3700|ft|m}} level, on June 22, 1980.

However, the Bureau of Reclamation in 2014 reduced the Lake Powell release from 8.23 to 7.48 million acre-feet, for the first time since the lake filled in 1980. This was done due to the \"equalization\" guideline which stipulates that an approximately equal amount of water must be retained in both Lake Powell and [[Lake Mead]], in order to preserve hydro-power generation capacity at both lakes. This resulted in Lake Mead declining to the lowest level on record since the 1930s.\n\n== Climate ==\nThese data are for the Wahweap climate station on Lake Powell just south of the Utah-Arizona border.\n{{Weather box|Jan record high F=69|Jan high F=47.2|Jan low F=26.9|Jan record low F=-2|Jan precipitation inch=0.59|Jan snow inch=0.2|Feb record high F=78|Feb high F=53.8|Feb low F=31.8|Feb record low F=4|Feb precipitation inch=0.56|Feb snow inch=0.2|Mar record high F=85|Mar high F=63.0|Mar low F=37.8|Mar record low F=21|Mar precipitation inch=0.63|Mar snow inch=0|Apr record high F=94|Apr high F=72.8|Apr low F=44.6|Apr record low F=16|Apr precipitation inch=0.37|Apr snow inch=0|May record high F=104|May high F=83.8|May low F=54.9|May record low F=29|May precipitation inch=0.36|May snow inch=0|Jun record high F=110|Jun high F=94.1|Jun low F=64.1|Jun record low F=40|Jun precipitation inch=0.17|Jun snow inch=0|Jul record high F=120|Jul high F=98.8|Jul low F=71.3|Jul record low F=48|Jul precipitation inch=0.51|Jul snow inch=0|Aug record high F=115|Aug high F=95.7|Aug low F=69.3|Aug record low F=51|Aug precipitation inch=0.75|Aug snow inch=0|Sep record high F=105|Sep high F=87.7|Sep low F=60.7|Sep record low F=36|Sep precipitation inch=0.59|Sep snow inch=0|Oct record high F=96|Oct high F=73.7|Oct low F=48.9|Oct record low F=24|Oct precipitation inch=0.85|Oct snow inch=0|Nov record high F=80|Nov high F=58.3|Nov low F=36.9|Nov record low F=15|Nov precipitation inch=0.57|Nov snow inch=0|Dec record high F=70|Dec low F=27.4|Dec high F=47.1|Dec record low F=3|Dec precipitation inch=0.41|Dec snow inch=0.3|single line=Y|precipitation colour=green|location=Wahweap, AZ|source 1=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?az9114}}\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Lake Powell Landscape.jpg|thumb|The southwestern portion of Lake Powell in Arizona]]\n[[File:Lac Powell 2016 Aerial view on Tower Butte.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Tower Butte (Arizona)]]\nGlen Canyon was carved by [[differential erosion]] from the Colorado River over an estimated 5 million years.  The [[Colorado Plateau]], through which the canyon cuts, arose some 11 million years ago.  Within that plateau lie layers of rock from over 300 million years ago to the relatively recent volcanic activity. [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] formations can be seen in [[Cataract Canyon]] and [[San Juan Canyon]]. The [[Moenkopi Formation]], which dates from 230 million years ago ([[Triassic Period]]), and the [[Chinle Formation]] are found at Lees Ferry and the Rincon.  Both formations are the result of the ancient inland sea that covered the area.  Once the sea drained, windblown sand invaded the area, creating what is known as [[Wingate Sandstone]].\n\nThe more recent ([[Jurassic Period]]) formations include [[Kayenta Sandstone]], which produces the trademark blue-black \"desert varnish\" that streaks down many walls of the canyons.  Above this is [[Navajo Sandstone]].  Many of the arches, including Rainbow Bridge, lie at this transition point.  This period also includes light yellow [[Entrada Sandstone]], and the dark brown, almost purple [[Carmel Formation]].  These latter two can be seen on the tops of mesas around [[Wahweap, Lake Powell|Wahweap]], and the crown of Castle Rock and Tower Butte.  Above these layers lie the [[sandstone]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and [[shale]] of the [[Straight Cliffs Formation]] that underlies the [[Kaiparowits Plateau]] and [[San Rafael Swell]] to the north of the lake.\n\nThe confluences of the [[Escalante River|Escalante]], [[Dirty Devil River|Dirty Devil]] and [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]] rivers with the Colorado lie within Lake Powell.  The slower flow of the San Juan river has produced [[Incised meanders|goosenecks]] where {{convert|5|mi|km}} of river are contained within {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} on a straight line.\n\n\n[[File:Utah Rainbow Arch.jpg|thumb|Rainbow Bridge]]\n==Landmarks==\n*[[Glen Canyon Dam]], the dam that keeps Lake Powell the way it is today.

The cut has been deepened several times since then, to allow the use of the channel during droughts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azdailysun.com/news/local/deeper-lake-powell-shortcut-completed/article_a06f0d4e-d5a7-11e3-9e66-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Deeper Lake Powell shortcut completed|first=Todd Glasenapp Sun|last=Correspondent|website=azdailysun.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730034318/http://azdailysun.com/news/local/deeper-lake-powell-shortcut-completed/article_a06f0d4e-d5a7-11e3-9e66-001a4bcf887a.html|archivedate=2015-07-30}}</ref> During the protracted 21st century drought, however, the lake has dropped so quickly on several occasions that the cut dried up during the summer tourist season, most recently in 2013.

A substantial number of vessels on the lake do not have AIS transponders as there currently are no mandatory requirements for AIS usage for this body of water. Extra precautions must be taken with respect to boating safety, as the [[fractal]] nature of the lake's hydrologic surface area can allow vessels with limited charting equipment to become easily lost.\n\nThe burying of human (and pet) waste in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is prohibited.

The filtration of zooplankton by the mussels can negatively impact the feeding for some species of fish. Zebra and quagga mussels can attach to hard surfaces and build layers on underwater structures. The mussels are known to clog pipes including those in hydroelectric power systems, thus becoming a costly and time-consuming problem for water managers in the West.\n\nControl policies have recently been introduced to alleviate the hydroelectric problems as well as ecological problems faced by Western infestation. Beginning in 1999 Lake Powell began to visually monitor for the mussels.\n\nIn 2001 hot water boat decontamination sites were established at Wahweap, Bullfrog, and Halls Crossing marinas. In January 2007, zebra mussels were detected in Lake Mead and new action plans were announced to prevent the spread of mussels to Lake Powell.  In August 2007, preliminary testing was positive for zebra or quagga larvae in Lake Powell. These tests were deemed false positives, but adult quagga mussels were found in 2013.\n\nIn August 2010, Lake Powell was declared mussel free.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Lake Powell introduced a mandatory boat inspection for each watercraft entering the reservoir beginning in June 2009.  Effective June 29, 2009, every vessel entering Lake Powell must have a mussel certificate, although boat owners were allowed to self-certify. These measures were intended to help prevent vessels from transporting Zebra mussels into Lake Powell.\n\nDespite these measures, quagga mussel DNA was detected in 2012 and live mussels were found at a number of sites including the Wahweap Marina in Spring and Summer 2013. In June 2013 the NPS was attempting a diver-based eradication program to find and remove mussels before the lake became infested.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Martin, Russell, ''A Story That Stands Like a Dam: Glen Canyon and the Struggle for the Soul of the West,'' Henry Holt & Co, 1989\n* McPhee, John, \"Encounters with the Archdruid,\"  Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1971\n* Nichols, Tad, ''Glen Canyon: Images of a Lost World,'' Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press, 2000\n* Abbey, Edward, ''Desert Solitaire,'' Ballantine Books, 1985\n* {{cite magazine | last=Glick | first=Daniel | title=''A Dry Red Season: Uncovering the Glory of Glen Canyon,'' | magazine=[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] | date=April 2006 | url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0604/feature3/index.html | accessdate=2007-10-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807084142/http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0604/feature3/index.html | archive-date=2007-08-07 | url-status=dead }}\n* Farmer, Jared, ''Glen Canyon Dammed: Inventing Lake Powell and the Canyon Country,'' Tucson: The University of Arizona Press, 1999\n* Stiles, Jim, ''The Brief but Wonderful Return of Cathedral in the Desert,'' Salt Lake Tribune, June 7, 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lake Powell}}\n* [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/lake_powell.php Water Level in Lake Powell], slide show of ten years of images from NASA\u2019s [[Landsat 5]] satellite, showing dramatic fluctuations in water levels in Lake Powell.\n* [http://lakepowell.water-data.com/ Lake Powell Water Database] - water level, basin snowpack, and other statistics\n* [http://www.lakepowell.com Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas]\n* [http://www.lakepowell.org Friends of Lake Powell] - organization opposed to decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam\n* [http://www.nps.gov/glca/ Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (National Park Service)]\n\n\n{{CRSP}}\n{{Colorado_River_system}}\n{{Glen Canyon National Recreation Area}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lake Powell| ]]\n[[Category:Reservoirs in Arizona|Powell]]\n[[Category:Reservoirs in Utah|Powell]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Colorado River]]\n[[Category:Reservoirs in Coconino County, Arizona|Powell]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Coconino County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Lakes of Garfield County, Utah|Powell]]\n[[Category:Lakes of Kane County, Utah|Powell]]\n[[Category:Lakes of San Juan County, Utah|Powell]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Garfield County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Kane County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in San Juan County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Reservoirs and dams in National Park Service units|Powell]]\n[[Category:Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in San Juan County, Utah]]\n[[Category:Colorado River Storage Project]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Utah]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Arizona]]\n", "name_user": "HaveFunDoGood", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammatical edit.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Powell"}

Their work ethic, their commitment to principled and evidence-based decision making, and their care for people and the environment is unparalleled. I also feel strongly that we need better representation and more progressive ideas within the federal Green Party and politics in Canada as a whole. As an LGBTQ2+ person of colour, Amita brings much-needed representation and I know their views to be progressive, thoughtful and based on science, facts and research. I wholeheartedly endorse Amita Kuttner in their bid to be leader of the Green Party of Canada. }}</ref> \n;'''Organizations:'''\n;'''Media:'''\n}}\n\n===David Merner===\n[[File:David Merner 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|David Merner]]\n;Background:\nDavid Merner, 57, is the Green Party Critic for Justice (2018-present), and was the Green Party candidate for [[Esquimalt\u2014Saanich\u2014Sooke]] in 2019.

{"title_page": "Liam Mellows Branch", "text_new": "The '''Liam Mellows Branch''' was a short-lived [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] branch in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] which existed in the mid 1940s. It became infamous for what was during that period its extremely controversial nature. It was in this branch that [[Michael O'Riordan]] and [[Timothy Quill]] publicly became infracturable enemies. It also led to the creation of the [[Cork Socialist Party]], of which O'Riordan stood as a general election candidate. The branch was named after [[Irish people|Irish]] revolutionary [[Liam Mellows]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Communism and Cork Labour ===\nThe Party in Cork from its earliest days saw its brand as Irish and Christian with no interaction with socialist movements in Europe. Examples of 'good' Labour movements were listed by public representatives such as T.J Murphy were the UK, New Zealand and Australia. In the years after the [[Russian Revolution]], national figures such as [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]], Cathal O'Shannon and [[William X. O'Brien|William O'Brien]] were supportive of the Irish Socialist Party and the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], but such support was rarely evident in Cork. Criticism on Soviet communist doctrine came largely from the [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and prominent Catholic lay people such as [[Alfred O'Rahilly]]. The two main political parties (Fianna Fail in particular) were also constantly labelling the Labour Party as communist. The local media in particular such as ''[[The Southern Star (County Cork)|The Southern Star]]'' and ''[[The Cork Examiner]]'' were equally vehement of their criticism of communist influences. However, Labour politicians, both in city and county, were critical of the Soviet Union in terms of its lack of democracy, its anti religious sentiment and that no [[trade union]] structures existed as they understood it.\n\nThe Labour Party in Cork was constantly on the defensive electorally to deny any connection with communism, which was linked with being anti-Catholic. Labour were seen as pro-communist as they were seen to attack the rights to property, they accepted the principle of class conflict and regularly criticised the capitalist system. They called for land distribution from 'ranchers' to farm labourers and the compulsory acquisition of land for house building if local farmers would not sell land. Labour meetings and public representatives regularly called for certain industries to be given state aid or be taken into public ownership while national policy also called for nationalisation of certain industries such as railways. They also recognised that there was class conflict in society which was contrary to Church social teaching and the views of other political parties. Labour figures constantly criticised the capitalist system which ''<nowiki/>'has taken control of the hearts and minds of men and has made them selfish. It has set man against man, leaving most in poverty'''.\n\nLabour argued for the State to have more control of the money system, the need to establish municipal banks and they criticised the amount of money held in banks with so much poverty in both the city and the countryside. In the city, there was some initial support for the Russian Revolution, as evidenced in the use of the Soviet flag in the Cork Soviet in 1921. However, this was short lived as the preoccupation with Labour leaders in Cork focussed on trade union issues, such as employment creation, poverty, housing, education and a philosophy based on Christian social teaching. The tradition that the Labour leadership in the county came from either a trade union background (particularly the IT&GWU) and the land agitation movements such as the Land and Labour Association, which was socially Christian in nature. Some unions were also quite socially Christian in nature and influential, such as the INTO. Many of the INTO branches were affiliated to the Party in Cork and individual members also took up officerships in a number of branches. This was at a time when the Church exerted enormous amounts of influence in primary schools. INTO members were strenuously opposed to communist influence. An example of this was at the 1931 [[Cork West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork West]] selection convention. A motion from Sean O'Sullivan NT Drimoleague and John O'Sullivan NT Bantry proposed ''<nowiki/>'that the Labour Party and unions at this conference... utter detestation of any form of communism or other doctrines to our Catholic faith.'<nowiki/>'' The motion was adopted. Speaking on the motion, TJ Murphy expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'Communism was subversive to the Catholic Faith and morals and interfered with our national ideals. Labour would not exclude anti-Catholics but would not exclude accept communist or Bolshevik doctrines'<nowiki/>''. 14 Cork branches and unions including INTO branches from Dunmanway, Bantry, Skibbereen, Macroom, IT&GWU branches from Dunmanway and Bandon, NUR Dunmanway and Bandon Carpenters Union reflected the widespread support for the motion. Similar sentiments were expressed at branch meetings and at political meetings in the mid 1930s, such as Quill in Leap, Murphy in Aghada and the Kilmichael and Buttevant branches. Murphy argued ''<nowiki/>'European countries are blighted by fascism or communism, forces that are filled with hatred threatening civilisation.'''\n\nUnions affiliated to the Labour Party expressed similar sentiments. In 1936, the Buttevant Branch wrote to the new Bishop of Cloyne stating ''<nowiki/>'we the members of the Buttevant Branch of the Labour Party do hereby solemly affirm our beliefs in the Commandants of God and are prepared to oppose with all legitimate means at our disposal any party who may constitute themselves as propagandists for the teaching of communism in our island.'<nowiki/>'' In 1937, T. Moylan, NUR Mallow stated that there was no affiliation between Labour and communists and that changing the conditions of the poor did not constitute communism. The INTO Branch meeting in Kanturk passed a motion that union funding to the Labour Party should not be used to enable the Party to affiliate with Continental movements of communistic tendencies. The 1940s saw little changes in the attacks on Labour and their trenchant details on communist lines. Eileen Crowley, a candidate in the city elections in 1943 expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'we need to put in practise the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church'''. James Hickey, at a meeting in Bandon at the same time, echoed similar sentiments. When Sean McEntee of Fianna Fail attacked Labour communist tendencies at an election meeting, TJ Murphy repudiated his attacks stating that the Party supports the papal encyclicals and the laws of Catholicism to deal with the problems of the time. \n\nIn 1943, the North-West Branch met in the Butter Exchange Band room. Members felt there were misconceptions in the use of the term in the Party constitution 'Irish Workers Republic'. The Branch approved the use of the title of ''<nowiki/>'An Irish Workers Republic as laid down in the 1916 Proclamation and stated that as workers we do not need inspiration form Russia, Spain or Mexico'''.The Irish Labour Party would recognise the right to private ownership, freedom of the press and religious liberty, the resolution concluded. The term 'Workers Republic' in the constitution was said to be problematic. It was seen by members of society and the Labour Party to be pro-Soviet. The INTO in particular were influential, both nationally and in Cork, in opposing the use of the term. They believe it went beyond Catholic social teaching and when the term was referred to the Bishops for their view, it signalled the triumph of Catholicism. The onslaught of the Church, Catholic lay speakers, the press and other political parties was too much and the Catholic ethos in the party was very strong. The right to private property and the belief that Labour was a party of public ownership had also been opposed and cost the Party support that went to Fianna Fail.\n\nThe civil and political antagonism to Labour and the threat of socialism/communism was expressed at a lecture of Corporate State by Professor Hogan of UCC I May 1934. Attended by William T. Cosgrave and many in CnaG/ FG party, the lecture was entitled 'Corporate State \u2013 An Alternative to Capitalism and Socialism'. Hogan deemed socialism to be a threat and the state needed an alternative which the corporate state provides, based on Christian social teaching and the removal of the issue of class politics. Socialists, he argued, sought class conflict and Irish trade unionists deny that they are Marxists, yet subscribe to the class war idea. However, Christian trade unions in Holland and Belgium were working the principles contained in the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum', where capital and labour come together and co-operate successfully, he concluded.\n\nThe press offered little support, with a Cork Examiner editorial in 1947 dismissing the Labour view that capitalism was not working and that free enterprise was being replaced by monopolies. The editorial argued that communism would not deliver utopia, that the right to property was sacrosanct and that free enterprise and not state controls or monopolies was the way forward. The Labour Party fear as being seen as supporting communism or indeed being infiltrated by communists is seen in how Labour reacted to a new branch of the Party in the City.\n\n== Foundation of the branch ==\n\n==== The Liam Mellows Branch ====\nFrom 1935, the Party organisation had endeavoured to establish a number of branches around the city. Blarney Street was one of the areas identified by the Organisation Committee but it was not until 1943 on the initiative of Michael O'Riordan that a branch was formed there in February. A number of men involved in the Connolly Group in the Curragh joined him. The branch was named in honour of [[Liam Mellows]]. Naming a branch after someone such as Mellows was unusual for the party and the suspicion of communist influence may have been a factor in the branch being viewed with mistrust. The new branch set up meeting rooms in 16 North Main Street and in November 1943 held their inaugural meeting with then Lord Mayor, [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]], opening the meeting. Quill was elected as Chair, Bill Nagle as vice-chair, Michael O'Riordan as secretary, Minutes Secretary Jim Savage (whom was also a delegate to the Constituency Council) and Marie Keohane as Treasurer. A committee comprising Mrs J Hurley, Ellen Crowley B.A, Derry Kelleher, Jim Savage, Vincent Crotty, Tommy Murray (father of Labour Lord Mayor John Murray) and D.Sheehan elected. The initial report seems to show that Seamus Ronayne was elected as Treasurer but Keohane appears to have acted as branch Treasurer. The Press Release issued after the first meeting stated that 40 members enrolled, that an Organising Committee set out proposed activities and its attitude to the Irish language. The title 'Craobh' rather than 'Branch' was used. Such use of the language was unusual for a Labour Party branch.\n\nThe Branch took out short advertisements for a series of public lectures, describing themselves in those as Craobh Mhaoillosa (Labour Party). The branch became active locally organising public lectures engaged with the trade unions not affiliated with the party and would send delegations to meetings of the Corporation raising issues such as housing. Many of these activities were standard for other Labour branches at the time but the Blarney Street branch appears to have been more energetic and organised in its activities. Branch established a reputation as a dynamic branch and its rapid development appears to all much to all religions organised organisational skills. The branch set up premises in 75 North Main Street premises on the site of the old Boiler Makers' Trade Union and organised a series of public lectures held in the North Main Street premises. Some of the lectures included branch members presenting talks on Liam Mellows, 'The Indian Question', 'Science and Socialism', the Irish language, 'England and the Irish Question', social security and 'The Jewish Question'.\n\n===== O'Riordan accuses Quill of Anti-Semitism =====\nO'Riordan asserts that Quill was imposed on the Liam Mellows Branch as Chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also argued that the talk on the Jewish question arose following comments made by Timothy Quill on ''<nowiki/>'Jew Boys'''. [[Gerald Goldberg]] was present at the talk and was so impressed by O'Riordan that he subsequently donated \u00a35 to the branch. Quill, perhaps irritated by the talk demanded that the money be returned. \n\n===== 2001 Labour Party Conference =====\nO'Riordan, in a speech to the 2001 Labour Party Conference, stated that ''\"I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the party' with Jewish money. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled by the party.\"''<blockquote>''\"Following my release from the Curragh Camp and my return to Cork in 1943, I was among those who founded the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party in the hope that it might become the political voice of Irish anti-fascism in this city. I was named secretary of that branch but unfortunately the chairman we were given by the Party leadership was a Cork City Councillor who would debase the name of Labour in 1944 by a vitriolic attack on what he called \"the Jew boys\" of Cork. It was in opposition to such anti-Semitism that I insisted on giving a public lecture under the auspices of the Liam Mellows Branch on the subject of the Jewish question. A number of prominent members of Cork's Jewish community attended that public meeting and the future Lord Mayor of Cork, Gerald Goldberg, said from the floor: \"I came here to defend my people, but when I heard the lecturer I saw there was no need\". But the anti-Semitic Labour Councillor did not give up. When Gerald Goldberg subsequently made a donation to branch funds I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the Party with Jewish money'. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled from a Party that was not prepared to support my continuing anti-fascist stand in 1944.\"''</blockquote>While there is merit to this claim, it does appear to be more complex than this account. Antisemitism did exist in the city at this time and Quill was a devout Catholic. Barry Desmond in his book ''<nowiki/>'No Workers Republic''' testifies to the antisemitic feeling in the city at the time. There was a strong anti-communist sentiment within Labour and the party had been constantly assailed in the city by professor Alfred O'Rahilly and many figures within the Roman Church, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. The Communist Party in Eire had been disbanded but the NI party still existed. O'Riordan and Nagle attended the NI Communist Party conference in Belfast in October 1943 with four Labour members (including John De Courcey Ireland).\n\nA report in [[The Irish Press|''The'' ''Irish Press'']] suggests that the Administrative Council ''<nowiki/>'had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch'''. This was headed up by vice-chair, TJ Murphy. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. O'Riordan maintained that he had only attended to meet former comrades socially. Following an investigation, the committee recommended the expulsion of both and the decision was approved of by the Parliamentary Party. The two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. Both decisions were ratified by the annual conference that year. But there are no reports or minutes of O'Riordan being expelled by the party locally on the Jewish episode but it is likely that it played a role in the expulsions. Likewise, it is clear that Timothy Quill, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views as possibly anti-Semitic views. The perceived threat of Soviet communism was perhaps the reason that Timothy Quill was nominated as Chair of the Liam Mellows Branch. It was around this time that the IT&GWU disaffiliated from Labour and the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] and separate Trade Union Congress on the basis that Soviets were infiltrating the Labour Party.\n\n===== Labour vs National Labour =====\nOne incident involving the branch illustrates the divisions within the party in the city. ''The Cork Examiner'' reported in August 1944 that a deputation of three members of the Liam Mellows Branch spoke at a meeting Cork Corporation on the issue of juvenile offenders in the city. They requested a commission to review the issue and that a system of 'constructive reformation' rather than prison punishment take place. After the deputation left the meeting, PJ O'Brien of the National Labour Party launched an attack on the delegation stating that these were members of the Labour Party who sought to introduce 'neo communism' into Cork.

It became infamous for what was during that period its extremely controversial nature. It was in this branch that [[Michael O'Riordan]] and [[Timothy Quill]] publicly became infracturable enemies. It also led to the creation of the [[Cork Socialist Party]], of which O'Riordan stood as a general election candidate. The branch was named after [[Irish people|Irish]] revolutionary [[Liam Mellows]].\n\n=== Communism and Cork Labour ===\nThe Party in Cork from its earliest days saw its brand as Irish and Christian with no interaction with socialist movements in Europe. Examples of 'good' Labour movements were listed by public representatives such as T.J Murphy were the UK, New Zealand and Australia. In the years after the [[Russian Revolution]], national figures such as [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]], Cathal O'Shannon and [[William X. O'Brien|William O'Brien]] were supportive of the Irish Socialist Party and the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], but such support was rarely evident in Cork. Criticism on Soviet communist doctrine came largely from the [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and prominent Catholic lay people such as [[Alfred O'Rahilly]]. The two main political parties (Fianna Fail in particular) were also constantly labelling the Labour Party as communist. The local media in particular such as ''[[The Southern Star (County Cork)|The Southern Star]]'' and ''[[The Cork Examiner]]'' were equally vehement of their criticism of communist influences. However, Labour politicians, both in city and county, were critical of the Soviet Union in terms of its lack of democracy, its anti religious sentiment and that no [[trade union]] structures existed as they understood it.\n\nThe Labour Party in Cork was constantly on the defensive electorally to deny any connection with communism, which was linked with being anti-Catholic. Labour were seen as pro-communist as they were seen to attack the rights to property, they accepted the principle of class conflict and regularly criticised the capitalist system. They called for land distribution from 'ranchers' to farm labourers and the compulsory acquisition of land for house building if local farmers would not sell land. Labour meetings and public representatives regularly called for certain industries to be given state aid or be taken into public ownership while national policy also called for nationalisation of certain industries such as railways. They also recognised that there was class conflict in society which was contrary to Church social teaching and the views of other political parties. Labour figures constantly criticised the capitalist system which ''<nowiki/>'has taken control of the hearts and minds of men and has made them selfish. It has set man against man, leaving most in poverty'''.\n\nLabour argued for the State to have more control of the money system, the need to establish municipal banks and they criticised the amount of money held in banks with so much poverty in both the city and the countryside. In the city, there was some initial support for the Russian Revolution, as evidenced in the use of the Soviet flag in the Cork Soviet in 1921. However, this was short lived as the preoccupation with Labour leaders in Cork focussed on trade union issues, such as employment creation, poverty, housing, education and a philosophy based on Christian social teaching. The tradition that the Labour leadership in the county came from either a trade union background (particularly the IT&GWU) and the land agitation movements such as the Land and Labour Association, which was socially Christian in nature. Some unions were also quite socially Christian in nature and influential, such as the INTO. Many of the INTO branches were affiliated to the Party in Cork and individual members also took up officerships in a number of branches. This was at a time when the Church exerted enormous amounts of influence in primary schools. INTO members were strenuously opposed to communist influence. An example of this was at the 1931 [[Cork West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork West]] selection convention. A motion from Sean O'Sullivan NT Drimoleague and John O'Sullivan NT Bantry proposed ''<nowiki/>'that the Labour Party and unions at this conference... utter detestation of any form of communism or other doctrines to our Catholic faith.'<nowiki/>'' The motion was adopted. Speaking on the motion, TJ Murphy expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'Communism was subversive to the Catholic Faith and morals and interfered with our national ideals. Labour would not exclude anti-Catholics but would not exclude accept communist or Bolshevik doctrines'<nowiki/>''. 14 Cork branches and unions including INTO branches from Dunmanway, Bantry, Skibbereen, Macroom, IT&GWU branches from Dunmanway and Bandon, NUR Dunmanway and Bandon Carpenters Union reflected the widespread support for the motion. Similar sentiments were expressed at branch meetings and at political meetings in the mid 1930s, such as Quill in Leap, Murphy in Aghada and the Kilmichael and Buttevant branches. Murphy argued ''<nowiki/>'European countries are blighted by fascism or communism, forces that are filled with hatred threatening civilisation.'''\n\nUnions affiliated to the Labour Party expressed similar sentiments. In 1936, the Buttevant Branch wrote to the new Bishop of Cloyne stating ''<nowiki/>'we the members of the Buttevant Branch of the Labour Party do hereby solemly affirm our beliefs in the Commandants of God and are prepared to oppose with all legitimate means at our disposal any party who may constitute themselves as propagandists for the teaching of communism in our island.'<nowiki/>'' In 1937, T. Moylan, NUR Mallow stated that there was no affiliation between Labour and communists and that changing the conditions of the poor did not constitute communism. The INTO Branch meeting in Kanturk passed a motion that union funding to the Labour Party should not be used to enable the Party to affiliate with Continental movements of communistic tendencies. The 1940s saw little changes in the attacks on Labour and their trenchant details on communist lines. Eileen Crowley, a candidate in the city elections in 1943 expressed the view that ''<nowiki/>'we need to put in practise the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church'''. James Hickey, at a meeting in Bandon at the same time, echoed similar sentiments. When Sean McEntee of Fianna Fail attacked Labour communist tendencies at an election meeting, TJ Murphy repudiated his attacks stating that the Party supports the papal encyclicals and the laws of Catholicism to deal with the problems of the time. \n\nIn 1943, the North-West Branch met in the Butter Exchange Band room. Members felt there were misconceptions in the use of the term in the Party constitution 'Irish Workers Republic'. The Branch approved the use of the title of ''<nowiki/>'An Irish Workers Republic as laid down in the 1916 Proclamation and stated that as workers we do not need inspiration form Russia, Spain or Mexico'''.The Irish Labour Party would recognise the right to private ownership, freedom of the press and religious liberty, the resolution concluded. The term 'Workers Republic' in the constitution was said to be problematic. It was seen by members of society and the Labour Party to be pro-Soviet. The INTO in particular were influential, both nationally and in Cork, in opposing the use of the term. They believe it went beyond Catholic social teaching and when the term was referred to the Bishops for their view, it signalled the triumph of Catholicism. The onslaught of the Church, Catholic lay speakers, the press and other political parties was too much and the Catholic ethos in the party was very strong. The right to private property and the belief that Labour was a party of public ownership had also been opposed and cost the Party support that went to Fianna Fail.\n\nThe civil and political antagonism to Labour and the threat of socialism/communism was expressed at a lecture of Corporate State by Professor Hogan of UCC I May 1934. Attended by William T. Cosgrave and many in CnaG/ FG party, the lecture was entitled 'Corporate State \u2013 An Alternative to Capitalism and Socialism'. Hogan deemed socialism to be a threat and the state needed an alternative which the corporate state provides, based on Christian social teaching and the removal of the issue of class politics. Socialists, he argued, sought class conflict and Irish trade unionists deny that they are Marxists, yet subscribe to the class war idea. However, Christian trade unions in Holland and Belgium were working the principles contained in the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum', where capital and labour come together and co-operate successfully, he concluded.\n\nThe press offered little support, with a Cork Examiner editorial in 1947 dismissing the Labour view that capitalism was not working and that free enterprise was being replaced by monopolies. The editorial argued that communism would not deliver utopia, that the right to property was sacrosanct and that free enterprise and not state controls or monopolies was the way forward. The Labour Party fear as being seen as supporting communism or indeed being infiltrated by communists is seen in how Labour reacted to a new branch of the Party in the City.\n\n==== The Liam Mellows Branch ====\nFrom 1935, the Party organisation had endeavoured to establish a number of branches around the city. Blarney Street was one of the areas identified by the Organisation Committee but it was not until 1943 on the initiative of Michael O'Riordan that a branch was formed there in February. A number of men involved in the Connolly Group in the Curragh joined him. The branch was named in honour of [[Liam Mellows]]. Naming a branch after someone such as Mellows was unusual for the party and the suspicion of communist influence may have been a factor in the branch being viewed with mistrust. The new branch set up meeting rooms in 16 North Main Street and in November 1943 held their inaugural meeting with then Lord Mayor, [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]], opening the meeting. Quill was elected as Chair, Bill Nagle as vice-chair, Michael O'Riordan as secretary, Minutes Secretary Jim Savage (whom was also a delegate to the Constituency Council) and Marie Keohane as Treasurer. A committee comprising Mrs J Hurley, Ellen Crowley B.A, Derry Kelleher, Jim Savage, Vincent Crotty, Tommy Murray (father of Labour Lord Mayor John Murray) and D.Sheehan elected. The initial report seems to show that Seamus Ronayne was elected as Treasurer but Keohane appears to have acted as branch Treasurer. The Press Release issued after the first meeting stated that 40 members enrolled, that an Organising Committee set out proposed activities and its attitude to the Irish language. The title 'Craobh' rather than 'Branch' was used. Such use of the language was unusual for a Labour Party branch.\n\nThe Branch took out short advertisements for a series of public lectures, describing themselves in those as Craobh Mhaoillosa (Labour Party). The branch became active locally organising public lectures engaged with the trade unions not affiliated with the party and would send delegations to meetings of the Corporation raising issues such as housing. Many of these activities were standard for other Labour branches at the time but the Blarney Street branch appears to have been more energetic and organised in its activities. Branch established a reputation as a dynamic branch and its rapid development appears to all much to all religions organised organisational skills. The branch set up premises in 75 North Main Street premises on the site of the old Boiler Makers' Trade Union and organised a series of public lectures held in the North Main Street premises. Some of the lectures included branch members presenting talks on Liam Mellows, 'The Indian Question', 'Science and Socialism', the Irish language, 'England and the Irish Question', social security and 'The Jewish Question'.\n\n===== O'Riordan accuses Quill of Anti-Semitism =====\nO'Riordan asserts that Quill was imposed on the Liam Mellows Branch as Chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also argued that the talk on the Jewish question arose following comments made by Timothy Quill on ''<nowiki/>'Jew Boys'''. [[Gerald Goldberg]] was present at the talk and was so impressed by O'Riordan that he subsequently donated \u00a35 to the branch. Quill, perhaps irritated by the talk demanded that the money be returned. \n\n===== 2001 Labour Party Conference =====\nO'Riordan, in a speech to the 2001 Labour Party Conference, stated that ''\"I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the party' with Jewish money. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled by the party.\"''<blockquote>''\"Following my release from the Curragh Camp and my return to Cork in 1943, I was among those who founded the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party in the hope that it might become the political voice of Irish anti-fascism in this city. I was named secretary of that branch but unfortunately the chairman we were given by the Party leadership was a Cork City Councillor who would debase the name of Labour in 1944 by a vitriolic attack on what he called \"the Jew boys\" of Cork. It was in opposition to such anti-Semitism that I insisted on giving a public lecture under the auspices of the Liam Mellows Branch on the subject of the Jewish question. A number of prominent members of Cork's Jewish community attended that public meeting and the future Lord Mayor of Cork, Gerald Goldberg, said from the floor: \"I came here to defend my people, but when I heard the lecturer I saw there was no need\". But the anti-Semitic Labour Councillor did not give up. When Gerald Goldberg subsequently made a donation to branch funds I was accused of attempting to 'subvert the Party with Jewish money'. An investigating committee was established, presided over by a Labour TD. The complaint against me was sustained and I was expelled from a Party that was not prepared to support my continuing anti-fascist stand in 1944.\"''</blockquote>While there is merit to this claim, it does appear to be more complex than this account. Antisemitism did exist in the city at this time and Quill was a devout Catholic. Barry Desmond in his book ''<nowiki/>'No Workers Republic''' testifies to the antisemitic feeling in the city at the time. There was a strong anti-communist sentiment within Labour and the party had been constantly assailed in the city by professor Alfred O'Rahilly and many figures within the Roman Church, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. The Communist Party in Eire had been disbanded but the NI party still existed. O'Riordan and Nagle attended the NI Communist Party conference in Belfast in October 1943 with four Labour members (including John De Courcey Ireland).\n\nA report in [[The Irish Press|''The'' ''Irish Press'']] suggests that the Administrative Council ''<nowiki/>'had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch'''. This was headed up by vice-chair, TJ Murphy. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. O'Riordan maintained that he had only attended to meet former comrades socially. Following an investigation, the committee recommended the expulsion of both and the decision was approved of by the Parliamentary Party. The two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the 4 Dublin members in April. Both decisions were ratified by the annual conference that year. But there are no reports or minutes of O'Riordan being expelled by the party locally on the Jewish episode but it is likely that it played a role in the expulsions. Likewise, it is clear that Timothy Quill, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views as possibly anti-Semitic views. The perceived threat of Soviet communism was perhaps the reason that Timothy Quill was nominated as Chair of the Liam Mellows Branch. It was around this time that the IT&GWU disaffiliated from Labour and the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]] and separate Trade Union Congress on the basis that Soviets were infiltrating the Labour Party.\n\n===== Labour vs National Labour =====\nOne incident involving the branch illustrates the divisions within the party in the city. ''The Cork Examiner'' reported in August 1944 that a deputation of three members of the Liam Mellows Branch spoke at a meeting Cork Corporation on the issue of juvenile offenders in the city. They requested a commission to review the issue and that a system of 'constructive reformation' rather than prison punishment take place. After the deputation left the meeting, PJ O'Brien of the National Labour Party launched an attack on the delegation stating that these were members of the Labour Party who sought to introduce 'neo communism' into Cork. Quill, Leader of the Labour Party group in the Corporation angrily objected stating that it was false. The meeting agreed to defer the report to the next meeting. At that meeting on 12 September 1944, the report was adopted.\n\n===== Dissolution of Liam Mellow Branch =====\nFollowing the expulsion of O'Riordan, the Branch was dissolved and the members of the branch transferred to the Central Branch. The Branch voted for the party to reinstate both members, however, this was refused nationally.<ref>'The Liam Mellows Branch by Irish Historian Eamonn Kirwan'</ref><ref>'Timothy Quill (1901-1960) by Irish Historian Eamonn Kirwan'</ref><ref>'Michael O'Riordan by Irish Historian Eamonn Kirwan'</ref>\n", "name_user": "Newcastle1977", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Mellows_Branch"}
