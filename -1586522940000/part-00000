[[Netherlands|Dutch]]-occupied colonies in the area were known for about 300 years as the [[Dutch East Indies]] before [[Indonesian independence]]. The East Indies may also include the former [[French Indochina]], former British territories [[Brunei]] and [[Singapore]] and former [[Portuguese Timor]]. It does not, however, include the former [[Netherlands New Guinea]], which is geographically considered to be part of [[Melanesia]].\n\nThe inhabitants of the East Indies are almost never called ''East Indians'', distinguishing them both from inhabitants of the [[Caribbean]] (which is also called the [[West Indies]]) and from the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] who are often called ''[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]''. In colonial times they were just \"natives\". However, the peoples of the East Indies comprise a wide variety of cultural diversity, and the inhabitants do not consider themselves as belonging to a single [[ethnic]] group. [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] are the most popular [[Major religious groups|religions]] throughout the region, while [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Chinese folk religion]] and various other traditional beliefs and practices are also prominent in some areas. The major languages in this area draw from a wide variety of [[language families]], and should not be confused with the term [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], a group of languages spoken in the [[Indian subcontinent]].\n\nThe extensive East Indies are subdivided into two sections (from a European perspective), archaically called Hither India and [[Farther India|Further India]]. The first is the former [[British India]], the second is [[Southeast Asia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nRegions of the East Indies are sometimes known by the colonial empire they once belonged to, hence, ''British East Indies'' refers to [[Malaysia]], ''Dutch East Indies'' means [[Indonesia]], and ''Spanish East Indies'' means the [[Philippines]].\n\nHistorically, the king of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] (modern [[Ethiopia]]) was identified with \"[[Prester John]] of the Indies\", since that part of the world was imagined to be one of \"Three Indias\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Rivier Kali Besar in de benedenstad van Djakarta West Java TMnr 10014936.jpg|left|thumb|[[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Dutch East Indies]].]]\n\nExploration of these regions by [[Europe]]an powers first began in the late 15th century and early 16th century led by the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorers]].<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4397/ |title = The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1778 |accessdate = 2013-08-30 }}</ref>  The Portuguese described the entire region they discovered as the ''Indies''. Eventually, the region would be broken up into a series of ''Indies'': The East Indies, which was also called \"Old Indies\" or \"Great Indies\", consisting of [[India]], and the West Indies, also called \"New Indies\" or \"Little Indies\", consisting of the [[Americas]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R.

[[Netherlands|Dutch]]-occupied colonies in the area were known for about 300 years as the [[Dutch East Indies]] before [[Indonesian independence]]. The East Indies may also include the former [[French Indochina]], former British territories [[Brunei]] and [[Singapore]] and former [[Portuguese Timor]].

In colonial times they were just \"natives\". However, the peoples of the East Indies comprise a wide variety of cultural diversity, and the inhabitants do not consider themselves as belonging to a single [[ethnic]] group. [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] are the most popular [[Major religious groups|religions]] throughout the region, while [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Chinese folk religion]] and various other traditional beliefs and practices are also prominent in some areas. The major languages in this area draw from a wide variety of [[language families]], and should not be confused with the term [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]], a group of languages spoken in the [[Indian subcontinent]].\n\nThe extensive East Indies are subdivided into two sections (from a European perspective), archaically called Hither India and [[Farther India|Further India]]. The first is the former [[British India]], the second is [[Southeast Asia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nRegions of the East Indies are sometimes known by the colonial empire they once belonged to, hence, ''British East Indies'' refers to [[Malaysia]], ''Dutch East Indies'' means [[Indonesia]], and ''Spanish East Indies'' means the [[Philippines]].\n\nHistorically, the king of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] (modern [[Ethiopia]]) was identified with \"[[Prester John]] of the Indies\", since that part of the world was imagined to be one of \"Three Indias\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Rivier Kali Besar in de benedenstad van Djakarta West Java TMnr 10014936.jpg|left|thumb|[[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Dutch East Indies]].]]\n\nExploration of these regions by [[Europe]]an powers first began in the late 15th century and early 16th century led by the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorers]].<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4397/ |title = The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1778 |accessdate = 2013-08-30 }}</ref>  The Portuguese described the entire region they discovered as the ''Indies''.

A proven ability to be at the business end of the National ensured plenty of public support to be sent off at 15/2. In addition, he was to be partnered, as last year, by Chris Grant, jointly the most experienced rider in the race, weighing out for his ninth National. The pair ran what was considered at the time by many in racing to be a textbook Grand National: hunting around the first circuit in mid-division before gradually moving through the field on the second; always in touch, they moved into the rear of a leading group of seven at the Canal Turn on the second circuit, tracking the group until moving up onto the tail of the leader over the final two fences. When asked to quicken however, Grant found his mount to be a spent force and instead of closing on the leader he was swallowed up by other stronger finishers, coming home in fifth place.<ref name=\"grand-national\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grand-national.me.uk/3731/1989grandnationalraceresults/|title=1989 Grand National Results|publisher=grand-national.me.uk|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> The pair would return in 1990 for a third attempt at the race together.\n\n'''Bonanza Boy''' had won the [[Welsh Grand National]] at [[Chepstow]] four months earlier<ref>{{cite web|author =espmadrid |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adIKlv-z3JY |title=1988 Coral Welsh National Handicap Chase |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> before going on to win the [[Racing Post Chase]] in even more impressive style.<ref>{{cite web|author =espmadrid |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe7k7uTg8mk |title=1989 Racing Post Handicap Chase |publisher=YouTube |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> These two victorious performances on ground getting close to the conditions at Aintree in the week leading up to the National led the public to discount a modest performance in the recent [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]]<ref>{{cite web|author =Sinno12ify's channel |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsau32l_vYI |title=Desert Orchid 1989 Gold Cup \u2013 FULL RACE CLIP |publisher=YouTube |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> and back him to win at 10/1.

That race had been won by Simon Sherwood aboard [[Desert Orchid]] but with the Cheltenham Champion not sent to Aintree, Sherwood took the ride on The Thinker in a bid to complete the double in the same season. Despite being given the top weight of 11&nbsp;stone 10&nbsp;lbs, The Thinker was backed down to 10/1 at the off but for most of the race it looked as if they would fare no better than to complete the course. At the Canal Turn on the second circuit they were a good ten lengths adrift of the leading group of eight and seemed only to be making modest headway as they crossed the Anchor Bridge crossing. On the run to the second last flight however the top weight made relentless progress to not only catch the group ahead of him but start to work through them, taking the penultimate flight in fourth place, albeit crashing through the fence and nearly falling. Sherwood was able to gather The Thinker up and took the final flight in third place, quickly reeling in Durham Edition to move into second place but at the elbow their challenge began to falter and they passed the post a length down on the runner up in third. The Thinker was yet again burdened with top weight for the 1990 Grand National only to be withdrawn on the eve of the race. Worse was to follow in 1991, when the horse was backed down to 16/1, despite being thirteen years old. In company with Chris Grant he was cantering at Aintree on the Thursday before the race when he shattered a leg and had to be destroyed.<ref>''Daily Express'' Page 36, Friday 6 April 1991</ref>\n\n[[West Tip]] was by now a people's champion after following up his [[1986 Grand National]] victory with fourth-placed finishes in [[1987 Grand National|1987]] and [[1988 Grand National|1988]] after falling at his first attempt in [[1985 Grand National|1985]]. As in all his previous Nationals he was partnered by [[Richard Dunwoody]]. West Tip went into the front rank right from the off and led the field over the Chair at the half way stage. They were headed by the eventual winner on the way down to Becher's Brook for the second time and looked to a beaten horse, dropping back to fifth as the leaders turned for the second last fence. Dunwoody was able to find a second wind from the former National winner jumping the final fence as they moved into second place before being outpaced by the eventual winner.\n\nOthers widely supported on the day were 1986 Welsh National winner, '''Stearsby''' at 14/1, '''Lastofthebrownies''' and '''Perris Valley''' at 16/1, the latter of which provided Brendan Sheridan with the best fancied ride of the sixteen jockeys making their debut in the race. Former National winner Neale Doughty took the mount on '''Gala's Image''' which started at 18/1 with the 1988 Lord Mildmay of Fleet winner, '''Smart Tar'''. Last year's third placed '''Monanore''' was considered an excellent each-way chance at 20/1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/National+regular+Monanore+is+put+down+at+25.-a084702205 |title=National regular Monanore is put down at 25. \u2013 Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> while fifth placed '''Attitude Adjuster''' started at the longer odds of 25/1 with '''Bob Tisdall''' and '''Gainsay''', the latter of which being owned by [[Errol Brown]], better known as the lead singer of the popular 1970s and 1980s pop group, [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]].

Jimmy Frost took the mount as his debut ride in the race with many newspaper tipsters suggesting that the pair would part company during the race. Frost kept Little Polveir among the leading dozen on the first circuit, moving up to take the lead as the field jumped the water at the end of the first circuit. They were never again headed and after the fall of Smart Tar at the twenty-first fence, maintained a lead of at least three lengths for the rest of the race.\n\n==Finishing order==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|'''Position'''\n|'''Name'''\n|'''[[Jockey]]'''\n|'''Age'''\n|'''Weight'''\n|'''[[Starting price|SP]]'''\n|'''Distance'''\n|-\n|1st\n|[[Little Polveir]]\n|Jimmy Frost\n|12\n|10-03\n|28/1\n|Won by 7 lengths\n|-\n|2nd\n|[[West Tip]]\n|[[Richard Dunwoody]]\n|12\n|10\u201311\n|12/1\n|\u00bd length\n|-\n|3rd\n|[[The Thinker (horse)|The Thinker]]\n|Simon Sherwood\n|11\n|11\u201310\n|10/1\n|6 lengths\n|-\n|4th\n|Lastofthebrownies\n|Tommy Carmody\n|9\n|10-00\n|16/1\n|5 lengths\n|-\n|5th\n|Durham Edition\n|Chris Grant\n|11\n|10\u201311\n|15/2\n|8 lengths\n|-\n|6th\n|Monanore\n|Graham McCourt\n|12\n|10-06\n|20/1\n|2\u00bd lengths\n|-\n|7th\n|Gala's Image\n|Neale Doughty\n|9\n|10-03\n|18/1\n|1\u00bd lengths\n|-\n|8th\n|Bonanza Boy\n|[[Peter Scudamore]]\n|8\n|11-01\n|10/1\n|4 lengths\n|-\n|9th\n|Team Challenge\n|Michael Bowlby\n|7\n|10-00\n|30/1\n|15 lengths\n|-\n|10th\n|Newnham\n|Mr. Simon Andrews\n|12\n|10-05\n|50/1\n|25 lengths\n|-\n|11th\n|The Thirsty Farmer\n|Lars Kelp\n|10\n|10-02\n|100/1\n|\n|-\n|12th\n|Attitude Adjuster\n|Niall Madden\n|9\n|10-06\n|25/1\n|\n|-\n|13th\n|Sidbury Hill\n|Kevin Mooney\n|13\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|\n|-\n|14th\n|Mr. Baker\n|Michael Moran\n|11\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|Last to complete\n|}\n<ref>Chris Simpson \u2013 Grand Nationals of the 80s booklet</ref>\n\n==Non-finishers==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|'''Fence'''\n|'''Name'''\n|'''[[Jockey]]'''\n|'''Age'''\n|'''Weight'''\n|'''[[Starting price|SP]]'''\n|'''Fate'''\n|-\n|1st\n|Cerimau\n|Peter Hobbs\n|11\n|10-00\n|80/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|2nd\n|Cranlome\n|Kevin O'Brien\n|11\n|10-00\n|66/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|2nd\n|Bob Tisdall\n|John White\n|10\n|10-07\n|25/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Hettinger\n|Ray Goldstein\n|9\n|10-00\n|300/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Sir Jest\n|Mickey Hammond\n|11\n|10-01\n|40/1\n|Brought down\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Dixton House\n|Tom Morgan\n|10\n|10-03\n|7/1 F\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Sergeant Sprite\n|Tom Taaffe\n|9\n|10-02\n|50/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Brown Trix\n|Mr. David Pitcher\n|11\n|10-05\n|300/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Seeandem\n|Liam Cusack\n|9\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|11th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Friendly Henry\n|[[Hywel Davies (jockey)|Hywel Davies]]\n|9\n|10-04\n|66/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|11th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Perris Valley\n|Brendan Sheridan\n|8\n|10-00\n|16/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|11th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Stearsby\n|Brendan Powell\n|10\n|10-09\n|14/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|15th <small>([[The Chair (Aintree Racecourse)|The Chair]])</small>\n|Smartside\n|Mr. Al Hambly\n|14\n|10-05\n|300/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|16th <small>(Water Jump)</small>\n|Mr. Chris\n|Brian Storey\n|10\n|10-00\n|200/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|18th\n|Beamwam\n|Mr. David Naylor-Leyland\n|11\n|10-06\n|100/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|19th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Gainsay\n|Mark Pitman\n|10\n|10-06\n|25/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|19th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Queensway Boy\n|Alan Webb\n|10\n|10-00\n|50/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|20th\n|Smart Tar\n|[[Carl Llewellyn]]\n|8\n|10-03\n|18/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|21st\n|Mearlin\n|Simon McNeill\n|10\n|10-00\n|300/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|21st\n|Numerate\n|Tarnya Davis\n|10\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|25th <small>(Valentine's)</small>\n|Polar Nomad\n|Alan Merrigan\n|8\n|10-00\n|80/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|25th <small>(Valentine's)</small>\n|Bartres\n|Graham Bradley\n|10\n|10-03\n|33/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|27th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Kersil\n|Andrew Orkney\n|12\n|10-00\n|300/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|28th\n|Rausal\n|Dai Tegg\n|10\n|10-00\n|50/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|28th\n|Memberson\n|Guy Upton\n|11\n|10-02\n|33/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|28th\n|Mithras\n|Robert Stronge\n|11\n|10-01\n|66/1\n|Pulled up\n|}\n<ref>Chris Simpson \u2013 Grand Nationals of the 80s Booklet</ref><ref name=\"freewebs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/grandnationalanorak/wheretheyfell.htm|title=Grand National Anorak|publisher=freewebs.com|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Media coverage and aftermath==\nThe BBC broadcast the race live on television for the thirtieth consecutive year as part of its regular Saturday afternoon [[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]] programme, in a Grand National special. [[Des Lynam]] was the anchor presenter. Former Grand National jockeys, [[Richard Pitman]] and Bill Smith provided background and build up to all the races on the card including the National. The television commentary team was unchanged for the eighteenth consecutive year in John Hanmer, [[Julian Wilson (commentator)|Julian Wilson]] and lead commentator, [[Peter O'Sullevan]] who was calling his forty-fourth Grand National.<ref name=\"freewebs2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/grandnationalanorak/thebbc.htm|title=Grand National Anorak|publisher=freewebs.com|accessdate=27 August 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HWG9Tsqf?url=http://www.freewebs.com/grandnationalanorak/thebbc.htm|archive-date=20 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe BBC, and in particular Julian Wilson and Richard Pitman came in for heavy criticism from the general public for their handling of an incident at Becher's Brook on the first circuit which left two horses having to be [[animal euthanasia|euthanised]]. Seeandem, ridden by Liam Cusack, broke his back in a horrific fall at the fence<ref>[http://img.pars04.fr.topfoto.co.uk/imageflows/preview/t=topfoto&f=STH055856 Image of the vet euthanising Seeandem, concealed from the crowd by a green tarpaulin which was then used to cover the body which was broadcast on the second circuit]</ref> while Brown Trix, ridden by amateur jockey David Pitcher, fell into the water-filled brook, fracturing a shoulder, and being saved from drowning by his rider jumping into the brook to support his head until he could be freed.\n\nBy the time the remaining runners reached the fence on the second circuit, course officials had not yet been able to remove Seeandem's body, while Brown Trix still lay in a distressed state by the fence, which had been partly dolled off, meaning television viewers clearly saw the [[tarpaulin]] covering Seeandem's body by the inside edge of the fence, and Brown Trix laying mortally injured on the outside. These images were shown again in the post-race analysis, and during the race, commentator [[Julian Wilson (commentator)|Julian Wilson]] compounded the incident by pointing out to viewers that the runners had to avoid \"a dead horse\", and in the post-race analysis [[Richard Pitman]] had said Brown Trix had \"got up after a short rest, only winded\".\n\nWhile the comments of the two commentators caused many complaints among viewers, it was the BBC's decision to show the incident again in slow motion in the post race review, covered by Pitman and Smith, which created the bigger outcry. In addition, when the BBC screened its Scheduled late evening highlights programme, they received further criticism for showing the race in full and not editing out the field jumping Becher's Brook on both circuits with Wilson's original commentary omitted from the highlights footage.\n\nFollowing an outcry, and further to criticisms following Dark Ivy's fatal fall in the [[1987 Grand National]], a question of the future safety of the race was raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\nIn response Aintree made several changes to Becher's, including levelling-off the slope on the landing side and raising the brook itself to contain only one inch of water. Security on the course was also tightened after another incident in the later stages of the race where a group of intoxicated youths ran onto the course and were seen to be playing [[Chicken (game)|chicken]] with the runners as they turned towards the second last fence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/alt2/grandnational12/thehistory.htm |title=The History |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nFurther criticisms were raised by some of the riders in the race itself that amateur rider David Pitcher had been allowed to take part at all. Pitcher, who had only a few years riding experience, had set off in an alarming manner on board his mount Brown Trix, diving the horse alarmingly at the third fence in particular. The criticism was heightened by the fact that Brown Trix was one of the two horses to suffer fatal falls. On viewing a playback of the race, champion jockey Peter Scudamore was scathing in his criticism when he stated ''\"I like David Pitcher. He's a nice man and as a person I've got a lot of time for him. But, in my view, he had no right to ride in the Grand National.... He's a bad tactician and, as far as I could see, he had no race plans. He just rode like a maniac down over those first three or four fences and, to me, that's not fearless. It's brainless. He rides a horse like he's swinging from the heels against West Indian fast-bowling.\"''<ref>221: Peter Scudamore's Record Season 1989 by Dudley Doust, 1989 {{ISBN|978-0340508886}}</ref> Pitcher did not help his cause by stating ''\"What could the best jockey in the world do about his horse falling back into the ditch? In National Hunt racing, you learn to live with dead horses.\"''\n\nAintree responded by bringing in tighter qualifying regulations for amateur riders for the following year. Pitcher himself had to be treated in hospital for biting through his tongue and bottom lip in his fall, while Ray Goldstein was also taken to hospital after being left unconscious and suffering concussion, having been one of four other riders to fall at Becher's Brook on the first circuit.<ref>Daily Express page 14 Monday 10 April 1989</ref>\n\nLittle Polveir ran just four more times over fences, being beaten twice by Bonanza Boy, including the 1989 Welsh Grand National.

In addition, he was to be partnered, as last year, by Chris Grant, jointly the most experienced rider in the race, weighing out for his ninth National. The pair ran what was considered at the time by many in racing to be a textbook Grand National: hunting around the first circuit in mid-division before gradually moving through the field on the second; always in touch, they moved into the rear of a leading group of seven at the Canal Turn on the second circuit, tracking the group until moving up onto the tail of the leader over the final two fences.

That race had been won by Simon Sherwood aboard [[Desert Orchid]] but with the Cheltenham Champion not sent to Aintree, Sherwood took the ride on The Thinker in a bid to complete the double in the same season. Despite being given the top weight of 11&nbsp;stone 10&nbsp;lbs, The Thinker was backed down to 10/1 at the off but for most of the race it looked as if they would fare no better than to complete the course. At the Canal Turn on the second circuit they were a good ten lengths adrift of the leading group of eight and seemed only to be making modest headway as they crossed the Anchor Bridge crossing. On the run to the second last flight however the top weight made relentless progress to not only catch the group ahead of him but start to work though them, taking the penultimate flight in fourth place, albeit crashing through the fence and nearly falling. Sherwood was able to gather The Thinker up and took the final flight in third place, quickly reeling in Durham Edition to move into second place but at the elbow their challenge began to falter and they passed the post a length down on the runner up in third. The Thinker was yet again burdened with top weight for the 1990 Grand National only to be withdrawn on the eve of the race. Worse was to follow in 1991, when the horse was backed down to 16/1, despite being thirteen years old. In company with Chris Grant he was cantering at Aintree on the Thursday before the race when he shattered a leg and had to be destroyed.<ref>''Daily Express'' Page 36, Friday 6 April 1991</ref>\n\n[[West Tip]] was by now a people's champion after following up his [[1986 Grand National]] victory with fourth-placed finishes in [[1987 Grand National|1987]] and [[1988 Grand National|1988]] after falling at his first attempt in [[1985 Grand National|1985]]. As in all his previous Nationals he was partnered by [[Richard Dunwoody]]. West Tip went into the front rank right from the off and led the field over the Chair at the half way stage. They were headed by the eventual winner on the way down to Becher's Brook for the second time and looked to a beaten horse, dropping back to fifth as the leaders turned for the second last fence. Dunwoody was able to find a second wind from the former National winner jumping the final fence as they moved into second place before being outpaced by the eventual winner.\n\nOthers widely supported on the day were 1986 Welsh National winner, '''Stearsby''' at 14/1, '''Lastofthebrownies''' and '''Perris Valley''' at 16/1, the latter of which provided Brendan Sheridan with the best fancied ride of the sixteen jockeys making their debut in the race. Former National winner Neale Doughty took the mount on '''Gala's Image''' which started at 18/1 with the 1988 Lord Mildmay of Fleet winner, '''Smart Tar'''. Last year's third placed '''Monanore''' was considered an excellent each-way chance at 20/1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/National+regular+Monanore+is+put+down+at+25.-a084702205 |title=National regular Monanore is put down at 25. \u2013 Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> while fifth placed '''Attitude Adjuster''' started at the longer odds of 25/1 with '''Bob Tisdall''' and '''Gainsay''', the latter of which being owned by [[Errol Brown]], better known as the lead singer of the popular 1970s and 1980s pop group, [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]]. [[Little Polveir]] was allowed to go off at the modest odds of 28/1, despite having won the [[Scottish Grand National]] in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|author =espmadrid |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_DHfvDT7Yk |title=1987 William Hill Scottish National Handicap Chase |publisher=YouTube |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> This would be the horse's fourth, and surely final attempt at a race he had completed in tenth place in 1987 before falling in each of the last two Nationals, the latter of which had seen him leading when unseating his rider five fences from the finish. Jimmy Frost took the mount as his debut ride in the race with many newspaper tipsters suggesting that the pair would part company during the race. Frost kept Little Polveir among the leading dozen on the first circuit, moving up to take the lead as the field jumped the water at the end of the first circuit. They were never again headed and after the fall of Smart Tar at the twenty-first fence, maintained a lead of at least three lengths for the rest of the race.\n\n==Finishing order==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|'''Position'''\n|'''Name'''\n|'''[[Jockey]]'''\n|'''Age'''\n|'''Weight'''\n|'''[[Starting price|SP]]'''\n|'''Distance'''\n|-\n|1st\n|[[Little Polveir]]\n|Jimmy Frost\n|12\n|10-03\n|28/1\n|Won by 7 lengths\n|-\n|2nd\n|[[West Tip]]\n|[[Richard Dunwoody]]\n|12\n|10\u201311\n|12/1\n|\u00bd length\n|-\n|3rd\n|[[The Thinker (horse)|The Thinker]]\n|Simon Sherwood\n|11\n|11\u201310\n|10/1\n|6 lengths\n|-\n|4th\n|Lastofthebrownies\n|Tommy Carmody\n|9\n|10-00\n|16/1\n|5 lengths\n|-\n|5th\n|Durham Edition\n|Chris Grant\n|11\n|10\u201311\n|15/2\n|8 lengths\n|-\n|6th\n|Monanore\n|Graham McCourt\n|12\n|10-06\n|20/1\n|2\u00bd lengths\n|-\n|7th\n|Gala's Image\n|Neale Doughty\n|9\n|10-03\n|18/1\n|1\u00bd lengths\n|-\n|8th\n|Bonanza Boy\n|[[Peter Scudamore]]\n|8\n|11-01\n|10/1\n|4 lengths\n|-\n|9th\n|Team Challenge\n|Michael Bowlby\n|7\n|10-00\n|30/1\n|15 lengths\n|-\n|10th\n|Newnham\n|Mr. Simon Andrews\n|12\n|10-05\n|50/1\n|25 lengths\n|-\n|11th\n|The Thirsty Farmer\n|Lars Kelp\n|10\n|10-02\n|100/1\n|\n|-\n|12th\n|Attitude Adjuster\n|Niall Madden\n|9\n|10-06\n|25/1\n|\n|-\n|13th\n|Sidbury Hill\n|Kevin Mooney\n|13\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|\n|-\n|14th\n|Mr. Baker\n|Michael Moran\n|11\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|Last to complete\n|}\n<ref>Chris Simpson \u2013 Grand Nationals of the 80s booklet</ref>\n\n==Non-finishers==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|'''Fence'''\n|'''Name'''\n|'''[[Jockey]]'''\n|'''Age'''\n|'''Weight'''\n|'''[[Starting price|SP]]'''\n|'''Fate'''\n|-\n|1st\n|Cerimau\n|Peter Hobbs\n|11\n|10-00\n|80/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|2nd\n|Cranlome\n|Kevin O'Brien\n|11\n|10-00\n|66/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|2nd\n|Bob Tisdall\n|John White\n|10\n|10-07\n|25/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Hettinger\n|Ray Goldstein\n|9\n|10-00\n|300/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Sir Jest\n|Mickey Hammond\n|11\n|10-01\n|40/1\n|Brought down\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Dixton House\n|Tom Morgan\n|10\n|10-03\n|7/1 F\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Sergeant Sprite\n|Tom Taaffe\n|9\n|10-02\n|50/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Brown Trix\n|Mr. David Pitcher\n|11\n|10-05\n|300/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|6th <small>([[Becher's Brook]])</small>\n|Seeandem\n|Liam Cusack\n|9\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|11th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Friendly Henry\n|[[Hywel Davies (jockey)|Hywel Davies]]\n|9\n|10-04\n|66/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|11th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Perris Valley\n|Brendan Sheridan\n|8\n|10-00\n|16/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|11th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Stearsby\n|Brendan Powell\n|10\n|10-09\n|14/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|15th <small>([[The Chair (Aintree Racecourse)|The Chair]])</small>\n|Smartside\n|Mr. Al Hambly\n|14\n|10-05\n|300/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|16th <small>(Water Jump)</small>\n|Mr. Chris\n|Brian Storey\n|10\n|10-00\n|200/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|18th\n|Beamwam\n|Mr. David Naylor-Leyland\n|11\n|10-06\n|100/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|19th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Gainsay\n|Mark Pitman\n|10\n|10-06\n|25/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|19th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Queensway Boy\n|Alan Webb\n|10\n|10-00\n|50/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|20th\n|Smart Tar\n|[[Carl Llewellyn]]\n|8\n|10-03\n|18/1\n|Fell\n|-\n|21st\n|Mearlin\n|Simon McNeill\n|10\n|10-00\n|300/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|21st\n|Numerate\n|Tarnya Davis\n|10\n|10-00\n|100/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|25th <small>(Valentine's)</small>\n|Polar Nomad\n|Alan Merrigan\n|8\n|10-00\n|80/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|25th <small>(Valentine's)</small>\n|Bartres\n|Graham Bradley\n|10\n|10-03\n|33/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|27th <small>(open ditch)</small>\n|Kersil\n|Andrew Orkney\n|12\n|10-00\n|300/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|28th\n|Rausal\n|Dai Tegg\n|10\n|10-00\n|50/1\n|Refused\n|-\n|28th\n|Memberson\n|Guy Upton\n|11\n|10-02\n|33/1\n|Pulled up\n|-\n|28th\n|Mithras\n|Robert Stronge\n|11\n|10-01\n|66/1\n|Pulled up\n|}\n<ref>Chris Simpson \u2013 Grand Nationals of the 80s Booklet</ref><ref name=\"freewebs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/grandnationalanorak/wheretheyfell.htm|title=Grand National Anorak|publisher=freewebs.com|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Media coverage and aftermath==\nThe BBC broadcast the race live on television for the thirtieth consecutive year as part of its regular Saturday afternoon [[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]] programme, in a Grand National special. [[Des Lynam]] was the anchor presenter. Former Grand National jockeys, [[Richard Pitman]] and Bill Smith provided background and build up to all the races on the card including the National. The television commentary team was unchanged for the eighteenth consecutive year in John Hanmer, [[Julian Wilson (commentator)|Julian Wilson]] and lead commentator, [[Peter O'Sullevan]] who was calling his forty-fourth Grand National.<ref name=\"freewebs2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/grandnationalanorak/thebbc.htm|title=Grand National Anorak|publisher=freewebs.com|accessdate=27 August 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HWG9Tsqf?url=http://www.freewebs.com/grandnationalanorak/thebbc.htm|archive-date=20 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe BBC, and in particular Julian Wilson and Richard Pitman came in for heavy criticism from the general public for their handling of an incident at Becher's Brook on the first circuit which left two horses having to be [[animal euthanasia|euthanised]]. Seeandem, ridden by Liam Cusack, broke his back in a horrific fall at the fence<ref>[http://img.pars04.fr.topfoto.co.uk/imageflows/preview/t=topfoto&f=STH055856 Image of the vet euthanising Seeandem, concealed from the crowd by a green tarpaulin which was then used to cover the body which was broadcast on the second circuit]</ref> while Brown Trix, ridden by amateur jockey David Pitcher, fell into the water-filled brook, fracturing a shoulder, and being saved from drowning by his rider jumping into the brook to support his head until he could be freed.\n\nBy the time the remaining runners reached the fence on the second circuit, course officials had not yet been able to remove Seeandem's body, while Brown Trix still lay in a distressed state by the fence, which had been partly dolled off, meaning television viewers clearly saw the [[tarpaulin]] covering Seeandem's body by the inside edge of the fence, and Brown Trix laying mortally injured on the outside. These images were shown again in the post-race analysis, and during the race, commentator [[Julian Wilson (commentator)|Julian Wilson]] compounded the incident by pointing out to viewers that the runners had to avoid \"a dead horse\", and in the post-race analysis [[Richard Pitman]] had said Brown Trix had \"got up after a short rest, only winded\".\n\nWhile the comments of the two commentators caused many complaints among viewers, it was the BBC's decision to show the incident again in slow motion in the post race review, covered by Pitman and Smith, which created the bigger outcry. In addition, when the BBC screened its Scheduled late evening highlights programme, they received further criticism for showing the race in full and not editing out the field jumping Becher's Brook on both circuits with Wilson's original commentary omitted from the highlights footage.\n\nFollowing an outcry, and further to criticisms following Dark Ivy's fatal fall in the [[1987 Grand National]], a question of the future safety of the race was raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\nIn response Aintree made several changes to Becher's, including levelling-off the slope on the landing side and raising the brook itself to contain only one inch of water. Security on the course was also tightened after another incident in the later stages of the race where a group of intoxicated youths ran onto the course and were seen to be playing [[Chicken (game)|chicken]] with the runners as they turned towards the second last fence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/alt2/grandnational12/thehistory.htm |title=The History |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nFurther criticisms were raised by some of the riders in the race itself that amateur rider David Pitcher had been allowed to take part at all. Pitcher, who had only a few years riding experience, had set off in an alarming manner on board his mount Brown Trix, diving the horse alarmingly at the third fence in particular. The criticism was heightened by the fact that Brown Trix was one of the two horses to suffer fatal falls. On viewing a playback of the race, champion jockey Peter Scudamore was scathing in his criticism when he stated ''\"I like David Pitcher. He's a nice man and as a person I've got a lot of time for him. But, in my view, he had no right to ride in the Grand National.... He's a bad tactician and, as far as I could see, he had no race plans. He just rode like a maniac down over those first three or four fences and, to me, that's not fearless. It's brainless. He rides a horse like he's swinging from the heels against West Indian fast-bowling.\"''<ref>221: Peter Scudamore's Record Season 1989 by Dudley Doust, 1989 {{ISBN|978-0340508886}}</ref> Pitcher did not help his cause by stating ''\"What could the best jockey in the world do about his horse falling back into the ditch? In National Hunt racing, you learn to live with dead horses.\"''\n\nAintree responded by bringing in tighter qualifying regulations for amateur riders for the following year. Pitcher himself had to be treated in hospital for biting through his tongue and bottom lip in his fall, while Ray Goldstein was also taken to hospital after being left unconscious and suffering concussion, having been one of four other riders to fall at Becher's Brook on the first circuit.<ref>Daily Express page 14 Monday 10 April 1989</ref>\n\nLittle Polveir ran just four more times over fences, being beaten twice by Bonanza Boy, including the 1989 Welsh Grand National. In his final race in January 1990 he was pulled up and promptly retired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/horse_home.sd?horse_id=5955#topHorseTabs=horse_race_record&bottomHorseTabs=horse_form |title=Little Polveir &#124; Record By Race Type |work=Racing Post|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> Jimmy Frost competed in a further four Grand Nationals without success before retiring from the saddle to become a trainer.

He holds a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Texas, Austin]], and taught for many years prior to that at the [[University of Reading]], [[City University of New York]], and [[Oxford University]].\n\n==Biography==\nStrawson, elder son of Oxford philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]], was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1959\u201365), from where he won a scholarship to [[Winchester College]] (1965\u201368). He left school at 16, after completing his [[A-levels]] and winning a place at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. At Cambridge, he read Oriental Studies (1969\u201371), Social and Political Science (1971\u201372), and Moral Sciences (1972\u201373), before moving to the University of Oxford, where he received his BPhil in philosophy in 1977 and his DPhil in philosophy in 1983. He also spent a year as an ''auditeur libre'' at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris and at the [[Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne]] as a French Government Scholar (1977\u201378).\n\nStrawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1979 to 2000, first as a Stipendiary Lecturer at several different colleges, and then, from 1987 on, as [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and Tutor of [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. In 1993, he was a Visiting Research Fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences, Canberra. He has also taught as a Visiting Professor at [[NYU]] (1997), [[Rutgers University]] (2000), the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (2010) and the [[Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]], Paris (2012). In 2011 he was an Old Dominion Fellow, Council of the Humanities, [[Princeton University]] (2011). In 2000, he moved to the [[University of Reading]] as professor of philosophy, and was also Distinguished Professor of Philosophy from 2004 to 2007 at the [[City University of New York]] Graduate Center. In 2012, he joined the faculty at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] as holder of a new Chair in Philosophy.<ref>[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html \"Leiter, Brian.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829010954/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html |date=29 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Free will==\nIn the [[free will]] debate, Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether [[determinism]] is true or not.  He argues for this position with what he calls his \"basic argument\", which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us.  In its simplest form, the basic argument runs thus:\n\n# You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are.\n# To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are\u2014at least in certain crucial mental respects.\n# But you cannot be ultimately responsible for the way you are in any respect at all.\n# So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.<ref>Strawson, Galen. \"[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 Free Will] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=25 August 2007 }}\" in the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], ed.

He is the son of philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]].  He holds a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Texas, Austin]], and taught for many years prior to that at the [[University of Reading]], [[City University of New York]], and [[Oxford University]].\n\n==Biography==\nStrawson, elder son of Oxford philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]], was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1959\u201365), from where he won a scholarship to [[Winchester College]] (1965\u201368). He left school at 16, after completing his [[A-levels]] and winning a place at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. At Cambridge, he read Oriental Studies (1969\u201371), Social and Political Science (1971\u201372), and Moral Sciences (1972\u201373), before moving to the University of Oxford, where he received his BPhil in philosophy in 1977 and his DPhil in philosophy in 1983. He also spent a year as an ''auditeur libre'' at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris and at the [[Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne]] as a French Government Scholar (1977\u201378).\n\nStrawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1979 to 2000, first as a Stipendiary Lecturer at several different colleges, and then, from 1987 on, as [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and Tutor of [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. In 1993, he was a Visiting Research Fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences, Canberra. He has also taught as a Visiting Professor at [[NYU]] (1997), [[Rutgers University]] (2000), the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (2010) and the [[Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]], Paris (2012). In 2011 he was an Old Dominion Fellow, Council of the Humanities, [[Princeton University]] (2011). In 2000, he moved to the [[University of Reading]] as professor of philosophy, and was also Distinguished Professor of Philosophy from 2004 to 2007 at the [[City University of New York]] Graduate Center. In 2012, he joined the faculty at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] as holder of a new Chair in Philosophy.<ref>[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html \"Leiter, Brian.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829010954/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html |date=29 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Free will==\nIn the [[free will]] debate, Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether [[determinism]] is true or not.  He argues for this position with what he calls his \"basic argument\", which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us.  In its simplest form, the basic argument runs thus:\n\n# You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are.\n# To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are\u2014at least in certain crucial mental respects.\n# But you cannot be ultimately responsible for the way you are in any respect at all.\n# So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.<ref>Strawson, Galen. \"[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 Free Will] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=25 August 2007 }}\" in the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], ed.
