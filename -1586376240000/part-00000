Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

These two were amalgamated into a single battalion and then amalgamated with [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]] and the [[Royal Green Jackets]] to form a new five battalion regiment, called [[The Rifles]]. On its formation, the Light Division was abolished.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm The Rifles - March 2006 situation report 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515082627/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm |date=15 May 2006 }}</ref>\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role (2 RIFLES, 3 RIFLES) - 2\n*Mechanised Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Commando (1 RIFLES) - 1\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n\n* The single regular battalion of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] is unamalgamated to \"retain an infantry footprint in Northern Ireland\".\n**Air Assault/Light Role (1 R IRISH) - 1\n* The [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] is unaffected by the restructuring.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel.

Two notable ones depicting the modern British Army have been ''[[Spearhead (TV series)|Spearhead]]'' from the period of the late 1970s, and ''[[Soldier Soldier]]'' from the early to mid-1990s. Both are seen as reasonably accurate depictions of life in the army at those times, and both are centred on a fictional infantry regiment.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training.

This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force.

Founded in 1552 and received its first Royal Charter in 1553, Christ's Hospital follows much of the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] tradition. Since its establishment, Christ's Hospital has been a [[charity school]], with a core aim to offer children from humble backgrounds the chance of a better education.\n\n==Charitable foundation==\n[[File:quad DH.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Christ's Hospital quad towards dining hall. Picture taken from Big School]]\nChrist's Hospital is almost unique for a British independent school in that the majority of the students receive bursaries. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a [[Means test|means-tested]] basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school or their benefactors, so that pupils from all walks of life are able to have private education that would otherwise be beyond the means of their parents.\n\n[[File:CH FntAvQuad.jpg|thumb|left|Westward photo of Quad and Front Avenue. (View from Art School)]]\n\nThe trustees of the foundation are the Council of Almoners, chaired by the Treasurer of Christ's Hospital, who govern the foundation according to a Scheme of Administration granted by the [[Charity Commission]]. The historic Court of Governors survives as a formal institution consisting of over 650 benefactors but its powers have since the 19th century been largely transferred to the smaller Council of Almoners.\n\nIn 2007 Christ's Hospital was formally separated into two related [[Charitable organization|registered charities]]: Christ's Hospital Foundation<ref>{{EW charity|306975|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL FOUNDATION}}</ref> and Christ's Hospital School.<ref>{{EW charity|1120090|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL SCHOOL}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Christ's Hospital, engraved by Toms c.1770..jpg|thumb|Christ's Hospital's buildings in London in 1770]]\n[[File:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|left|thumb|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]]]\nChrist's Hospital was the result of the foundation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and confirmed by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], assisted by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], Bishop of London, and Sir Richard Dobbs, [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Thornbury, Walter. \"Christ's Hospital.\" ''Old and New London'': Volume 2.

The [[Royal Charter]] was granted and signed by its founder, Edward VI, the following year. The first treasurer was [[Richard Grafton]]. The Protestant foundation survived the [[Mary I of England|Marian]] period and in the 1560s it sent its first scholars to Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe school occupied Newgate as its major site for 350 years, but from time to time children were housed in other parts of the country. 32 children perished during the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague of 1665]]. In the following year the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the Hospital, except four cloisters and three wards, but there were no casualties among the children. Around 200 pupils were sent to Islington and Clerkenwell and then to Ware and Hertford.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century the buildings had been rebuilt with the assistance of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], a governor of Christ's Hospital, and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], who designed the Writing School (1696). The church of [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Christ Church, Newgate Street]], designed by Wren, replaced the damaged choir of the former Greyfriars' church and served as a place of worship for the children of Christ's Hospital in the City until the move to Horsham. Through the will of the royal jeweller, [[George Heriot]], it also became the inspiration for the foundation of [[George Heriot's School|George Heriot's Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]], which was the first of the \"Hospital Schools\" to be founded in Scotland.\n\nChrist's Hospital was given its second [[royal charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1673. This specifically created the [[Royal Mathematical School]], the original purpose of which was to train [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[navigation|navigators]] who would serve as naval officers and merchant seafarers. [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to His Majesty's Navy and from 1699 Vice-President of Christ's Hospital, made a considerable contribution to Christ's Hospital. [[Isaac Newton]], [[Jonas Moore]], [[John Flamsteed]], and  [[Edmund Halley]] contributed to plans for the course of study of the new school within the foundation.\n\n[[File:Blue Coat School Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|This early 19th-century picture shows the Great Hall on St. Matthew's Day, 21 September.

The [[Antonio Verrio|Verrio]] painting can be seen along the wall on the right.]]\n\nThe girls of the hospital settled at [[Hertford]] from 1707. The governors had been paying a teacher in Hertford from 1653, and the removal of some children from London following the Great Fire strengthened the link with the town. In 1761, 200 boys under the age of ten along with the boys from Ware were relocated to Hertford. In 1778 the last girls were moved out of London to join the others at Hertford, where the school was rebuilt 1795\u20131798 to provide accommodation for the new numbers.\n\nChrist's Hospital's most famous upper master was [[James Boyer]] who presided from 1778 to 1799 and instructed [[James Leigh Hunt]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\nIn November 1815 the \u201cmost infamous Regency [[flagellant]]\u201d, an MP named [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Sir Eyre Coote,]] entered Christ's Hospital mathematical school, sent away the younger boys and paid the older ones for a session of mutual flogging.

As a result of this a greater number of girls were admitted. However, in the 1890s boys still outnumbered girls at Hertford.\n\nAnother commission in 1877 proposed a new site for the school, where all the boys would be taught. This proposal  was questioned by some of the Governors. The Duke of Cambridge said \"I am one of those who are perfectly prepared to go with the spirit of the age in which we live, but I confess that I am also one of those who do not love change for change\u2019s sake. To upset an old and long standing institution... is a very dangerous experiment to try.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal was carried out. {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of land outside Horsham in Sussex was purchased from the Aylesbury Dairy Company for \u00a347,500. The foundation stone was laid by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] on 23 October 1897, on behalf of the Sovereign, the date being the anniversary of the birthday of the founder. Architectural features from the old school buildings (the Grecians' Arch and the Wren Arch) were salvaged and incorporated in the new buildings.\n\nThe boys were relocated from Newgate and Hertford to the new site in 1902. Hertford became a girls-only school.\n\nOver the centuries Christ's Hospital has continued to enjoy royal patronage. In 1919, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] became the first Royal Patron, followed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1937 and HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] in 1953.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Constant Lambert as a Blue coat boy.jpg|thumb|The composer [[Constant Lambert]] as a pupil, wearing the traditional uniform]]\nLinks with the City and the [[Lord Mayor of London]] are well maintained, with an annual parade through the City of London on [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew's Day]] and a regular place in the [[Lord Mayor's Show]].\n\nOne of the Christ's Hospital traditions is marching into lunch with the band, which is done each day except Sunday, weather permitting.\n\nAnother is the annual speech-day parade, where the Lord Mayor of London and his procession watch the school perform a march-past through the main quad. They also join the school in chapel for a grand service, and eat lunch with the Grecian year and their parents. Lastly they move to Big School to hear the Senior Grecian's oration and witness the Grecian prize-giving. This is held on the Saturday at the start of the Summer Half Term.\n\n===Uniform===\nThe school's  Tudor [[school uniform|uniform]] consists of belted, long blue coats, knee-breeches, yellow socks, and [[bands (neckwear)|bands]] at the neck.

This consists of a knee-length pleated skirt, summer jacket, yellow socks (for the boys and junior girls), and grey socks or grey/black tights for senior girls, as well as the long coat in winter, and the bands.\n\nIn 2011 students and alumni stated that they saw the uniform as an important way of giving the school a unique identity and unifying the school. Around that time the administrators had discussed the idea of updating the uniform. Over 95% of students voted in favour of keeping the original uniform.<ref name=\"Unifvote\">\"Students Vote to Keep Tudor Uniform.\" British Heritage 32, no. 2 (May 2011): 10.

Famous alumni of Christ's Hospital Music School include conductors Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Charles Hazlewood]], [[Adrian Bawtree]], and Simon Joly, trumpeter [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]] (formerly Principal Trumpet of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), composer [[Tim Benjamin]], and composer and conductor [[Constant Lambert]].\n\nThe school's chapel has a large five-manual [[Rushworth and Dreaper]] organ, one of four organs in the School (the others being a 3-manual 1829 Hill in Big School, played on by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and [[Karg-Elert]], a 2-manual [[Henry Willis & Sons|Father Willis]] in the Dining Hall, and a Flight and Robson chamber organ in the Court Room). The near 150-strong Chapel Choir has made many recordings and through these has earned an excellent reputation.\n\nThroughout the school's history, many musically gifted pupils have gone on to take up choral and organ scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge universities or have gained places at leading music conservatories. The school has a Symphony Orchestra and many other smaller choirs and instrumental ensembles, along with an annual House Singing Competition. The Music Department organises a concert every February at [[St John's, Smith Square]] in London. The school is also famous as the first place in England to host a complete cycle of the chamber music of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], under the direction of the then Head of Piano [[John Thwaites (musician)|John Thwaites]].\n\nChrist's Hospital was featured in the first series of the reality television programme ''[[Rock School]]'', in which [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] helped a group of pupils form their own rock band.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017211313/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml |date=17 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Mayor's Show 2008 Christ's Hospital.jpg|thumb|The [[Christ's Hospital Band]] participating in the Lord Mayor's Show in 2008]]\n\nThe school's most famous ensemble is its marching band, simply named [[Christ's Hospital Band]].

The school [[House system|houses]] are named after notable Old Blues (the CH-specific term for alumni), primarily writers. Each house has an \"A\" and \"B\" side, home to roughly 45 pupils. The houses are arranged from west to east as follows:\n\n===Avenue houses===\n\n*Peele \u2013 [[George Peele]] (boys)\n*Thornton \u2013 [[Edward Thornton (1766\u20131852)|Edward Thornton]]<ref>''Christ's Hospital'', G.A.T.

Leigh Hunt was originally the pair of preparatory houses, Prep A and Prep B, and were converted to junior houses on the abolition in 1964 of entry at the age of nine.\n\nThe sixteen original houses provided two dormitories (Upper Dorm and Lower Dorm) sleeping up to about 30 boys each. As the merger of the boys and girls approached, some dormitories were divided into cubicles, and subsequent developments created dormitories accommodating about twelve pupils each. Since 2001 there has been a rolling refurbishment programme, with the refurbished houses providing a range of accommodation: four-bed rooms for the junior pupils to one-bed rooms for the more senior pupils.\n\nUntil 1964, boys at Horsham lived in all-through houses from 2nd Form to Grecians (with the exception of Prep A and Prep B). Then houses were divided into senior houses (Peele, Thornton, Middleton, Coleridge and Lamb) and Junior houses (Barnes, Maine, Leigh Hunt) with boys transferring to a senior house after Little Erasmus. In conjunction with the merger, a further reorganisation occurred with each house converting to a senior side and a junior side. This system reverted to the all-through houses in 2000, now from 2nd Form to Deps.\n\n=== Grecians houses===\n\nYear 13 (Grecian) students move to Grecians houses, which provide a transitional style of life in preparation for university or life beyond school. The two Grecians houses were completed early in 2001 and have individual study bedrooms plus several general common rooms and kitchenettes shared by a group of seven to ten pupils.<ref>http://www.christs-hospital.org.uk/parents-handbook-dec09.pdf</ref> allowed them to prepare to live in mixed communal environment as they prepare themselves for university education.\n\n*Grecians West (for pupils who were previously in Peele, Thornton, Middleton, and Coleridge)\n*Grecians East (for pupils who were previously in Lamb, Barnes, Maine, and Leigh Hunt)\n\n==Controversies ==\n===Sexual abuse ===\nSexual abuse of pupils from 1969 to 2001<ref name=\"bbc20180713\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|author=|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref> led to six former teachers being convicted of offences after more than 20 former students made complaints to the police in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44654838|title=Teacher guilty of raping pupil|date=5 July 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/16353070.teacher-james-husband-from-york-jailed-for-17-years-for-raping-pupil|title=Teacher James Husband, from York, jailed for 17 years for raping pupil|date=13 July 2018|work=York Press|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref> The convicted former teachers were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{See|List of people educated at Christ's Hospital}}\nPeople educated at Christ's Hospital are called Old Blues.\n\n==Staff==\nNotable members of staff have included:\n*[[Edward Baldwin, 4th Earl Baldwin of Bewdley]]\n*[[Adrian Bawtree]]\n*[[Edward Buck (rower)|Edward Buck]]\n*[[Samuel Cobb (poet)|Samuel Cobb]]\n*[[Gerald Davies]]\n*[[Ralph Henry Carless Davis]]\n*[[John Flamsteed]] ([[Astronomer Royal]])\n*[[William Hamilton Fyfe]]\n*[[Steve Gatting]]\n*[[Bruce Grindlay]]\n*[[George Andrew Jacob]]\n*[[Craig Sellar Lang]]\n*[[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harrison |first1=Derek |title=Derrick Somerset Macnutt |url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/ximenes.htm |website=www.crossword.org.uk |accessdate=18 December 2018}}</ref>\n*[[William Wales (astronomer)]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|West Sussex|London|Schools}}\n*[[Christ's Hospital Band]]\n*[[Christ's Hospital railway station]]\n*[[Erasmus Smith]]\n*[[List of Victoria Crosses by school]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Davies-Jenkins|first1=Sue|title=Hang on tight : Christ's Hospital : from girlhood to Governor|date=2010|publisher=The Memoir Club|location=Durham|isbn=978-1-84104-499-6}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=G.

Founded in 1552 and received its first Royal Charter in 1553, Christ's Hospital follows much of the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] tradition. Since its establishment, Christ's Hospital has been a [[charity school]], with a core aim to offer children from humble backgrounds the chance of a better education.\n\n==Charitable foundation==\n[[File:quad DH.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Christ's Hospital quad towards dining hall. Picture taken from Big School]]\nChrist's Hospital is almost unique for a British independent school in that the majority of the students receive bursaries. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a [[Means test|means-tested]] basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school or their benefactors, so that pupils from all walks of life are able to have private education that would otherwise be beyond the means of their parents.\n\n[[File:CH FntAvQuad.jpg|thumb|left|Westward photo of Quad and Front Avenue. (View from Art School)]]\n\nThe trustees of the foundation are the Council of Almoners, chaired by the Treasurer of Christ's Hospital, who govern the foundation according to a Scheme of Administration granted by the [[Charity Commission]]. The historic Court of Governors survives as a formal institution consisting of over 650 benefactors but its powers have since the 19th century been largely transferred to the smaller Council of Almoners.\n\nIn 2007 Christ's Hospital was formally separated into two related [[Charitable organization|registered charities]]: Christ's Hospital Foundation<ref>{{EW charity|306975|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL FOUNDATION}}</ref> and Christ's Hospital School.<ref>{{EW charity|1120090|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL SCHOOL}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Christ's Hospital, engraved by Toms c.1770..jpg|thumb|Christ's Hospital's buildings in London in 1770]]\n[[File:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|left|thumb|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]]]\nChrist's Hospital was the result of the foundation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and confirmed by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], assisted by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], Bishop of London, and Sir Richard Dobbs, [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Thornbury, Walter. \"Christ's Hospital.\" ''Old and New London'': Volume 2.

Encouraged by a sermon from Ridley, exhorting mercy to the poor, the King wrote to the Lord Mayor encouraging him to action. This he did via a committee of 30 merchants. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had already granted the use of Greyfriars to the City for the relief of the poor and to house the homeless children which the magistrates had taken notice of.<ref>Nichols, John Gough.

The [[Royal Charter]] was granted and signed by its founder, Edward VI, the following year. The first treasurer was [[Richard Grafton]]. The Protestant foundation survived the [[Mary I of England|Marian]] period and in the 1560s it sent its first scholars to Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe school occupied Newgate as its major site for 350 years, but from time to time children were housed in other parts of the country. 32 children perished during the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague of 1665]]. In the following year the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the Hospital, except four cloisters and three wards, but there were no casualties among the children. Around 200 pupils were sent to Islington and Clerkenwell and then to Ware and Hertford.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century the buildings had been rebuilt with the assistance of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], a governor of Christ's Hospital, and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], who designed the Writing School (1696). The church of [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Christ Church, Newgate Street]], designed by Wren, replaced the damaged choir of the former Greyfriars' church and served as a place of worship for the children of Christ's Hospital in the City until the move to Horsham. Through the will of the royal jeweller, [[George Heriot]], it also became the inspiration for the foundation of [[George Heriot's School|George Heriot's Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]], which was the first of the \"Hospital Schools\" to be founded in Scotland.\n\nChrist's Hospital was given its second [[royal charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1673. This specifically created the [[Royal Mathematical School]], the original purpose of which was to train [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[navigation|navigators]] who would serve as naval officers and merchant seafarers. [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to His Majesty's Navy and from 1699 Vice-President of Christ's Hospital, made a considerable contribution to Christ's Hospital. [[Isaac Newton]], [[Jonas Moore]], [[John Flamsteed]], and  [[Edmund Halley]] contributed to plans for the course of study of the new school within the foundation.\n\n[[File:Blue Coat School Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|This early 19th-century picture shows the Great Hall on St. Matthew's Day, 21 September. On this day, two Grecians destined for scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge Universities gave orations in praise of the school, one in [[Latin]] and the other in English. The [[Antonio Verrio|Verrio]] painting can be seen along the wall on the right.]]\n\nThe girls of the hospital settled at [[Hertford]] from 1707. The governors had been paying a teacher in Hertford from 1653, and the removal of some children from London following the Great Fire strengthened the link with the town. In 1761, 200 boys under the age of ten along with the boys from Ware were relocated to Hertford. In 1778 the last girls were moved out of London to join the others at Hertford, where the school was rebuilt 1795\u20131798 to provide accommodation for the new numbers.\n\nChrist's Hospital's most famous upper master was [[James Boyer]] who presided from 1778 to 1799 and instructed [[James Leigh Hunt]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\nIn November 1815 the \u201cmost infamous Regency [[flagellant]]\u201d, an MP named [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Sir Eyre Coote,]] entered Christ's Hospital mathematical school, sent away the younger boys and paid the older ones for a session of mutual flogging. The school nurse arrived to find him buttoning his breeches; England's satirical press had come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment.

The Shaws' work included the old school hall (c.1825).\n\n[[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] started a tradition of Royal Presidents in 1854.\n\nA commission of inquiry in 1837 proposed reforms, and in 1864 the Taunton Commission investigated the endowed schools. As a result of this a greater number of girls were admitted. However, in the 1890s boys still outnumbered girls at Hertford.\n\nAnother commission in 1877 proposed a new site for the school, where all the boys would be taught. This proposal  was questioned by some of the Governors. The Duke of Cambridge said \"I am one of those who are perfectly prepared to go with the spirit of the age in which we live, but I confess that I am also one of those who do not love change for change\u2019s sake. To upset an old and long standing institution... is a very dangerous experiment to try.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal was carried out. {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of land outside Horsham in Sussex was purchased from the Aylesbury Dairy Company for \u00a347,500. The foundation stone was laid by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] on 23 October 1897, on behalf of the Sovereign, the date being the anniversary of the birthday of the founder. Architectural features from the old school buildings (the Grecians' Arch and the Wren Arch) were salvaged and incorporated in the new buildings.\n\nThe boys were relocated from Newgate and Hertford to the new site in 1902. Hertford became a girls-only school.\n\nOver the centuries Christ's Hospital has continued to enjoy royal patronage. In 1919, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] became the first Royal Patron, followed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1937 and HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] in 1953.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Constant Lambert as a Blue coat boy.jpg|thumb|The composer [[Constant Lambert]] as a pupil, wearing the traditional uniform]]\nLinks with the City and the [[Lord Mayor of London]] are well maintained, with an annual parade through the City of London on [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew's Day]] and a regular place in the [[Lord Mayor's Show]].\n\nOne of the Christ's Hospital traditions is marching into lunch with the band, which is done each day except Sunday, weather permitting.\n\nAnother is the annual speech-day parade, where the Lord Mayor of London and his procession watch the school perform a march-past through the main quad. They also join the school in chapel for a grand service, and eat lunch with the Grecian year and their parents. Lastly they move to Big School to hear the Senior Grecian's oration and witness the Grecian prize-giving. This is held on the Saturday at the start of the Summer Half Term.\n\n===Uniform===\nThe school's  Tudor [[school uniform|uniform]] consists of belted, long blue coats, knee-breeches, yellow socks, and [[bands (neckwear)|bands]] at the neck. The uniform has been in place since 1553.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stow|first=John|editor=Thoms, William J.|title=A Survey of London, written in the year 1598 by John Stow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vA9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA119|edition=New edition, 1842 |year=1598|publisher=Whittaker|page=119}}</ref> The nickname \"Blue-coat School\" comes from the blue coats worn by the students; however, the nickname used within the school community itself is \"Housey\" and the long coat is called a \"Housey coat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/29-records-of-christs-hospital-and-bluecoat-schools.pdf |format=PDF |title=London Metropolitan Archives : Information Leaflet Number 29 : Records of Christ's Hospital and Bluecoats Schools |website=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\nSecond and third form pupils wear a simple leather belt with a buckle.

This consists of a knee-length pleated skirt, summer jacket, yellow socks (for the boys and junior girls), and grey socks or grey/black tights for senior girls, as well as the long coat in winter, and the bands.\n\nIn 2011 students and alumni stated that they saw the uniform as an important way of giving the school a unique identity and unifying the school. Around that time the administrators had discussed the idea of updating the uniform. Over 95% of students voted in favour of keeping the original uniform.<ref name=\"Unifvote\">\"Students Vote to Keep Tudor Uniform.\" British Heritage 32, no. 2 (May 2011): 10.

The school was rated 'excellent' (the top grade) in the report released in January 2013. The optional term 'Exceptional' was not used.

Famous alumni of Christ's Hospital Music School include conductors Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Charles Hazlewood]], [[Adrian Bawtree]], and Simon Joly, trumpeter [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]] (formerly Principal Trumpet of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), composer [[Tim Benjamin]], and composer and conductor [[Constant Lambert]].\n\nThe school's chapel has a large five-manual [[Rushworth and Dreaper]] organ, one of four organs in the School (the others being a 3-manual 1829 Hill in Big School, played on by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and [[Karg-Elert]], a 2-manual [[Henry Willis & Sons|Father Willis]] in the Dining Hall, and a Flight and Robson chamber organ in the Court Room). The near 150-strong Chapel Choir has made many recordings and through these has earned an excellent reputation.\n\nThroughout the school's history, many musically gifted pupils have gone on to take up choral and organ scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge universities or have gained places at leading music conservatories. The school has a Symphony Orchestra and many other smaller choirs and instrumental ensembles, along with an annual House Singing Competition. The Music Department organises a concert every February at [[St John's, Smith Square]] in London. The school is also famous as the first place in England to host a complete cycle of the chamber music of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], under the direction of the then Head of Piano [[John Thwaites (musician)|John Thwaites]].\n\nChrist's Hospital was featured in the first series of the reality television programme ''[[Rock School]]'', in which [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] helped a group of pupils form their own rock band.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017211313/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml |date=17 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Mayor's Show 2008 Christ's Hospital.jpg|thumb|The [[Christ's Hospital Band]] participating in the Lord Mayor's Show in 2008]]\n\nThe school's most famous ensemble is its marching band, simply named [[Christ's Hospital Band]].

The band led the procession at the Queen's 80th birthday parade in London on 21 April 2006 and has played at [[Twickenham Stadium]] on a number of occasions.\n\n===Drama===\nAn Arts Centre complex designed by architect Bill Howell was opened in 1974, including a theatre with Tudor-style auditorium, an extension to the music school, the 'Octagon' rehearsal/performance space, and classrooms.\n\nThe Christ's Hospital Arts Centre served as a principal arts venue for Horsham and the surrounding area until the establishment of an arts centre in Horsham in the 1980s. A programme of performances continues to be open to the public.\n\nFormer pupils in theatre and film include [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Leo Gregory]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1639572,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=How I found my inner hippy | first=Will | last=Hodgkinson | date=11 November 2005 | accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> [[James D'Arcy]], [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] and [[Roger Allam]].\n\n== Names of year groups ==\nEach year group has a particular name, unique to Christ's Hospital.

The school [[House system|houses]] are named after notable Old Blues (the CH-specific term for alumni), primarily writers. Each house has an \"A\" and \"B\" side, home to roughly 45 pupils. The houses are arranged from west to east as follows:\n\n===Avenue houses===\n\n*Peele \u2013 [[George Peele]] (boys)\n*Thornton \u2013 [[Edward Thornton (1766\u20131852)|Edward Thornton]]<ref>''Christ's Hospital'', G.A.T.

Leigh Hunt was originally the pair of preparatory houses, Prep A and Prep B, and were converted to junior houses on the abolition in 1964 of entry at the age of nine.\n\nThe sixteen original houses provided two dormitories (Upper Dorm and Lower Dorm) sleeping up to about 30 boys each. As the merger of the boys and girls approached, some dormitories were divided into cubicles, and subsequent developments created dormitories accommodating about twelve pupils each. Since 2001 there has been a rolling refurbishment programme, with the refurbished houses providing a range of accommodation: four-bed rooms for the junior pupils to one-bed rooms for the more senior pupils.\n\nUntil 1964, boys at Horsham lived in all-through houses from 2nd Form to Grecians (with the exception of Prep A and Prep B). Then houses were divided into senior houses (Peele, Thornton, Middleton, Coleridge and Lamb) and Junior houses (Barnes, Maine, Leigh Hunt) with boys transferring to a senior house after Little Erasmus. In conjunction with the merger, a further reorganisation occurred with each house converting to a senior side and a junior side. This system reverted to the all-through houses in 2000, now from 2nd Form to Deps.\n\n=== Grecians houses===\n\nYear 13 (Grecian) students move to Grecians houses, which provide a transitional style of life in preparation for university or life beyond school. The two Grecians houses were completed early in 2001 and have individual study bedrooms plus several general common rooms and kitchenettes shared by a group of seven to ten pupils.<ref>http://www.christs-hospital.org.uk/parents-handbook-dec09.pdf</ref> allowed them to prepare to live in mixed communal environment as they prepare themselves for university education.\n\n*Grecians West (for pupils who were previously in Peele, Thornton, Middleton, and Coleridge)\n*Grecians East (for pupils who were previously in Lamb, Barnes, Maine, and Leigh Hunt)\n\n==Controversies ==\n===Sexual abuse ===\nSexual abuse of pupils from 1969 to 2001<ref name=\"bbc20180713\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|author=|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref> led to six former teachers being convicted of offences after more than 20 former students made complaints to the police in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44654838|title=Teacher guilty of raping pupil|date=5 July 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/16353070.teacher-james-husband-from-york-jailed-for-17-years-for-raping-pupil|title=Teacher James Husband, from York, jailed for 17 years for raping pupil|date=13 July 2018|work=York Press|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref> The convicted former teachers were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{See|List of people educated at Christ's Hospital}}\nPeople educated at Christ's Hospital are called Old Blues.\n\n==Staff==\nNotable members of staff have included:\n*[[Edward Baldwin, 4th Earl Baldwin of Bewdley]]\n*[[Adrian Bawtree]]\n*[[Edward Buck (rower)|Edward Buck]]\n*[[Samuel Cobb (poet)|Samuel Cobb]]\n*[[Gerald Davies]]\n*[[Ralph Henry Carless Davis]]\n*[[John Flamsteed]] ([[Astronomer Royal]])\n*[[William Hamilton Fyfe]]\n*[[Steve Gatting]]\n*[[Bruce Grindlay]]\n*[[George Andrew Jacob]]\n*[[Craig Sellar Lang]]\n*[[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harrison |first1=Derek |title=Derrick Somerset Macnutt |url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/ximenes.htm |website=www.crossword.org.uk |accessdate=18 December 2018}}</ref>\n*[[William Wales (astronomer)]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|West Sussex|London|Schools}}\n*[[Christ's Hospital Band]]\n*[[Christ's Hospital railway station]]\n*[[Erasmus Smith]]\n*[[List of Victoria Crosses by school]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Davies-Jenkins|first1=Sue|title=Hang on tight : Christ's Hospital : from girlhood to Governor|date=2010|publisher=The Memoir Club|location=Durham|isbn=978-1-84104-499-6}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=G.

It was released on April 29, 2016, by [[Cash Money Records]], [[Republic Records]], and [[Young Money Entertainment]]. Recording sessions took place from 2015 to 2016, with both Drake and his longtime collaborator and record producer [[40 (record producer)|40]] serving as the record's executive producers. 40 also primarily handled the production on the album alongside each of these several other record producers such as [[Nineteen85]], Maneesh Bidaye, [[Kanye West]], and [[Majid Jordan|Jordan Ullman]], among others. The album contains the elements of genres such as [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[dancehall]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[Pop music|pop]], among others.\n\n''Views'' was supported by five [[Single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Hotline Bling]]\", \"[[One Dance]]\", \"[[Pop Style]]\", \"[[Controlla]]\", and \"[[Too Good]]\". The album received lukewarm reviews from critics, many of whom found it to be an overlong retread of Drake's previous work. Despite this, it spent 13 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was certified [[RIAA certification|six-times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

It was released on April 29, 2016, by [[Cash Money Records]], [[Republic Records]], and [[Young Money Entertainment]]. Recording sessions took place from 2015 to 2016, with both Drake and his longtime collaborator and record producer [[40 (record producer)|40]] serving as the record's executive producers. 40 also primarily handled the production on the album alongside each of these several other record producers such as [[Nineteen85]], Maneesh Bidaye, [[Kanye West]], and [[Majid Jordan|Jordan Ullman]], among others. The album contains the elements of genres such as [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[dancehall]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[Pop music|pop]], among others.\n\n''Views'' was supported by five [[Single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Hotline Bling]]\", \"[[One Dance]]\", \"[[Pop Style]]\", \"[[Controlla]]\", and \"[[Too Good]]\". The album received lukewarm reviews from critics, many of whom found it to be an overlong retread of Drake's previous work. Despite this, it spent 13 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was certified [[RIAA certification|six times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

Since the demise of [[Apartheid]] it remains a societal and an institutionalised problem.\n\n==Colonial racism==\n\nDuring the Colonial era, the Cape served as strategic base for the Colonial expansionist interests in the east. For this purpose settlements were established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652, followed by Britain seizing the Cape Colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, resulting in some areas being governed by the British and some by the Dutch.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa|title=South Africa - Growth of the colonial economy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe region attracted ivory and slave traders who imported slaves for wheat farming and viticulture to serve the European settlements. In response to Colonial subjugation, fleeing black natives and slaves, joined existing groups such as the Xhosa or formed groups that were headed by warlords such as those of Bloem, Kok and Barends families. By the late 18th century, Arabs and Europeans traded beads, brass, cloth, alcohol and firearms in return for slaves, ivory, gold, wax, cattle and skins. The profits from these trade practices encouraged the warlords to hunt elephants and slaves by raiding the local communities such as Rolong, Tlhaping, Huruthshe and Ngwaketse. During the [[Difaqane]], the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overran many smaller tribes and enslaved them.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAlthough slavery was formally abolished in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]], slaves were continued to be imported from Britain's established settlements in India and the East Indies. The practice of importing slaves from India stretches back to the 1600s when the Dutch bought slaves from various parts of India who were sold by the then Muslim rulers. By the early part of the 18th century, 80% of the slaves were South Asians who were not just from the Indian subcontinent but also those South Asians who were living in South-East Asian countries such as Java.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-slavery-and-early-colonisation-south-africa|title=History of slavery and early colonisation in South Africa &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman-Dutch law defined slaves as property that could be traded, bought and sold, a form of slavery known as '[[chattel slavery]]'. There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the Colonial period such as whipping, starvation, being forced to work for long hours, laborers having to carry passes, being subject to high taxation, not being able to walk on the sidewalks, banned from living, entering or working in certain areas such as the Orange Free State.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Other examples include allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]].\n\n{{quote|\nFor Whites\u2014Biscuit, 1/4 lb.; Maize meal, 3 oz.<br/>\nFor Indians and Kaffirs\u2014Maize meal, 8 oz.<br/>\nEuropeans\u2014Fresh meat, 1 lb.<br/>\nKaffirs\u2014Fresh meat, 1-1/4 lbs.

Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.\n\nThe Indian community has been subject to Zulu racist attacks dating back to the arrival of indentured labor in South Africa which ultimately resulted in the [[Durban Riots]] of 1949 followed by riots in 1985 where homes for 1500 Indians were set on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-09/news/mn-2323_1_black-youths|title=Zulus Attack Indians Near Durban; Death Toll Mounts|first=United Press|last=International|date=9 August 1985|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Governmental racism under Apartheid ===\nThe first example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Population Registration Act]]''. This act was the first to force citizens to be registered under their race, and this set the stage for later racial tension. One example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act]]'', which was passed into law in 1959. This law forced White citizens to live in separate areas than Black citizens, and reserved much less land for the Black citizens to live, despite them making up a large majority of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-apartheid-south-africa|title=A history of Apartheid in South Africa|last=sahoboss|date=2016-05-06|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> The way the South African government did this at the time was by reserving off pieces of land called [[Bantustans]], and forcing the Black South Africans on to these pieces of land. There were 10 different Bantustans in total, all for separate ethnic groups. Once they moved on to these lands, the Black South Africans lost their rights as South Africans, and were forced to become permanent residents of the reserves. They were expected to run their own governments once they had arrived. \u00a0Economic conditions on these lands were not satisfactory for the people there, as the South African government put minimal effort policy-wise into developing these regions economically. Most of the time, residents of Bantustans would have to commute hours by bus or train to industrial zones on the border of their Bantustan. Even though the South African Government put lots of money towards trying to keep the Bantustans viable, the local governments were still plagued by corruption, so normal people rarely felt the effects of the government money. In the 1970\u2019s 4 of these Bantustans became independent and separated entirely from the South African government, and this was the intent of the Bantustans. To keep all the Black citizens out from South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Laura|date=2017-07-27|title=History of South Africa's Bantustans|url=http://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-80|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.80|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of restricting legislation in South Africa is the ''Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952''. This act forced Black South African citizens to carry their passbooks with them at all times. If someone was found without their passbook, they could be arrested for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community, which would eventually spark the defiance campaign of 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe oppressive nature of these apartheid laws sparked some resistance within the Black South African community, and several oppositional groups were formed. One of these groups that emerged was the ANC ([[African National Congress]]), a group which eventually became involved in many resistance activities. One movement the ANC got involved in was a defiance campaign in the Black suburb of Sharpeville. This eventually led to the [[Sharpeville massacre]], where 69 Black South Africans were killed, and 180 more were injured. This event resulted in the bloodiest apartheid protest that South Africa would see, and in the moment the Black South African community was horrified. In response, the following week was full of demonstrations, protests and marches. Because of this, the South African government saw fit to declare a state of emergency, and arrested thousands of people who had been protesting. Numbers approached 10,000 people by May, and many of these people were not released for months afterwards. Also in the fallout of the Sharpeville massacre, the South African government banned any organisations that were considered a threat to public safety or public order. This included organisations such as the ANC and the PAC (another organisation that was committed to activism for Black South Africans through peaceful protesting).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sharpeville-massacre/|title=Sharpeville Massacre \u2022 BlackPast|date=2009-02-22|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nUnder apartheid, Black women were affected to an extreme degree due to discriminatory racial and gender laws. There were not many opportunities for women to become \u00a0political leaders, as many organisations allowed male membership only, so not many women did get very involved with politics. There were several organizations that let women join, or had entirely separate organizations there for women to join, one such being the ANCWL or ANC Women\u2019s League. In a protest of the ''[[Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act|Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952]]'' as mentioned above and several other pieces of legislation, many women participated in movements against the government for the first time in the form of the Defiance campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid|title=Women and the struggle against Apartheid &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref> The defiance campaign was a movement organized in part by the ANC because of new apartheid legislation from the government. Women were not the only people to take part in this campaign, but the inclusion of women is noteworthy because this was the first campaign to see major participation from women. The movement itself involved thousands of Black citizens doing nonviolent things that would normally be considered as civil disobedience, such as going into areas that only White people were allowed into, or burning their pass books. The idea behind the movement, was that if enough Black people flooded the South African prison and judicial system, then it would force the government to reform the apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested in a matter of months, but the campaign did not accomplish its goal of forcing radical change. However, it did capture the attention of the global community, and that of the United Nations. In time the UN would launch an investigation into the apartheid policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/defiance-campaign-1952|title=Defiance Campaign 1952|last=Anonymous|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980's, resistance to apartheid became extreme. The [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] was formed in order to try and unite people all over to join in the fight against government oppression. The leader of the front, [[Allan Boesak]], called for organizations all over South Africa to help him. This included churches, civic associations, trade unions, student organizations, and sports bodies. The UDF became extremely popular among the Black community, and helped unite everyone who was fighting for equality, something that had not happened in the past. The government\u2019s response was to declare another national emergency, and again South Africa saw thousands of arrests and hundreds of killing. However by 1990, the burden of so much public violence was too much. The government was losing its tight grip on the country, and eventually the state president, [[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]], decided that reform was absolutely necessary. This led to the end of apartheid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/united-democratic-front-udf|title=United Democratic Front (UDF)|last=tinashe|date=2011-03-30|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Apartheid racism ==\n\n=== Racism and related violence against black people ===\n\nAlthough Apartheid was abolished in South Africa, and overt racism against black people is on the decline, [[institutional racism]] is still common in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-01-26-00-institutional-racism-is-still-alive-and-kicking-in-the-workplace|title=Institutional racism is still alive and kicking in the workplaces|work=mg|access-date=2019-04-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPenny Sparrow, a 70-year-old real estate agent suffering of blindness who lives in the coastal city of Durban compared African people as a whole to dirty monkeys that litter on the previously white only beaches  and was apologetic for her remarks, defending them as being taken out of context.

Since the demise of [[Apartheid]] it remains a societal and an institutionalised problem.\n\n==Colonial racism==\n\nDuring the Colonial era, the Cape served as strategic base for the Colonial expansionist interests in the east. For this purpose settlements were established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652, followed by Britain seizing the Cape Colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, resulting in some areas being governed by the British and some by the Dutch.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa|title=South Africa - Growth of the colonial economy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe region attracted ivory and slave traders who imported slaves for wheat farming and viticulture to serve the European settlements. In response to Colonial subjugation, fleeing black natives and slaves, joined existing groups such as the Xhosa or formed groups that were headed by warlords such as those of Bloem, Kok and Barends families. By the late 18th century, Arabs and Europeans traded beads, brass, cloth, alcohol and firearms in return for slaves, ivory, gold, wax, cattle and skins. The profits from these trade practices encouraged the warlords to hunt elephants and slaves by raiding the local communities such as Rolong, Tlhaping, Huruthshe and Ngwaketse. During the [[Difaqane]], the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overran many smaller tribes and enslaved them.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAlthough slavery was formally abolished in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]], slaves were continued to be imported from Britain's established settlements in India and the East Indies. The practice of importing slaves from India stretches back to the 1600s when the Dutch bought slaves from various parts of India who were sold by the then Muslim rulers. By the early part of the 18th century, 80% of the slaves were South Asians who were not just from the Indian subcontinent but also those South Asians who were living in South-East Asian countries such as Java.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-slavery-and-early-colonisation-south-africa|title=History of slavery and early colonisation in South Africa &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman-Dutch law defined slaves as property that could be traded, bought and sold, a form of slavery known as '[[chattel slavery]]'. There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the Colonial period such as whipping, starvation, being forced to work for long hours, laborers having to carry passes, being subject to high taxation, not being able to walk on the sidewalks, banned from living, entering or working in certain areas such as the Orange Free State.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Other examples include allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]].\n\n{{quote|\nFor Whites\u2014Biscuit, 1/4 lb.; Maize meal, 3 oz.<br/>\nFor Indians and Kaffirs\u2014Maize meal, 8 oz.<br/>\nEuropeans\u2014Fresh meat, 1 lb.<br/>\nKaffirs\u2014Fresh meat, 1-1/4 lbs.

Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.\n\nThe Indian community has been subject to Zulu racist attacks dating back to the arrival of indentured labor in South Africa which ultimately resulted in the [[Durban Riots]] of 1949 followed by riots in 1985 where homes for 1500 Indians were set on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-09/news/mn-2323_1_black-youths|title=Zulus Attack Indians Near Durban; Death Toll Mounts|first=United Press|last=International|date=9 August 1985|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Governmental racism under Apartheid ===\nThe first example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Population Registration Act]]''. This act was the first to force citizens to be registered under their race, and this set the stage for later racial tension. One example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act]]'', which was passed into law in 1959. This law forced White citizens to live in separate areas than Black citizens, and reserved much less land for the Black citizens to live, despite them making up a large majority of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-apartheid-south-africa|title=A history of Apartheid in South Africa|last=sahoboss|date=2016-05-06|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> The way the South African government did this at the time was by reserving off pieces of land called [[Bantustans]], and forcing the Black South Africans on to these pieces of land. There were 10 different Bantustans in total, all for separate ethnic groups. Once they moved on to these lands, the Black South Africans lost their rights as South Africans, and were forced to become permanent residents of the reserves. They were expected to run their own governments once they had arrived. \u00a0Economic conditions on these lands were not satisfactory for the people there, as the South African government put minimal effort policy-wise into developing these regions economically. Most of the time, residents of Bantustans would have to commute hours by bus or train to industrial zones on the border of their Bantustan. Even though the South African Government put lots of money towards trying to keep the Bantustans viable, the local governments were still plagued by corruption, so normal people rarely felt the effects of the government money. In the 1970\u2019s 4 of these Bantustans became independent and separated entirely from the South African government, and this was the intent of the Bantustans. To keep all the Black citizens out from South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Laura|date=2017-07-27|title=History of South Africa's Bantustans|url=http://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-80|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.80|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of restricting legislation in South Africa is the ''Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952''. This act forced Black South African citizens to carry their passbooks with them at all times. If someone was found without their passbook, they could be arrested for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community, which would eventually spark the defiance campaign of 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe oppressive nature of these apartheid laws sparked some resistance within the Black South African community, and several oppositional groups were formed. One of these groups that emerged was the ANC ([[African National Congress]]), a group which eventually became involved in many resistance activities. One movement the ANC got involved in was a defiance campaign in the Black suburb of Sharpeville. This eventually led to the [[Sharpeville massacre]], where 69 Black South Africans were killed, and 180 more were injured. This event resulted in the bloodiest apartheid protest that South Africa would see, and in the moment the Black South African community was horrified. In response, the following week was full of demonstrations, protests and marches. Because of this, the South African government saw fit to declare a state of emergency, and arrested thousands of people who had been protesting. Numbers approached 10,000 people by May, and many of these people were not released for months afterwards. Also in the fallout of the Sharpeville massacre, the South African government banned any organisations that were considered a threat to public safety or public order. This included organisations such as the ANC and the PAC (another organisation that was committed to activism for Black South Africans through peaceful protesting).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sharpeville-massacre/|title=Sharpeville Massacre \u2022 BlackPast|date=2009-02-22|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nUnder apartheid, Black women were affected to an extreme degree due to discriminatory racial and gender laws. There were not many opportunities for women to become \u00a0political leaders, as many organisations allowed male membership only, so not many women did get very involved with politics. There were several organizations that let women join, or had entirely separate organizations there for women to join, one such being the ANCWL or ANC Women\u2019s League. In a protest of the ''[[Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act|Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952]]'' as mentioned above and several other pieces of legislation, many women participated in movements against the government for the first time in the form of the Defiance campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid|title=Women and the struggle against Apartheid &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref> The defiance campaign was a movement organized in part by the ANC because of new apartheid legislation from the government. Women were not the only people to take part in this campaign, but the inclusion of women is noteworthy because this was the first campaign to see major participation from women. The movement itself involved thousands of Black citizens doing nonviolent things that would normally be considered as civil disobedience, such as going into areas that only White people were allowed into, or burning their pass books. The idea behind the movement, was that if enough Black people flooded the South African prison and judicial system, then it would force the government to reform the apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested in a matter of months, but the campaign did not accomplish its goal of forcing radical change. However, it did capture the attention of the global community, and that of the United Nations. In time the UN would launch an investigation into the apartheid policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/defiance-campaign-1952|title=Defiance Campaign 1952|last=Anonymous|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980's, resistance to apartheid became extreme. The [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] was formed in order to try and unite people all over to join in the fight against government oppression. The leader of the front, [[Allan Boesak]], called for organizations all over South Africa to help him. This included churches, civic associations, trade unions, student organizations, and sports bodies. The UDF became extremely popular among the Black community, and helped unite everyone who was fighting for equality, something that had not happened in the past. The government\u2019s response was to declare another national emergency, and again South Africa saw thousands of arrests and hundreds of killing.

Lacking confidence in the novel as a whole, Hogg extracted certain sections for separate publication: poems from the novel appeared in a number of journals; 'The Laird of Peatstacknowe's Tale' was retitled 'Marion's Jock' for ''Altrive Tales'' in 1832; 'The Poet's Tale' became 'The Three Sisters' in ''Fraser's Magazine'' for May 1835, but as a poem; and most extensively the Roxburgh material became 'The Siege of Roxburgh' in the posthumous final volume of ''Tales and Sketches'' (1837). The standard modern critical edition of the novel, by Judy King and Graham Tulloch, was published by Edinburgh University Press as a volume of the Stirling/South Carolina research edition of The Collected Works of James Hogg in 2012.\n\n==Plot summary==\nDuring the reign of Robert II, King of Scots (1371\u201290), the English Sir Philip Musgrave captures Roxburgh castle and is committed to hold it for a specified period to satisfy his mistress Lady Jane Howard. James, Earl of Douglas, takes up a challenge by Robert's daughter Princess Margaret to recapture it within the same period. Sir Walter Scott of Rankleburn assists Douglas indirectly by harassing the English supply chain, to his own advantage. \n\tBoth Jane and Margaret assume male disguise in order to keep an eye on their respective lovers. After Margaret has recognised Jane and arranged for her to be delivered up to Douglas, she (disguised as her own page) is captured by the English garrison at Roxburgh and executed. A monk conveys instructions to Douglas from her spirit to take revenge. \n\tThe central part of the novel focusses on a delegation dispatched by Sir Walter Scott to ascertain the future fortunes of his family from the wizard Michael Scott at his castle of Aikwood. It consists of the bard Colley Carol, Thomas Craik (the Deil's Tam), Gibby Jordan of Peatstacknowe, and a friar, with Charlie Scott as leader and a girl and a boy (Delany Hall and Elias) as presents. They encounter a hostile reception. After a series of supernatural events, egress from the castle having become impossible, the wizard arranges a story-telling competition. More supernatural events follow.\n\tBack at Roxburgh, faced with the execution of his captured brother and defilement of Jane, Sir Philip takes his own life. In exchange for two baronies Sir Walter Scott takes direct action, capturing the castle by disguising his men as cattle. Margaret tests Douglas's commitment to herself by a further adoption of a disguise, and the couple marry. After a competition among the knights for ladies' favours, the friar unites Jane in marriage with Charlie, and Delany with Colley. The novel ends with an account by Gibby of Michael Scott's death in combat with a diabolical rival.\n\n==Principal characters==\n''Central characters in bold''\n\n[[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]], King of Scots\n\nHis queen\n\n'''Princess Margaret''', his daughter\n\n'''Sir Philip Musgrave'''\n\nSir Richard Musgrave, his brother\n\n'''Lady Jane Howard''', his mistress\n\n'''James, Earl of Douglas and Mar'''\n\n'''Sir Walter Scott of Rankleburn and Murdieston''' (Sir Ringan Redhough in pre-2012 editions)\n\nLady Rankleburn, his wife\n\nDickie o' Dryhope, his cousin\n\nSimon of Gemelscleuch\n\n'''Charlie Scott of Yardbire'''\n\n'''Patrick Chisholm of Castleweary'''\n\n'''Dan Chisholm''', his son\n\n'''Bess Chisholm''', his daughter\n\nSir Stephen Vernon\n\nSandy Yellowlees, a fisherman\n\nHenry Clavering, an English officer\n\nMary Kirkmichael of Balmedie, a Scottish maid of honour\n\nBenjamin, a monk\n\n'''Colley Carol''', a poet\n\n'''Gibby Jordan, Laird of Peatstacknowe'''\n\nThomas Craik (The Deil's Tam)\n\n'''Roger, a Friar'''\n\n'''Michael Scott of Aikwood''', a wizard\n\nPrim, Prig, and Pricker, his three diabolical imps\n\nDelany Hall\n\nElias\n\nJock Robson of the Trows, a shepherd\n\n'''Will Laidlaw of Craik'''\n\nLady Neville of Ravensworth\n\n==Chapter summary==\nVolume One\n\nCh.1: The English Sir Philip Musgrave has taken Roxburgh castle and is committed to hold it until the end of the Christmas holidays to satisfy his mistress Lady Jane Howard.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]].

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The ''Isra\u02be'' is the part of the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem. It began when Muhammad was in the Great Mosque, and the [[Holy Spirit in Islam|Archangel Jibr\u012bl]] (or Jibr\u0101\u02be\u012bl, [[Gabriel]])  came to him, and brought [[Buraq]], the traditional heavenly mount of the prophets. Buraq carried Muhammad to [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], the \"Farthest Mosque\", in [[Jerusalem in Islam|Jerusalem]].

Muhammad was then taken to [[Sidrat al-Muntaha]] \u2013 a holy tree in the seventh heaven that Gabriel was not allowed to pass.

After Muhammad meets with Abraham, he continues on to meet Allah without Gabriel. Allah tells Muhammad that his people must pray 50 times a day, but as Muhammad descends back to Earth, he meets Moses who tells Muhammad to go back to God and ask for fewer prayers because 50 is too many. Muhammad goes between Moses and God nine times, until the prayers are reduced to the five daily prayers, which God will reward tenfold.<ref>{{cite book|last1=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari volume VI: Muhammad at Mecca|date=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-88706-706-9}}</ref> That again, Moses told Muhammad to ask for even lesser but Muhammad felt ashamed and said that even with lesser prayer times, his followers might not even perform diligently and said he is thankful for the five.\n\n[[Al-Tabari]] is a classic and authentic source for Islamic research. His description of the Mi\u02bfraj is just as simplified as the description given above, which is where other narratives and hadiths of the Mi\u02bfraj stem from, as well as word of mouth. While this is the simplest description of the Mi\u02bfraj, others include more details about the prophets that Muhammad meets. In accounts written by Muslim, [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], [[Ibn Ishaq]], Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, physical descriptions of the prophets are given. [[Adam]] is described first as being Muhammad's father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{cite book|last1=Vuckovic|first1=Brooke Olsen|title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi\u02bfraj in the Formation of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96785-6}}</ref> Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi\u02bfraj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad's. Aaron is described as Muhammad's brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad's father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nSome narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad's chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad's chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place\u2014before or after the ascent\u2014but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad's spiritual righteousness.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\n====Ibn \u2018Abbas' Primitive Version====\nIbn \u02bfAbbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), [[Ishim (angel)#In Islam|Half-Fire Half-Snow angel]] (who provides an example of God's power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the [[Maalik|Guardian of Hellfire]] (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad's ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn \u02bfAbbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called [[cherub]]im. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God's creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn \u2018Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\">{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Tracing the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}</ref> These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn \u2018Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.\n\nSome debates that Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad's encounter with God. Ibn \u02bfAbbas illustrates God as [[Anthropomorphization|anthropomorphed]] being who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn \u02bfAbbas's authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn \u2018Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn \u02bfAbbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn \u2018Abbas's Primitive Version.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\"/>\n\n==Modern Muslim observance==\nThe ''Lailat al-Mi\u02bfraj'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|ar|Lailatu 'l-Mi\u02bfr\u0101j}}), also known as ''Shab-e-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-bn|\u09b6\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ae\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u099c|\u0160obe Meraj}}, {{lang-fa|\u0634\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|fa|\u0160ab-e Mi'r\u00e2j}}) in Iran, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and ''Mira\u00e7 Kandili'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is the [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] celebrating the Isra and Mi\u02bfraj. Some Muslims celebrate this event by offering optional prayers during this night, and in some Muslim countries, by illuminating cities with electric lights and candles. The celebrations around this day tend to focus on every Muslim who wants to celebrate it. Worshippers gather into mosques and perform prayer and supplication. Some people may pass their knowledge on to others by telling them the story on how Muhammad's heart was purified by the [[Gabriel|archangel Gabriel]], who filled him with knowledge and faith in preparation to enter the seven levels of heaven. After [[salah]], food and treats are served.<ref name=times/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Religions \u2013 Islam: Lailat al Miraj|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0191/9101056.htm|title=WRMEA \u2013 Islam in America|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}</ref>\n\n[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to [[heaven]].

It is considered by some to have happened just over a year before the Hijrah, on the 27th of [[Rajab]]; but this date is not always recognized. This date would correspond to the [[Julian calendar|Julian date]] of 26 February 621, or, if from the previous year, 8 March 620. In [[Twelver]] [[Iran]] for example, Rajab 27 is the day of Muhammad's first calling or ''Mab'as''.

The ''Isra\u02be'' is the part of the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem. It began when Muhammad was in the Great Mosque, and the [[Holy Spirit in Islam|Archangel Jibr\u012bl]] (or Jibr\u0101\u02be\u012bl, [[Gabriel]])  came to him, and brought [[Buraq]], the traditional heavenly mount of the prophets. Buraq carried Muhammad to [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], the \"Farthest Mosque\", in [[Jerusalem in Islam|Jerusalem]]. Muhammad alighted, tethered Buraq to the [[Temple Mount]] and performed prayer, where on God's command he was tested by Gabriel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Momina|title=isra wal miraj|url=http://www.chowrangi.com/al-isra-wal-miraj-the-night-journey-and-the-ascension-of-prophet-muhammad-peace-and-blessings-be-upon-him.html|publisher=chourangi|accessdate=16 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615232240/http://www.chowrangi.com/al-isra-wal-miraj-the-night-journey-and-the-ascension-of-prophet-muhammad-peace-and-blessings-be-upon-him.html|archivedate=15 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duas.org/articles/merajarticle.htm|title=Meraj Article|work=duas.org}}</ref> It was told by [[Anas ibn Malik]] that Muhammad said: \"Jibra'il brought me a vessel of wine, a vessel of water and a vessel of milk, and I chose the milk.

Muhammad was then taken to [[Sidrat al-Muntaha]] \u2013 a holy tree in the seventh heaven that Gabriel was not allowed to pass. According to Islamic tradition, God instructed Muhammad that [[Muslim]]s must pray fifty times per day; however, Moses told Muhammad that it was very difficult for the people and urged Muhammad to ask for a reduction, until finally it was reduced to five times per day.<ref name=times/><ref>IslamAwareness.net \u2013 [http://www.islamawareness.net/Isra/isra.html Isra and Mi'raj, The Details]</ref><ref>[[About.com]] \u2013 [http://islam.about.com/od/otherdays/a/isra-miraj.htm The Meaning of Isra' and Mi\u02bfraj in Islam]</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Vuckovic| first = Brooke Olson| title = Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi'raj in the Formation of Islam (Religion in History, Society and Culture)| date = 30 December 2004| publisher = [[Routledge]]| isbn = 978-0-415-96785-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Mahmoud| first = Omar| title = Muhammad: an evolution of God| url = https://books.google.com/?id=hqiQwmTDYBUC&pg=PA56&dq=isra+and+miraj#v=onepage&q=isra%20and%20miraj&f=false | accessdate = 27 March 2011| date = 25 April 2008| publisher = [[AuthorHouse]]| isbn = 978-1-4343-5586-7| page = 56| chapter = The Journey to Meet God Almighty by Muhammad\u2014Al-Isra}}</ref>\n\n====The Mi\u2018raj====\nThere are different accounts of what occurred during the Mi\u02bfraj, but most narratives have the same elements: Muhammad ascended into heaven with the angel Gabriel and met a different prophet at each of the seven levels of heaven; first [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], then [[John the Baptist#Islam|John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], then [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph]], then [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]], then [[Aaron]], then [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], and lastly [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]]. After Muhammad meets with Abraham, he continues on to meet Allah without Gabriel. Allah tells Muhammad that his people must pray 50 times a day, but as Muhammad descends back to Earth, he meets Moses who tells Muhammad to go back to God and ask for fewer prayers because 50 is too many. Muhammad goes between Moses and God nine times, until the prayers are reduced to the five daily prayers, which God will reward tenfold.<ref>{{cite book|last1=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari volume VI: Muhammad at Mecca|date=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-88706-706-9}}</ref> That again, Moses told Muhammad to ask for even lesser but Muhammad felt ashamed and said that even with lesser prayer times, his followers might not even perform diligently and said he is thankful for the five.\n\n[[Al-Tabari]] is a classic and authentic source for Islamic research. His description of the Mi\u02bfraj is just as simplified as the description given above, which is where other narratives and hadiths of the Mi\u02bfraj stem from, as well as word of mouth. While this is the simplest description of the Mi\u02bfraj, others include more details about the prophets that Muhammad meets. In accounts written by Muslim, [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], [[Ibn Ishaq]], Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, physical descriptions of the prophets are given. [[Adam]] is described first as being Muhammad's father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{cite book|last1=Vuckovic|first1=Brooke Olsen|title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi\u02bfraj in the Formation of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96785-6}}</ref> Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi\u02bfraj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad's. Aaron is described as Muhammad's brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad's father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nSome narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad's chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad's chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place\u2014before or after the ascent\u2014but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad's spiritual righteousness.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\n====Ibn \u2018Abbas' Primitive Version====\nIbn \u02bfAbbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), [[Ishim (angel)#In Islam|Half-Fire Half-Snow angel]] (who provides an example of God's power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the [[Maalik|Guardian of Hellfire]] (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad's ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn \u02bfAbbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called [[cherub]]im. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God's creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn \u2018Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\">{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Tracing the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}</ref> These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn \u2018Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.\n\nSome debates that Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad's encounter with God. Ibn \u02bfAbbas illustrates God as [[Anthropomorphization|anthropomorphed]] being who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn \u02bfAbbas's authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn \u2018Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn \u02bfAbbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn \u2018Abbas's Primitive Version.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\"/>\n\n==Modern Muslim observance==\nThe ''Lailat al-Mi\u02bfraj'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|ar|Lailatu 'l-Mi\u02bfr\u0101j}}), also known as ''Shab-e-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-bn|\u09b6\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ae\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u099c|\u0160obe Meraj}}, {{lang-fa|\u0634\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|fa|\u0160ab-e Mi'r\u00e2j}}) in Iran, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and ''Mira\u00e7 Kandili'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is the [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] celebrating the Isra and Mi\u02bfraj. Some Muslims celebrate this event by offering optional prayers during this night, and in some Muslim countries, by illuminating cities with electric lights and candles. The celebrations around this day tend to focus on every Muslim who wants to celebrate it. Worshippers gather into mosques and perform prayer and supplication. Some people may pass their knowledge on to others by telling them the story on how Muhammad's heart was purified by the [[Gabriel|archangel Gabriel]], who filled him with knowledge and faith in preparation to enter the seven levels of heaven. After [[salah]], food and treats are served.<ref name=times/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Religions \u2013 Islam: Lailat al Miraj|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0191/9101056.htm|title=WRMEA \u2013 Islam in America|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}</ref>\n\n[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to [[heaven]].

It is considered by some to have happened just over a year before the Hijrah, on the 27th of [[Rajab]]; but this date is not always recognized. This date would correspond to the [[Julian calendar|Julian date]] of 26 February 621, or, if from the previous year, 8 March 620. In [[Twelver]] [[Iran]] for example, Rajab 27 is the day of Muhammad's first calling or ''Mab'as''.
