But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers.  (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held.  The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\").  This is another All-India related festival.  The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month  of Savan (July/August).  This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year.  This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91).  Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers.  In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon.  The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system.  The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest. As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/> In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.' In \n the same manner as the king, after offering prayers to the Brahmins, the Brahmins, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and Shudras should conclude their Raksha Bandhan ceremony.\"<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137>\n{{citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/BhavishyaPuranaWithHindiTranslationPart3BaburamUpadhyaya20032/Bhavishya%20Purana%20with%20Hindi%20Translation%20Part%203%20-%20Baburam%20Upadhyaya%202003%20%282%29#page/n531|title=Bhavisha Mahapuranam with Hindi translation, Part 3|last = Upadhyay|first = Baburam (translator)|publisher=Hindi Sahitya Sammelan|location=Allahabad|year = 2003|pages=516\u2013518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Relation to territorial exogamy==\nOf special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village [[exogamy]]\u2014in which a bride marries ''out'' of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\" /> Anthropologist Leo Coleman writes: <blockquote>Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" /> Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote> The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.\n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular.

One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families.

Finally, saint Narada appears who persuades Ganesha that a daughter will enrich him as well as his sons. Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection).

He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.

But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers.  (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held.  The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\").  This is another All-India related festival.  The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month  of Savan (July/August).  This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year.  This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91).  Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers.  In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon.  The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system.  The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest.  As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/>  In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water.  He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased.  It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''.  That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.'

In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>  \n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" />  Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby,  sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil.  It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees.  Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy.  The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote>   The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.  \n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists.  The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular.

In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi'\u2014the thread that is used in the 'Raksha Bandhan'\u2014has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\"/></blockquote> \n\nSimilarly, according to author [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/> <blockquote> This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood),<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/></blockquote>   Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration\" /> as Leo Coleman states: <blockquote> ... as citizens become participants in the wider \"new traditions\" of the national state.  Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-nation-building\"/></blockquote>   \n\nMore recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, <blockquote> Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this [[Hindu_Succession_Act,_1956#In_the_case_of_females|Act]] through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Voluntary kin relations==\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Prasad Rakhi 1953.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first president of the [[Republic of India]] celebrating Raksha Bandhan at the presidential palace, [[Rashtrapati Bhawan]], in [[New Delhi]], 24 August 1953]]\nAmong women and men who are not [[Consanguinity|blood relative]]s, there is also a transformed tradition of [[fictive kinship|voluntary kin]] relations, achieved through the tying of ''rakhi'' amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines,<ref name=\"HeitzmanWorden1996\" /> and Hindu and Muslim divisions.<ref name=\"MinesLamb2002\" />  In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction.<ref name=\"Chowdhry1994\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, \"The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation.

He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.

She was the fourth of six children born into the artistic family of Justin Isidore (Eug\u00e8ne) Duchamp (1848-1925) and Marie Caroline Lucie (1860-1925).\n\nSuzanne Duchamp-Crotti was the younger sister of famous artists [[Jacques Villon]] n\u00e9e Gaston Duchamp, a painter and printmaker, [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], a sculptor, and [[Marcel Duchamp]], a painter, sculptor and author. She was closest in age and temperament to Marcel Duchamp, forming and maintaining a close bond and emotional attachment with him throughout their lives. Scholars, such as [[Arturo Schwarz]], have speculated that there may have been an incestuous relationship between the two, although that was influenced by Freudian school of thought at the time.\n\nShe began her studies as a painter at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in her native [[Rouen]] when she was sixteen years old in 1905. Her early works reflected styles ranging from [[Intimism (art movement)|Intimism]] and [[Fauvism]] to [[Impressionism]] and a conservative [[Cubism]], often depicting family and childhood scenes around Rouen. From 1909-1910, Marcel and Suzanne participated together in the activities of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de de Peinture Moderne, an artists' group based in Rouen. Through this group, she was exposed to avant-garde trends. At age 21, in 1911, she married a local pharmacist named Charles Desmares but quickly divorced, moving to [[Paris]] to serve as a nurse during the [[World War I|First World War]], living in Marcel's apartment in rue la Condamine. She worked in the [[Les Invalides|H\u00f4tel des Invalides]], one of the largest French military hospitals. During this time, she continued to work as an artist, establishing a presence in the Parisian quarter of [[Montparnasse]] and often asking Marcel for feedback or advice.\n\n== Early work ==\nIn late 1915, Suzanne went to clear out Marcel's studio in Paris and this is when/where she first learned about his readymades. Between 1916 and 1921 she produced a significant body of work in a formal language that has come to be called 'mechanomorphic' - images taken from commonplace mechanical or technological objects arranged to describe or infer human agency, desire or behavior. To work of [[Francis Picabia]] typifies the mechanomorphic tendency.<ref name=\"oxford\" /> In a letter from Marcel written in January 1916, Marcel elaborated on his concept of the ready-mades and mentioned the [[Bicycle Wheel]] and the [[Bottle Rack|Bottlerack]] which she should have encountered in the studio. He asked her to complete one of them by adding the inscription \"d'apr\u00e8s Marcel Duchamp,\" which translates to \"after Marcel Duchamp.\" This collaboration with Marcel exhibited his trust in Suzanne about her openness towards radical art production.\n\nIn 1916, Suzanne met Jean Crotti, an artist who worked in the same studio as Marcel. During this time is when her first surge of activity occurred, creating some of her best work. She produced \"Un et une menac\u00e9s,\" \"A Threatened Male and Female\" which references mechanical symbolism as well as real machine parts, which greatly lends itself to the Dadaist movement. One of her most noteworthy works is ''[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/134050 Multiplication Broken and Restored],'' completed in 1919. The composition contains Dadaist imagery with man-made objects such as a tower and cityscape. It is also believed that this piece comes directly from her private experience rather than being a severe critique of cultural norms.<ref name=\"Camfield\">{{Cite book|title=Tabu dada - Jean Crotti & Suzanne Duchamp, 1915-1922|last=Camfield|first=William A|last2=Crotti|first2=Jean|last3=Duchamp|first3=Suzanne|last4=Martin|first4=Jean-Hubert|last5=Kunsthalle (Bern)|date=1983-01-01|publisher=St\u00e4mpfli|location=Bern|oclc = 884080729|language=English}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, Suzanne and Jean married in Paris in 1919. As a wedding present, Marcel sent them instructions for a [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] which involved suspending a geometry textbook on the porch and letting the wind and rain gradually tear it apart.\n\nDuring this time, Dada was gaining traction in Paris due to figures like [[Tristan Tzara]]. Jean and Suzanne were not very involved until 21, but both exhibited three works in the prestigious [[Salon Des Independants|Salon des Ind\u00e8pendants]], alongside artists such as [[Francis Picabia]]. The art emphasized was that of the provocative mecanomorphic style. After this, Suzanne continued to work on her dadaist oeuvre, creating more delicate watercolor or gouache paintings. One of these paintings is \"Marcel's Unhappy Readymade,\" depicting the geometry textbook she received from him as a gift. Interestingly, Suzanne inverted the painting so that it was presented upside down.\n\nCompleted in 1920, her work ''[http://www.wikiart.org/en/suzanne-duchamp/ariette-d-oubli-de-la-chapelle-tourdie-1920 Ariette of Oblivion in the Thoughtless Chapel]'' is regarded as the strongest Dadaist work that she created with seemingly nonsense inscriptions and mechanical imagery. However, much like ''[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/134050 Multiplication Broken and Restored]'', the inspiration for this piece emerged from the devotion she experienced in her relationship. This personal perspective runs contrary to the Dada sentiment of criticizing social conventions and undermining culture.<ref name=\"Camfield\" />\n\nIn 1921, Jean and Suzanne sign the \"Dada soul\u00e9ve tout,\" a tract created to rebuke a secure given by the Italian Futurist, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]]. In April 1921, she exhibited with Crotti at the Tabu exhibition the Salon d'Autonme, (at the [[Galerie Montaigne]] in Paris); this was a few weeks before the Dada Salon at the same location.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dada movement, 1915-1923|last=Dachy|first=Marc|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Skira ; Rizzoli|isbn=0847811107|location=Geneva; New York|oclc = 20593701|language=English}}</ref> In later years, Duchamp and Crotti moved further away from Dada calling their work 'Tabu'. The Tabu pieces were more geometric and abstract, seeking certain universal tropes, but still reveal a highly personalized symbolic language. Tabu works drew on a range of domestic or everyday issues, simplified and combined in often striking ways. These works never brought the acclaim of Duchamp's earlier mechanomorphic pieces and are not discussed widely in literature on the artist.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n== Later life ==\nThroughout her life, Suzanne continues to participate in exhibitions, such as the \"Femmes Peintures Fran\u00e7ais\" exhibition at Galerie Barbazanges, organized by women artists wanting recognition in the art world. She also exhibited along with [[Marie Laurencin]] in \"Les Femmes Artistes d'Europe\" at the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume in 1937.\n\nIn 1945, after the war, Suzanne Duchamp becomes a member of the Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs and regularly exhibited landscapes, portraits, and flower still lifes at its salons.\n\nIn 1967, in [[Rouen]], France, her brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called ''Les Duchamp: [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], Suzanne Duchamp''. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] in [[Paris]].\n\nShe died in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] (Seine-Saint-Denis), France in 1963, within a month of being diagnosed with a brain tumor.\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n*Tomkins, Calvin, ''Duchamp: A Biography''.

One of her most noteworthy works is ''[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/134050 Multiplication Broken and Restored],'' completed in 1919. The composition contains Dadaist imagery with man-made objects such as a tower and cityscape. It is also believed that this piece comes directly from her private experience rather than being a severe critique of cultural norms.<ref name=\"Camfield\">{{Cite book|title=Tabu dada - Jean Crotti & Suzanne Duchamp, 1915-1922|last=Camfield|first=William A|last2=Crotti|first2=Jean|last3=Duchamp|first3=Suzanne|last4=Martin|first4=Jean-Hubert|last5=Kunsthalle (Bern)|date=1983-01-01|publisher=St\u00e4mpfli|location=Bern|oclc = 884080729|language=English}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, Suzanne and Jean married in Paris in 1919. As a wedding present, Marcel sent them instructions for a [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] which involved suspending a geometry textbook on the porch and letting the wind and rain gradually tear it apart.\n\nDuring this time, Dada was gaining traction in Paris due to figures like [[Tristan Tzara]]. Jean and Suzanne were not very involved until 21, but both exhibited three works in the prestigious [[Salon Des Independants|Salon des Ind\u00e8pendants]], alongside artists such as [[Francis Picabia]]. The art emphasized was that of the provocative mecanomorphic style. After this, Suzanne continued to work on her dadaist oeuvre, creating more delicate watercolor or gouache paintings. One of these paintings is \"Marcel's Unhappy Readymade,\" depicting the geometry textbook she received from him as a gift. Interestingly, Suzanne inverted the painting so that it was presented upside down.\n\nCompleted in 1920, her work ''[http://www.wikiart.org/en/suzanne-duchamp/ariette-d-oubli-de-la-chapelle-tourdie-1920 Ariette of Oblivion in the Thoughtless Chapel]'' is regarded as the strongest Dadaist work that she created with seemingly nonsense inscriptions and mechanical imagery. However, much like ''[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/134050 Multiplication Broken and Restored]'', the inspiration for this piece emerged from the devotion she experienced in her relationship. This personal perspective runs contrary to the Dada sentiment of criticizing social conventions and undermining culture.<ref name=\"Camfield\" />\n\nIn 1921, Jean and Suzanne sign the \"Dada soul\u00e9ve tout,\" a tract created to rebuke a secure given by the Italian Futurist, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]]. In April 1921, she exhibited with Crotti at the Tabu exhibition the Salon d'Autonme, (at the [[Galerie Montaigne]] in Paris); this was a few weeks before the Dada Salon at the same location.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dada movement, 1915-1923|last=Dachy|first=Marc|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Skira ; Rizzoli|isbn=0847811107|location=Geneva; New York|oclc = 20593701|language=English}}</ref> In later years, Duchamp and Crotti moved further away from Dada calling their work 'Tabu'. The Tabu pieces were more geometric and abstract, seeking certain universal tropes, but still reveal a highly personalized symbolic language. Tabu works drew on a range of domestic or everyday issues, simplified and combined in often striking ways. These works never brought the acclaim of Duchamp's earlier mechanomorphic pieces and are not discussed widely in literature on the artist.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n== Later life ==\nThroughout her life, Suzanne continues to participate in exhibitions, such as the \"Femmes Peintures Fran\u00e7ais\" exhibition at Galerie Barbazanges, organized by women artists wanting recognition in the art world. She also exhibited along with [[Marie Laurencin]] in \"Les Femmes Artistes d'Europe\" at the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume in 1937.\n\nIn 1945, after the war, Suzanne Duchamp becomes a member of the Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs and regularly exhibited landscapes, portraits, and flower still lifes at its salons.\n\nIn 1967, in [[Rouen]], France, her brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called ''Les Duchamp: [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], Suzanne Duchamp''. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] in [[Paris]].\n\nShe died in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] (Seine-Saint-Denis), France in 1963, within a month of being diagnosed with a brain tumor.\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n*Tomkins, Calvin, ''Duchamp: A Biography''.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br />(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br />(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20171226172141/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 7.] \"The name of Benjamin Banneker, the Afro-American self-taught mathematician and almanac-maker, occurs again and again in the several published accounts of the survey of Washington City begun in 1791, but with conflicting reports of the role which he played. Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126 Bedini, 1971, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote ''[[Tales of a Wayside Inn]]'', a book of poems published in 1863. In the book, the poem ''The Landlord's Tale'' was the source of the immortal phrase \"listen my children and you shall hear, of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.\" [[Henry Ford]] bought the inn in 1923, restored it and donated it to a charitable foundation which continues to run it as an operating inn to this day. Ford also built a boys' school on the property, as well as a grist mill, and the Martha\u2013Mary Chapel. He brought in the Redstone Schoolhouse from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], which was reputed to be the school in [[Sarah Josepha Hale]]'s [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''.<ref>{{ cite book |last=Roulstone |first=John |author2=Mary (Sawyer) |title=The Story of Mary's Little Lamb |publisher=Mr. & Mrs. Henry Ford |location=Dearborn |year=1928 |pages=8}}</ref><ref>\"About America's Oldest Inn,\" Longfellow's Wayside Inn Web site (http://www.wayside.org/about), Retrieved July 25, 2014.</ref> However, Giuseppi Cavicchio's refusal to sell his water rights scuttled [[Henry Ford]]'s plans to build an auto parts factory at the site of Charles O. Parmenter's mill in South Sudbury.<ref name=\"Garfield\" />\n\nIn August 1925, a Sudbury farm was the scene of a riot between local members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Irish-American]] youths from the area. Five people were wounded by gunshots, and the [[Massachusetts State Police|State Police]] arrested over 100 Klansmen. [[Massachusetts]] officials cracked down on the group's meetings thereafter, and the Klan died out in the area.<ref name=\"Garfield\">{{cite book|author=Garfield, Curtis F |title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989 100 Years in the Life of a Town |publisher=Porcupine Enterprises |year=1999 |isbn=0-9621976-3-7}}</ref>\n\nIn the period after World War II, Sudbury experienced rapid growth in population and industry. Defense contractor [[Raytheon]] was a major employer, operating a large research facility in Sudbury from 1958 until 2016. Another major employer in that period was [[Sperry Rand]]. In the 1970s, the town was home to many of the engineers working in the [[minicomputer]] revolution at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in nearby Maynard. Sudbury was also one of the largest carnation-growing towns, with many greenhouse operations.\n\nFrom 1960\u20131969, Sudbury challenged and prevailed against a proposal by [[Boston Edison Company]] which would have installed overhead transmission lines through what is now [[Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge]]. Ultimately, the line was instead buried under streets to Maynard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sudbury.ma.us/historicalinfoarticles/2001/04/09/sudbury-1890-1989-100-years-in-the-life-of-a-town-chapter-21/|title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989, 100 years in the Life of a Town (Chapter 21) \u00bb Informational \u2013 Historic Articles|website=sudbury.ma.us|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\nResidentially, Sudbury's {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} zoning bylaws helped the town maintain a more rural character through the 1970s and 1980s, when developments of single-family Colonials and large Capes established it as an affluent location. Commercial growth was restricted to the town's main thoroughfare, [[U.S. Route 20|US Route 20]]. Significant tracts of open space\u2014including much wetland\u2014were preserved in the northern half of town and along the Hop Brook corridor flowing from the [[Wayside Inn Historic District]] in the southwest part of town through the King Philip Historic District (the site of a conflict in [[King Philip's War]]) and into the [[Sudbury River]] at the southeast border with Wayland. A significant portion of the [[Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge]] (opened in 2005) is located in Sudbury.\n\nThe town's [[ZIP code]] of 01776 was specially assigned in recognition of the town's historical connections to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], according to the Sudbury Historical Society.

[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote ''[[Tales of a Wayside Inn]]'', a book of poems published in 1863. In the book, the poem ''The Landlord's Tale'' was the source of the immortal phrase \"listen my children and you shall hear, of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.\" [[Henry Ford]] bought the inn in 1923, restored it and donated it to a charitable foundation which continues to run it as an operating inn to this day. Ford also built a boys' school on the property, as well as a grist mill, and the Martha\u2013Mary Chapel. He brought in the Redstone Schoolhouse from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], which was reputed to be the school in [[Sarah Josepha Hale]]'s [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''.<ref>{{ cite book |last=Roulstone |first=John |author2=Mary (Sawyer) |title=The Story of Mary's Little Lamb |publisher=Mr. & Mrs. Henry Ford |location=Dearborn |year=1928 |pages=8}}</ref><ref>\"About America's Oldest Inn,\" Longfellow's Wayside Inn Web site (http://www.wayside.org/about), Retrieved July 25, 2014.</ref> However, Giuseppi Cavicchio's refusal to sell his water rights scuttled [[Henry Ford]]'s plans to build an auto parts factory at the site of Charles O. Parmenter's mill in South Sudbury.<ref name=\"Garfield\" />\n\nIn August 1925, a Sudbury farm was the scene of a riot between local members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Irish-American]] youths from the area. Five people were wounded by gunshots, and the [[Massachusetts State Police|State Police]] arrested over 100 Klansmen. [[Massachusetts]] officials cracked down on the group's meetings thereafter, and the Klan died out in the area.<ref name=\"Garfield\">{{cite book|author=Garfield, Curtis F |title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989 100 Years in the Life of a Town |publisher=Porcupine Enterprises |year=1999 |isbn=0-9621976-3-7}}</ref>\n\nIn the period after World War II, Sudbury experienced rapid growth in population and industry. Defense contractor [[Raytheon]] was a major employer, operating a large research facility in Sudbury from 1958 until 2016. Another major employer in that period was [[Sperry Rand]]. In the 1970s, the town was home to many of the engineers working in the [[minicomputer]] revolution at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in nearby Maynard. Sudbury was also one of the largest carnation-growing towns, with many greenhouse operations.\n\nFrom 1960\u20131969, Sudbury challenged and prevailed against a proposal by [[Boston Edison Company]] which would have installed overhead transmission lines through what is now [[Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge]]. Ultimately, the line was instead buried under streets to Maynard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sudbury.ma.us/historicalinfoarticles/2001/04/09/sudbury-1890-1989-100-years-in-the-life-of-a-town-chapter-21/|title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989, 100 years in the Life of a Town (Chapter 21) \u00bb Informational \u2013 Historic Articles|website=sudbury.ma.us|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\nResidentially, Sudbury's {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} zoning bylaws helped the town maintain a more rural character through the 1970s and 1980s, when developments of single-family Colonials and large Capes established it as an affluent location. Commercial growth was restricted to the town's main thoroughfare, [[U.S. Route 20|US Route 20]]. Significant tracts of open space\u2014including much wetland\u2014were preserved in the northern half of town and along the Hop Brook corridor flowing from the [[Wayside Inn Historic District]] in the southwest part of town through the King Philip Historic District (the site of a conflict in [[King Philip's War]]) and into the [[Sudbury River]] at the southeast border with Wayland. A significant portion of the [[Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge]] (opened in 2005) is located in Sudbury.\n\nThe town's [[ZIP code]] of 01776 was specially assigned in recognition of the town's historical connections to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], according to the Sudbury Historical Society.

The shared [[Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School]] (LSRHS) is located in Sudbury.\n\nThe high school's science program student team won the 2006 [[NOSB|National Ocean Sciences Bowl]] championship, and came in second in 2005. LSRHS has a nationally recognized{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} school newspaper and school yearbook, ''The Forum'' and ''DYAD'', respectively.\n\nThere are four elementary schools in Sudbury and one middle school.

This service is performed by the server in response to a [[protocol (computing)|service protocol]] request.\n\nAn example of a name server is the server component of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), one of the two principal [[namespace]]s of the [[Internet]]. The most important function of DNS servers is the translation (resolution) of human-memorable [[domain name]]s and [[hostname]]s into the corresponding numeric [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) addresses, the second principal name space of the Internet which is used to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet.\n\n==Domain Name Server==\n{{Main|Domain Name System}}\n\nThe Internet maintains two principal [[namespace]]s: the domain name hierarchy<ref name=\"rfc1034\">RFC 1034, ''Domain Names\u2014Concepts and Facilities'', P.

A DNS name server is a server that stores the [[Domain Name System|DNS records]], such as address (A, AAAA) records, name server (NS) records, and mail exchanger (MX) records for a domain name (see also [[List of DNS record types]]) and responds with answers to queries against its database.\n\n===Authoritative name server===\nAn authoritative name server is a name server that gives [[#Authoritative answer|answers]] in response to questions asked about names in a [[DNS zone|zone]].

A secondary server for a zone uses an automatic updating mechanism to maintain an identical copy of the primary server's database for a zone. Examples of such mechanisms include [[DNS zone transfer]]s and file transfer protocols. DNS provides a mechanism whereby the primary for a zone can notify all the known secondaries for that zone when the contents of the zone have changed.

In addition, many [[home networking|home-networking]] routers implement caching resolvers to improve efficiency in the local network.\nSome systems utilize <code>nscd</code> - the name service caching daemon<ref>, though this is typically not used for caching DNS names.\n{{cite book\n| last          = Nemeth\n| first         = Evi\n| authorlink    = Evi Nemeth\n| first2        = Garth\n| last2         = Snyder\n| first3        = Trent R.\n| last3         = Hein\n| title         = Linux administration handbook\n| url           = //books.google.com/books?id=GB_O89fnz_sC\n| accessdate    = 2012-02-14\n| edition       = 2\n| year          = 2006\n| publisher     = Addison-Wesley Professional\n| isbn          = 978-0-13-148004-9\n| page          = 504e\n| quote         = ncsd [.....] cache[s] the results of DNS lookups [...] but it also wraps the library routines that access information from the <code> passwd</code> and <code>group</code> files and their network database equivalents.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BIND]]\n* [[Comparison of DNS server software]]\n* [[Trojan.Win32.DNSChanger]]\n* [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]]\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]]\n* [[Network Information Service]]\n* [[Name Service Switch]] (NSS)\n* [[Resolver (DNS)|resolver]], [[resolv.conf]], [[resolvconf]] for [[Unix]]/[[Linux]]\n* [[Open Root Server Network]]\n* [[RealNames]]\n* [[List of managed DNS providers]]\n* [[Public recursive name servers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/a/free-public-dns-servers.htm Free and Public DNS Servers], article on ''about.com'' by Tim Fisher, retrieved on 2015-02-08 21-59 UTC\n* [http://www.bind9.net/ DNS & BIND Resources]\n\n[[Category:Internet Protocol based network software]]\n[[Category:Domain name system]]\n\n[[de:Domain Name System#Nameserver]]\n<s></s>\n", "name_user": "Arjuali", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDomain Name Server:India speed net", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server"}
