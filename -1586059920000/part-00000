Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|became the Solar System]]. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated [[nuclear fusion]] in its [[solar core|core]]. It is thought that almost all stars [[Star formation|form by this process]].\n\nThe Sun currently [[nuclear fusion|fuses]] about 600 million tons of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] every second, [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|converting 4 million tons of matter into energy]] every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When [[hydrogen fusion]] in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a [[red giant]]. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], and render [[Earth]] uninhabitable \u2013 but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a [[white dwarf]], and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.\n\nThe enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since [[prehistoric times]], and the Sun has been [[The Sun in culture|regarded by some cultures]] as a [[solar deity|deity]].

Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into [[thermal|thermal cells]] that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m<sup>3</sup> (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).<ref name=NASA1/>\n\nThe thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance  called the [[granule (solar physics)|solar granulation]] at the smallest scale and [[supergranulation]] at larger scales.

It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous.

Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the [[sky]], whose presence above the [[horizon]] creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a [[solar deity]] or other [[supernatural]] entity. [[Sun worship|Worship of the Sun]] was central to civilizations such as the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Inca]] of South America and the [[Aztec]]s of what is now [[Mexico]]. In religions such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone [[megalith]]s accurately mark the summer or winter [[solstice]] (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in [[Nabta Playa]], [[Egypt]]; [[Mnajdra]], [[Malta]] and at [[Stonehenge]], [[England]]); [[Newgrange]], a prehistoric human-built mount in [[Ireland]], was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] at [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] in [[Mexico]] is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the [[pyramid]] at the vernal and autumnal [[equinox]]es.\n\nThe Egyptians portrayed the god [[Ra]] as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was [[Helios]], carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of [[Elagabalus]] in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|late Roman Empire]] the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as [[Sol Invictus]] (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the [[fixed star]]s, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the [[ecliptic]] through the [[zodiac]], and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven [[classical planets|planets]] (Greek ''planetes'', \"wanderer\"); the naming of the [[Names of the days of the week|days of the weeks]] after the seven planets dates to the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]].<ref name=oed>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/planet |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Planet |accessdate=22 March 2015 |date=December 2007}}</ref><ref name=almagest>{{Cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the phenomena : the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=1997 |pages=1\u201312 |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/002182869702800101}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |author=Ptolemy |last2=Toomer |first2=G.J. |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-691-00260-6}}</ref>\n\n===Development of scientific understanding===\n\nIn the early first millennium BC, [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] observed that the Sun's motion along the [[ecliptic]] is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of [[Earth]] in an [[elliptic orbit]] around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]] and moving slower when it is farther away at [[Apsis|aphelion]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Babylon to Voyager and beyond: a history of planetary astronomy |first=David |last=Leverington |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-80840-8 |pages=6\u20137 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]].

It was adopted as the [[Sabbath]] day by Christians who did not have a Jewish background. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the [[winter solstice]] (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun ([[Sol Invictus]]).

Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|became the Solar System]]. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated [[nuclear fusion]] in its [[solar core|core]]. It is thought that almost all stars [[Star formation|form by this process]].\n\nThe Sun currently [[nuclear fusion|fuses]] about 600 million tons of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] every second, [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|converting 4 million tons of matter into energy]] every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When [[hydrogen fusion]] in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a [[red giant]]. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], and render [[Earth]] uninhabitable \u2013 but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a [[white dwarf]], and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.\n\nThe enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since [[prehistoric times]], and the Sun has been [[The Sun in culture|regarded by some cultures]] as a [[solar deity|deity]].

It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous.

This is the [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and [[thermal pulse]]s that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so.

Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the [[sky]], whose presence above the [[horizon]] creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a [[solar deity]] or other [[supernatural]] entity. [[Sun worship|Worship of the Sun]] was central to civilizations such as the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Inca]] of South America and the [[Aztec]]s of what is now [[Mexico]]. In religions such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone [[megalith]]s accurately mark the summer or winter [[solstice]] (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in [[Nabta Playa]], [[Egypt]]; [[Mnajdra]], [[Malta]] and at [[Stonehenge]], [[England]]); [[Newgrange]], a prehistoric human-built mount in [[Ireland]], was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] at [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] in [[Mexico]] is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the [[pyramid]] at the vernal and autumnal [[equinox]]es.\n\nThe Egyptians portrayed the god [[Ra]] as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was [[Helios]], carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of [[Elagabalus]] in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|late Roman Empire]] the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as [[Sol Invictus]] (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the [[fixed star]]s, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the [[ecliptic]] through the [[zodiac]], and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven [[classical planets|planets]] (Greek ''planetes'', \"wanderer\"); the naming of the [[Names of the days of the week|days of the weeks]] after the seven planets dates to the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]].<ref name=oed>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/planet |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Planet |accessdate=22 March 2015 |date=December 2007}}</ref><ref name=almagest>{{Cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the phenomena : the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=1997 |pages=1\u201312 |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/002182869702800101}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |author=Ptolemy |last2=Toomer |first2=G.J. |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-691-00260-6}}</ref>\n\n===Development of scientific understanding===\n\nIn the early first millennium BC, [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] observed that the Sun's motion along the [[ecliptic]] is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of [[Earth]] in an [[elliptic orbit]] around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]] and moving slower when it is farther away at [[Apsis|aphelion]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Babylon to Voyager and beyond: a history of planetary astronomy |first=David |last=Leverington |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-80840-8 |pages=6\u20137 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]].

The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the [[winter solstice]] (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun ([[Sol Invictus]]).

Egbert Gheeraerts was a painter who had moved from an unknown location to Bruges. Some scholars believe that Gheeraerts' [[patronymic]] indicates that he likely came from the Northern Netherlands. His wife Antonine, on the other hand, was a native of Bruges. Egbert became a master of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] of Bruges on 20 January 1516.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[File:Houghton Typ 530.67.124 - De Dene, 72.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''The flatterer's nature has an animal color'', from ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'', Bruges 1567]]\n\nThe exact date of birth of Marcus Gheeraerts is not known. On the basis of archival sources about the life of his father, it can be deduced that he was born between 1516 and 1521.<ref name=thyb/> Not long after her husband's death, Marcus' mother remarried Simon Pieters, who was also a painter and probably a native of the Northern Netherlands. The couple had six children with whom Marcus was raised.  This explains why he was sometimes referred to as Marcus Pieters. After the death of his stepfather Simon Pieters in early 1557, Marcus Gheeraerts became the guardian of his half-brothers and sisters. Marcus's mother died on 8 August 1580.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The lamentation of Christ.jpeg|thumb|260px|''The lamentation of Christ'']]\n\nThe master or masters of Marcus Gheeraerts are not known. The most obvious candidate is his stepfather Simon Pieters. Art historians believe that he started his training with Simon Pieters and later worked in the workshop of his guardian [[Albert Cornelis]]. It is speculated that he may have had other masters but there is no agreement as to their identity.  He likely trained outside Bruges to learn the craft of engraver, which was not generally practised at a high level in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThere is no information about Gheeraerts in the registers of the Sint-Lucas guild in Bruges for the period from 1522 to 1549.  This absence has been interpreted as an indication that he left his hometown to study in Antwerp or abroad. From 1558 onwards a number of documents demonstrate that Gheeraerts was resident in Bruges. On 31 July 1558, he entered the artisan and saddle maker's guild of Bruges as a master painter. In the same year, he was elected second board member of the guild, suggesting that he already enjoyed considerable professional recognition. From April to September 1561 Gheeraerts was the first board member.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nOn 3 June 1558, Marcus Gheeraerts married Johanna Struve. The couple had three children, of whom two are known by name, a son later referred to as Marcus the Younger and a daughter called Esther. A third child died at a young age and was buried in 1561.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nGheeraerts developed a professional career as a painter, etcher and designer. He was active as a designer of heraldic motifs. On 10 September 1559, he was commissioned to provide designs for the tombs of [[Mary of Burgundy]] and [[Charles the Bold]] in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges. He drew the patterns for the lavishly decorated metal ornaments, the colorful coats of arms and two copper angels that were attached to the sides of the tombs.  In 1561 Marcus Gheeraerts was commissioned to complete a triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter [[Bernard van Orley]]. The painting had remained unfinished after van Orley's death in 1542. Originally intended for the church of the monastery of Brou near Bourg-en-Bresse (Ain department, France), which Margaret of Austria had built, the triptych was transferred to Bruges after her death. Gheeraerts completed it.  [[Margaret of Parma]] later decided to place the triptych in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[Image:Marcus Gheeraerts I (Attr) - Composite rotting head of a monk representing an allegory of iconoclasm.jpg|left|thumb|230px|''Allegory of Iconoclasm''<ref>Although not particularly sympathetic to the Calvinist iconoclasts, it is mainly critical of the Catholic Church. The etching may have been the main reason why Gheeraerts had to flee to England in 1568. (British Museum, Dept. of Print and Drawings, 1933.1.1..3, see also Edward Hodnett: ''Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder'', Utrecht 1971, pp. 26-7)</ref>]]\n\nGheeraerts was further commissioned in 1561 to make a print depicting a map of his hometown. He completed the work in one year. The map is one of the earliest examples of a perspective city map that is correctly displayed.<ref name=thyb/>  It is during this period that Gheeraerts most likely painted the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] (collection of the Memling museum in Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges).<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts became involved in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] community in Bruges and became a leader of the local church community.  Whereas Calvinism was initially tolerated, the religious persecution of [[Calvinist]]s commenced in 1567 with the arrival of new governor of the Low Countries, the [[Duke of Alva]].  In 1566 he participated in protests against the arrest of Calvinists in Bruges. He reflected in his art on the religious turmoil and [[iconoclasm]] of his time.  As a Calvinist and artist he seemed to have had mixed feelings about the Iconoclasm of his religious group: he condemned idolatry of images but did not agree with the wholesale destruction of religious images by the Iconoclasts.  In 1566 or shortly after, he created a print referred to as the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' that shows a composite rotting head of a monk.  The head appears to rise up from a rocky outcropping. Myriad little figures swarm over the rocks. They enact 22 different scenes that used to be denoted by alphabetical keys which have not survived.<ref name=duke>Alastair Duke: Chapter ''Calvinists and 'papist idolatry': the mentality of the image-breakers in 1566'' in ''Dissident Identities in the Early Modern Low Countries'', Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2009, pp 196-197</ref>  Inside the gaping mouth a diabolical mass is celebrated. On the pate of the head sits a pope-like figure under a canopy on a throne surrounded by bishops and monks.

In the foreground Protestant iconoclasts are smashing altarpieces, religious sculptures, other church-related items and hurling them into a fire.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=1067484001&objectId=1429361&partId=1 Marcus Gheeraerts I (Attributed), ''Composite rotting head of a monk representing an allegory of iconoclasm''] in the British Museum</ref><ref name=green>David Freedberg, ''Art and iconoclasm, 1525-1580 The case of the Northern Netherlands'', J.P.

His wife and daughter remained in Bruges. The verdict in his case was pronounced at the end of 1568.  He was convicted and the punishment was permanent banishment and forfeiture of his entire fortune.\n\nGheeraerts took up residence in London upon his arrival in England in 1568. He was joined by his daughter in May 1571 likely after her mother had died.  After the death of his wife in Bruges, the artist married in England his second wife, Sussanah de Critz.  His wife was a sister of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I's]] [[serjeant-painter]], [[John de Critz]], another Flemish painter who had fled to England.The couple had two daughters and one son.  The only child surviving into adulthood, Sarah, later married the famous French-born English [[limner]] [[Isaac Oliver]].  Just as before in Bruges, Gheeraerts made drawings and etchings and continued his painting activities.  As there was a keen demand for portrait paintings in England, Gheeraerts started to paint portraits, which he had not done while still in Flanders.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nArt historians do not agree as to whether Gheeraerts returned to his native Flanders around 1577 to continue his career in [[Antwerp]].  In 1577 a 'Mercus Geeraert Painter' was registered as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp and paid registration fees for the years 1585 and 1586.  It is not clear whether this Mercus referred to Marcus the Elder or to Marcus the Younger. Some art historians believe that Marcus the Elder registered in the Antwerp Guild in order to be able to legally work with Antwerp printers for the publications on which he worked.  Others believe that he actually worked in Antwerp and point to the various publications printed in Antwerp on which he collaborated.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts had various pupils during his career. In 1563, 13-year-old Melchior d'Assoneville became an apprentice of Gheeraerts in Bruges. Melchior d\u2019Assoneville later became a sculptor and decorative painter and while living in [[Mechelen]] he was the master of Hendrik Faydherbe. His workshop assistant Philipus de la Valla who fled with him to England may also have been a pupil of Gheeraerts although he is sometimes referraed to in contemporary records as a servant.  It is not certain whether Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder was the teacher of his son Marcus the Younger. There are different views on this, but it is likely that he was but that his son also received training with other artists, who may have included other Flemish emigrants in England, such as [[Lucas de Heere]] and [[John de Critz]].\n \nThe date of death of Gheeraerts is not known but it must have been before 1599.<ref name=thyb/>\n\n==Work==\n===General===\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Procession of the Knights of the Garter (6).jpeg|thumb|330px|''Procession of the Knights of the Garter'']]\nGheeraerts was a painter, draughtsman, print designer, etcher and ornamemtal designer.  As many of his paintings were lost as a result of the Iconoclasm of the 16th century, he is now mainly known for his work as a printmaker and print designer. He was a keen innovator and experimented with [[etching]] at a time when [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] were dominant techniques. For example, his 1562 birds-eye view of the town of [[Bruges]] was etched on 10 different plates, and the resulting map measures 100 x 177&nbsp;cm.<ref name=map>[https://www.verrijkjekijkopbrugge.be/2017/12/08/de-koperplaten-van-de-kaart-van-marcus-gerards De koperplaten van de kaart van Marcus Gerards], 8 December 2017 {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n===Paintings===\nVery few paintings have been attributed to Gheeraerts with much certainty. He did not sign any of his paintings.  It is documented that he finished the triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter Bernard van Orley. The triptych was later damaged during the period of Iconoclasm and largely repainted in 1589 by [[Frans Pourbus the Younger]] during restoration work. It is not clear from the current state of the work, which parts were painted by which painter. It has been suggested that Bernard van Orley started the centre of the panel and that Marcus Gheeraerts completed the outer areas.

The inscription also mentions that Jacob Hoefnagel wanted the picture to depict all the fashions that could be seen in England.  Gheeraerts followed this instruction by depicting the figures in costumes from England, France, Venice and other European countries.  These costumes were based on a publication depicting various costumes compiled and illustrated by Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist Lucas de Heere.  It is believed both paintings depict marriage celebrations.  The location of the ''F\u00eate'' is the river bank of the Thames while the ''Festival'' is placed in an imaginary landscape.  In both paintings, a procession is moving from right to left headed by two men carrying large oval cakes, two violinists and a man bearing a vase with rosemary tied with ribbons.  The faces of the figures are rendered with precision and are likely portraits of members of the Flemish community in England. The paintings may have been intended to showcase the dignity and piety of the Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 community in England and to assert their proper place in their adopted country.  It is believed that the man looking at the viewer appearing in both paintings is a self-portrait of the artist Gheeraerts.<ref name=dek>Remy Debes, ''Dignity: A History'', Oxford University Press, 2017, pp. 179\u2013180</ref>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The unfortunate painter and his family.jpg|thumb|300px|''The unfortunate painter and his family'']]\n\n[[Karel van Mander]] wrote in his ''Schilderboeck'' from 1604 that Gheeraerts was a good [[landscape painter]], who \"often had the habit of including a [[Squatting position|squatting]], urinating woman on a bridge or elsewhere.\"<ref name=Mander /> A similar detail is seen in one of his fable illustrations and his map of Bruges.

The best-known print works he created before he left for England are the map of Bruges, the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' (both discussed above) and the [[Emblem book|emblematic]] [[fable]] book ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'' (''The true fables of the animals'').<ref name=thyb/><ref name=Mander>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0238.htm Marcus Geerarts biography] in ''Schilder-boeck'' (1604) by [[Karel van Mander]]</ref>\n\n====De warachtighe fabulen der dieren====\n[[File:Gheeraerts satyr.jpg|thumb|260px|''The satyr and the peasant'', from ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'']]\n\nThis book was published in 1567 in Bruges by Pieter de Clerck. Marcus Gheeraerts etched the title page and the 107 illustrations for each fable that his friend, Edewaerd de Dene, had written in his local [[Dutch language|Flemish]] verse. Gheeraerts initiated and financed the publication, which was printed to the highest standards of its time as a luxurious object with three different fonts.  Each fable takes up two facing pages: on the left-hand side the illustration is displayed headed with a proverb or saying and some verse underneath it while on the right-hand the fable and its moral are told. It was the first emblematic [[fable]] book and set a trend for similar books.\n\nThe principal source of the text in the book were ''Les fables du tr\u00e8s ancien \u00c9sope'' written by the French humanist Gilles Corrozet and published in Paris in 1542.  A second source was the ''Aesopi Phrygis et aliorum fabulae'', a collection of fables in Latin that was published on the Antwerp printing presses of [[Christophe Plantin]] in various editions from 1660. A third source for the fables writings of natural history such as ''Der Naturen Bloeme'' (The Flower (i.e. choice) of Nature), a Middle Dutch natural history encyclopedia, written in the thirteenth century by the Flemish writer [[Jacob van Maerlant]] and the Dutch-language natural history compilation ''Der Dieren Palleys'' (The palace of the Animals), published in Antwerp in 1520.  A final source for the fables are contemporary emblemata books such as the ''Emblemata'' of [[Andrea Alciato]] and an emblem of [[J\u00e1nos Zs\u00e1mboky|Joannes Sambucus]].<ref name=source>D.

Egbert Gheeraerts was a painter who had moved from an unknown location to Bruges. Some scholars believe that Gheeraerts' [[patronymic]] indicates that he likely came from the Northern Netherlands. His wife Antonine, on the other hand, was a native of Bruges. Egbert became a master of the [[Guild of Saint Luke]] of Bruges on 20 January 1516.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[File:Houghton Typ 530.67.124 - De Dene, 72.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''The flatterer's nature has an animal color'', from ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'', Bruges 1567]]\n\nThe exact date of birth of Marcus Gheeraerts is not known. On the basis of archival sources about the life of his father, it can be deduced that he was born between 1516 and 1521.<ref name=thyb/> Not long after her husband's death, Marcus' mother remarried Simon Pieters, who was also a painter and probably a native of the Northern Netherlands. The couple had six children with whom Marcus was raised.  This explains why he was sometimes referred to as Marcus Pieters. After the death of his stepfather Simon Pieters in early 1557, Marcus Gheeraerts became the guardian of his half-brothers and sisters. Marcus's mother died on 8 August 1580.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The lamentation of Christ.jpeg|thumb|260px|''The lamentation of Christ'']]\n\nThe master or masters of Marcus Gheeraerts are not known. The most obvious candidate is his stepfather Simon Pieters. Art historians believe that he started his training with Simon Pieters and later worked in the workshop of his guardian [[Albert Cornelis]]. It is speculated that he may have had other masters but there is no agreement as to their identity.  He likely trained outside Bruges to learn the craft of engraver, which was not generally practised at a high level in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThere is no information about Gheeraerts in the registers of the Sint-Lucas guild in Bruges for the period from 1522 to 1549.  This absence has been interpreted as an indication that he left his hometown to study in Antwerp or abroad. From 1558 onwards a number of documents demonstrate that Gheeraerts was resident in Bruges. On 31 July 1558, he entered the artisan and saddle maker's guild of Bruges as a master painter. In the same year, he was elected second board member of the guild, suggesting that he already enjoyed considerable professional recognition. From April to September 1561 Gheeraerts was the first board member.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nOn 3 June 1558, Marcus Gheeraerts married Johanna Struve. The couple had three children, of whom two are known by name, a son later referred to as Marcus the Younger and a daughter called Esther. A third child died at a young age and was buried in 1561.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nGheeraerts developed a professional career as a painter, etcher and designer. He was active as a designer of heraldic motifs. On 10 September 1559, he was commissioned to provide designs for the tombs of [[Mary of Burgundy]] and [[Charles the Bold]] in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges. He drew the patterns for the lavishly decorated metal ornaments, the colorful coats of arms and two copper angels that were attached to the sides of the tombs.  In 1561 Marcus Gheeraerts was commissioned to complete a triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter [[Bernard van Orley]]. The painting had remained unfinished after van Orley's death in 1542. Originally intended for the church of the monastery of Brou near Bourg-en-Bresse (Ain department, France), which Margaret of Austria had built, the triptych was transferred to Bruges after her death. Gheeraerts completed it.  [[Margaret of Parma]] later decided to place the triptych in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n[[Image:Marcus Gheeraerts I (Attr) - Composite rotting head of a monk representing an allegory of iconoclasm.jpg|left|thumb|230px|''Allegory of Iconoclasm''<ref>Although not particularly sympathetic to the Calvinist iconoclasts, it is mainly critical of the Catholic Church.

He completed the work in one year. The map is one of the earliest examples of a perspective city map that is correctly displayed.<ref name=thyb/>  It is during this period that Gheeraerts most likely painted the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] (collection of the Memling museum in Old St. John's Hospital in Bruges).<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts became involved in the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] community in Bruges and became a leader of the local church community.  Whereas Calvinism was initially tolerated, the religious persecution of [[Calvinist]]s commenced in 1567 with the arrival of new governor of the Low Countries, the [[Duke of Alva]].  In 1566 he participated in protests against the arrest of Calvinists in Bruges. He reflected in his art on the religious turmoil and [[iconoclasm]] of his time.  As a Calvinist and artist he seemed to have had mixed feelings about the Iconoclasm of his religious group: he condemned idolatry of images but did not agree with the wholesale destruction of religious images by the Iconoclasts.  In 1566 or shortly after, he created a print referred to as the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' that shows a composite rotting head of a monk.  The head appears to rise up from a rocky outcropping. Myriad little figures swarm over the rocks. They enact 22 different scenes that used to be denoted by alphabetical keys which have not survived.<ref name=duke>Alastair Duke: Chapter ''Calvinists and 'papist idolatry': the mentality of the image-breakers in 1566'' in ''Dissident Identities in the Early Modern Low Countries'', Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2009, pp 196-197</ref>  Inside the gaping mouth a diabolical mass is celebrated. On the pate of the head sits a pope-like figure under a canopy on a throne surrounded by bishops and monks.

His wife and daughter remained in Bruges. The verdict in his case was pronounced at the end of 1568.  He was convicted and the punishment was permanent banishment and forfeiture of his entire fortune.\n\nGheeraerts took up residence in London upon his arrival in England in 1568. He was joined by his daughter in May 1571 likely after her mother had died.  After the death of his wife in Bruges, the artist married in England his second wife, Sussanah de Critz.  His wife was a sister of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I's]] [[serjeant-painter]], [[John de Critz]], another Flemish painter who had fled to England.The couple had two daughters and one son.  The only child surviving into adulthood, Sarah, later married the famous French-born English [[limner]] [[Isaac Oliver]].  Just as before in Bruges, Gheeraerts made drawings and etchings and continued his painting activities.  As there was a keen demand for portrait paintings in England, Gheeraerts started to paint portraits, which he had not done while still in Flanders.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nArt historians do not agree as to whether Gheeraerts returned to his native Flanders around 1577 to continue his career in [[Antwerp]].  In 1577 a 'Mercus Geeraert Painter' was registered as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp and paid registration fees for the years 1585 and 1586.  It is not clear whether this Mercus referred to Marcus the Elder or to Marcus the Younger. Some art historians believe that Marcus the Elder registered in the Antwerp Guild in order to be able to legally work with Antwerp printers for the publications on which he worked.  Others believe that he actually worked in Antwerp and point to the various publications printed in Antwerp on which he collaborated.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nMarcus Gheeraerts had various pupils during his career. In 1563, 13-year-old Melchior d'Assoneville became an apprentice of Gheeraerts in Bruges. Melchior d\u2019Assoneville later became a sculptor and decorative painter and while living in [[Mechelen]] he was the master of Hendrik Faydherbe. His workshop assistant Philipus de la Valla who fled with him to England may also have been a pupil of Gheeraerts although he is sometimes referraed to in contemporary records as a servant.  It is not certain whether Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder was the teacher of his son Marcus the Younger. There are different views on this, but it is likely that he was but that his son also received training with other artists, who may have included other Flemish emigrants in England, such as [[Lucas de Heere]] and [[John de Critz]].\n \nThe date of death of Gheeraerts is not known but it must have been before 1599.<ref name=thyb/>\n\n==Work==\n===General===\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Procession of the Knights of the Garter (6).jpeg|thumb|330px|''Procession of the Knights of the Garter'']]\nGheeraerts was a painter, draughtsman, print designer, etcher and ornamemtal designer.  As many of his paintings were lost as a result of the Iconoclasm of the 16th century, he is now mainly known for his work as a printmaker and print designer. He was a keen innovator and experimented with [[etching]] at a time when [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] were dominant techniques. For example, his 1562 birds-eye view of the town of [[Bruges]] was etched on 10 different plates, and the resulting map measures 100 x 177&nbsp;cm.<ref name=map>[https://www.verrijkjekijkopbrugge.be/2017/12/08/de-koperplaten-van-de-kaart-van-marcus-gerards De koperplaten van de kaart van Marcus Gerards], 8 December 2017 {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n===Paintings===\nVery few paintings have been attributed to Gheeraerts with much certainty. He did not sign any of his paintings.  It is documented that he finished the triptych of the Passion of Christ that had been commenced by the prominent painter Bernard van Orley. The triptych was later damaged during the period of Iconoclasm and largely repainted in 1589 by [[Frans Pourbus the Younger]] during restoration work. It is not clear from the current state of the work, which parts were painted by which painter. It has been suggested that Bernard van Orley started the centre of the panel and that Marcus Gheeraerts completed the outer areas.

The traditional attribution to Gheeraerts of the [[:File:Elizabeth I of England Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder.jpg|''Portrait of Elizabeth I of England'']], also referred to as the ''Peace portrait'' is still a matter of contention. The monogram \u201cM.G.F.\u201d on the portrait can apply to both Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder and his son Marcus the Younger. Some art historians regard it as a collaboration of father and son Gheeraerts.

The inscription also mentions that Jacob Hoefnagel wanted the picture to depict all the fashions that could be seen in England.  Gheeraerts followed this instruction by depicting the figures in costumes from England, France, Venice and other European countries.  These costumes were based on a publication depicting various costumes compiled and illustrated by Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist Lucas de Heere.  It is believed both paintings depict marriage celebrations.  The location of the ''F\u00eate'' is the river bank of the Thames while the ''Festival'' is placed in an imaginary landscape.  In both paintings, a procession is moving from right to left headed by two men carrying large oval cakes, two violinists and a man bearing a vase with rosemary tied with ribbons.  The faces of the figures are rendered with precision and are likely portraits of members of the Flemish community in England. The paintings may have been intended to showcase the dignity and piety of the Flemish \u00e9migr\u00e9 community in England and to assert their proper place in their adopted country.  It is believed that the man looking at the viewer appearing in both paintings is a self-portrait of the artist Gheeraerts.<ref name=dek>Remy Debes, ''Dignity: A History'', Oxford University Press, 2017, pp. 179\u2013180</ref>\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - The unfortunate painter and his family.jpg|thumb|300px|''The unfortunate painter and his family'']]\n\n[[Karel van Mander]] wrote in his ''Schilderboeck'' from 1604 that Gheeraerts was a good [[landscape painter]], who \"often had the habit of including a [[Squatting position|squatting]], urinating woman on a bridge or elsewhere.\"<ref name=Mander /> A similar detail is seen in one of his fable illustrations and his map of Bruges.  No landscape paintings by Gheeraerts' hand are currently attributed to him but some of his works such as the ''F\u00eate'', the ''Festival'' and the [[:File:Marcus Gheeraerts I - Triumphant Christ.jpg|''Triumphant Christ'']] contain important landscape elements.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThe description of the art collection of Cornelis van Hooghendorp made at the end of the 16th century included five paintings by Gheeraerts. These included a landscape with cows, an allegorical representation with a \"scene of the night when the devil sowed bad seed\", a representation of ''Mary on the flight to Egypt'' and two paintings on parchment. In 1563 Marcus Gheeraerts also painted a triptych for the church of the friars minor recollect in Bruges.<ref name=thyb/>\n\nThe painting style of Gheeraerts was initially influenced by Bernard van Orley. After 1565 he followed the Italianate style of painting of prominent Antwerp history painter [[Maerten de Vos]]. His painting style is further close to that of the little-known [[Vincent Sellaer]].<ref name=ham/>\n\n===Prints===\nGheeraerts was active as a printmaker and print designer during his time in Flanders and in England. The best-known print works he created before he left for England are the map of Bruges, the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' (both discussed above) and the [[Emblem book|emblematic]] [[fable]] book ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'' (''The true fables of the animals'').<ref name=thyb/><ref name=Mander>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0238.htm Marcus Geerarts biography] in ''Schilder-boeck'' (1604) by [[Karel van Mander]]</ref>\n\n====De warachtighe fabulen der dieren====\n[[File:Gheeraerts satyr.jpg|thumb|260px|''The satyr and the peasant'', from ''De warachtighe fabulen der dieren'']]\n\nThis book was published in 1567 in Bruges by Pieter de Clerck. Marcus Gheeraerts etched the title page and the 107 illustrations for each fable that his friend, Edewaerd de Dene, had written in his local [[Dutch language|Flemish]] verse. Gheeraerts initiated and financed the publication, which was printed to the highest standards of its time as a luxurious object with three different fonts.  Each fable takes up two facing pages: on the left-hand side the illustration is displayed headed with a proverb or saying and some verse underneath it while on the right-hand the fable and its moral are told. It was the first emblematic [[fable]] book and set a trend for similar books.\n\nThe principal source of the text in the book were ''Les fables du tr\u00e8s ancien \u00c9sope'' written by the French humanist Gilles Corrozet and published in Paris in 1542.  A second source was the ''Aesopi Phrygis et aliorum fabulae'', a collection of fables in Latin that was published on the Antwerp printing presses of [[Christophe Plantin]] in various editions from 1660. A third source for the fables writings of natural history such as ''Der Naturen Bloeme'' (The Flower (i.e. choice) of Nature), a Middle Dutch natural history encyclopedia, written in the thirteenth century by the Flemish writer [[Jacob van Maerlant]] and the Dutch-language natural history compilation ''Der Dieren Palleys'' (The palace of the Animals), published in Antwerp in 1520.  A final source for the fables are contemporary emblemata books such as the ''Emblemata'' of [[Andrea Alciato]] and an emblem of [[J\u00e1nos Zs\u00e1mboky|Joannes Sambucus]].<ref name=source>D.

About 30 images were Gheeraerts' own invention.<ref name=hod>Edward Hodnett, ''Francis Barlow: First Master of English Book Illustration'', 1978, University of California Press, pp. 67-71</ref>\n\nGheeraerts added another 18 illustrations and a new title page for a French version of the ''Fabulen'' that was published in 1578 under the title ''Esbatement moral des animaux''.<ref>[http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/european/2015/10/the-esbatement-moral-des-animaux.html Ir\u00e8ne Fabry-Tehranchi, ''The \u2018Esbatement moral des animaux\u2019 : a 16th century French adaption of Aesopian fables and their illustration'']</ref> A Latin version, ''Mythologia ethica'', was published in the following year with a title page likely based on a drawing by Gheeraerts. The copper plates were used in books well into the 18th Century and the fable series was copied by artists all over Europe. Gheeraerts also etched a second series of 65 illustrations for the fable book ''[[Dialogus creaturarum|Apologi Creaturarum]]'', which was published in Antwerp in 1584. However, the etchings were smaller than those of the first series and this book never achieved the same popularity as the original one.<ref name=source/>  Gheeraerts' images were also used in publications until the 18th century in the Dutch Republic, Germany, France and Bohemia.<ref name=hod/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Reference books==\n*Reginald Lane Poole (Mrs.): ''Marcus Gheeraerts, Father and Son, Painters'', The Walpole Society, 3 (1914), 1\u20138.\n*Arthur Ewart Popham: ''The etchings of Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder'', Print Collector's Quarterly, 15 (1928), 187\u2013200.\n*Albert Schouteet, ''De zestiende-eeuwsche schilder en graveur Marcus Gerards'', Bruges, Druk.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Ztyler460", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed word choice", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}

The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like [[neutron]]s and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer [[de Broglie wavelength]] for a given energy.\n\nElectrons play an essential role in numerous [[physics|physical]] phenomena, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[chemistry]] and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitational wave|gravitational]], [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].<ref name=\"anastopoulos1\" /> Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding [[electric field]], and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to generate a [[magnetic field]]. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the [[Lorentz force law]]. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of [[photon]]s when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as [[electronics]], [[Electron beam welding|welding]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[electron microscope]]s, [[radiation therapy]], [[Free-electron laser|lasers]], [[gaseous ionization detectors]] and [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\nInteractions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] interaction between the positive [[proton]]s within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as [[atom]]s. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the [[binding energy]] of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of [[chemical bond]]ing.<ref name=Pauling/> In 1838, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of atoms.<ref name=\"arabatzis\"/> Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and [[J. J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.<ref name=\"thomson\"/>  Electrons can also participate in [[nuclear reaction]]s, such as [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis in stars]], where they are known as [[beta particle]]s. Electrons can be created through [[beta decay]] of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and in high-energy collisions, for instance when [[cosmic ray]]s enter the atmosphere.  The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the [[positron]]; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other [[charge (physics)|charges]] of the opposite sign. When an [[Electron\u2013positron annihilation|electron collides with a positron]], both particles can be [[annihilation|annihilated]], producing [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory|label 1=History of electromagnetism}}\n\n===Discovery of effect of electric force===\nThe [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greeks]] noticed that [[amber]] attracted small objects when rubbed with fur.

In 1869, Plucker's student [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] found that a solid body placed in between the cathode and the phosphorescence would cast a shadow upon the phosphorescent region of the tube.  Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls.  In 1876, the German physicist [[Eugen Goldstein]] showed that the rays were emitted perpendicular to the cathode surface, which distinguished between the rays that were emitted from the cathode and the incandescent light.  Goldstein dubbed the rays [[cathode ray]]s.<ref name=Whittaker>{{citation|last=Whittaker|first= E. T.|title=A history of the theories of aether and electricity.

In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} \u2212''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>)}}, where the variables ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively.

[[Boson]]s, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.<ref name=\"munowitz\"/>{{rp|162\u2013218}}\n\nIn the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a [[zero probability]] that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons.

Being [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can occupy the same [[quantum state]], in accordance with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].<ref name=\"curtis74\"/> Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of [[wave-particle duality|both particles and waves]]: they can collide with other particles and can be [[electron diffraction|diffracted]] like light. The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like [[neutron]]s and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer [[de Broglie wavelength]] for a given energy.\n\nElectrons play an essential role in numerous [[physics|physical]] phenomena, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[chemistry]] and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitational wave|gravitational]], [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].<ref name=\"anastopoulos1\" /> Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding [[electric field]], and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to generate a [[magnetic field]]. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the [[Lorentz force law]]. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of [[photon]]s when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as [[electronics]], [[Electron beam welding|welding]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[electron microscope]]s, [[radiation therapy]], [[Free-electron laser|lasers]], [[gaseous ionization detectors]] and [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\nInteractions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] interaction between the positive [[proton]]s within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as [[atom]]s. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the [[binding energy]] of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of [[chemical bond]]ing.<ref name=Pauling/> In 1838, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of atoms.<ref name=\"arabatzis\"/> Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and [[J. J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.<ref name=\"thomson\"/>  Electrons can also participate in [[nuclear reaction]]s, such as [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis in stars]], where they are known as [[beta particle]]s. Electrons can be created through [[beta decay]] of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and in high-energy collisions, for instance when [[cosmic ray]]s enter the atmosphere.  The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the [[positron]]; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other [[charge (physics)|charges]] of the opposite sign. When an [[Electron\u2013positron annihilation|electron collides with a positron]], both particles can be [[annihilation|annihilated]], producing [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory|label 1=History of electromagnetism}}\n\n===Discovery of effect of electric force===\nThe [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greeks]] noticed that [[amber]] attracted small objects when rubbed with fur.

In 1869, Plucker's student [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] found that a solid body placed in between the cathode and the phosphorescence would cast a shadow upon the phosphorescent region of the tube.  Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls.  In 1876, the German physicist [[Eugen Goldstein]] showed that the rays were emitted perpendicular to the cathode surface, which distinguished between the rays that were emitted from the cathode and the incandescent light.  Goldstein dubbed the rays [[cathode ray]]s.<ref name=Whittaker>{{citation|last=Whittaker|first= E. T.|title=A history of the theories of aether and electricity.

In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} \u2212''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>)}}, where the variables ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively.

[[Boson]]s, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.<ref name=\"munowitz\"/>{{rp|162\u2013218}}\n\nIn the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a [[zero probability]] that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons.

The [[source code]] of these commercially developed and distributed [[video game]]s is available to the public or the games' communities.\n\n== Motivation ==\nCommercial video games are typically developed as [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[closed source]] [[software product]]s, with the source code treated as a [[trade secret]] (unlike [[open-source video game]]s). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming [[abandonware|abandoned]].\n\n== Description ==\nIn several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) [[software license]]s to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. [[SourceForge]] or [[GitHub]]), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an [[interpreted language]] such as [[BASIC]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and distributed as raw source code without being [[Compiler|compiled]]; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. In some cases when a game's source code is not available by other means, the game's community \"reconstructs\" source code from compiled [[binary file]]s through time-demanding [[reverse engineering]] techniques. \nSource code availability in whatever form allows the games' communities to study how the game works, make modifications, and provide technical support themselves when the official support has ended, e.g. with [[unofficial patch]]es to fix bugs or [[source port]]s to make the game compatible with new [[Computing platform|platforms]].\n\n== Games with instantly included source code ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!First release\n!Source code release\n!Genre\n!Engine license\n!Content license\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[A Dark Room]]''\n|2013\n|2013\n|[[Online text-based role-playing game]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|Doublespeak Games\n|In July 2013 the [[source code]] of the game was put on [[GitHub]] under [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]] 2.0.<ref>[http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ A Dark Room goes open source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907210142/http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ |date=2015-09-07 }} on doublespeakgames.com (July 3, 2013)</ref> Became commercially successful after the source code release.\n|-\n|''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom]]''\n|1979\n|1979\n|[[Role-playing video game]]\n|public domain\n|Freeware\n|[[Richard Garriott]]\n|[[Richard Garriott]] distributed the [[Applesoft BASIC]] written game originally as source code.

Techniques used to accomplish this are [[Decompiler|decompiling]], [[Disassembler|disassembling]], and [[reverse engineering]] the binary [[executable]]. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but rather a divergent version, as a binary program does not contain all of the information originally carried in the source code. For example, comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional [[Debugging|debug]] information.\n\nUsing the techniques listed above within a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|\"bottom-up\" development methodology]] process, the re-created source-code of a game is able to replicate the behavior of the original game exactly, often being \"clock-cycle accurate\", and/or \"pixel-per-pixel accurate\".  This approach is in contrast to that used by [[game engine recreation]]s, which are often made using a \"top-down\" development methodology, and which can result in duplicating the general features provided by a [[game engine]], but not necessarily an accurate representation of the original game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!Original release\n!Source code reconstructed\n!Genre\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[Albion (video game)|Albion]]''\n|1996\n|2011\n|[[Adventure game]]\n|[[Blue Byte]]\n|In 2011 via [[static recompilation]] from the original [[x86]] binary executable a port for the [[ARM architecture]] of the [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] [[handheld]] was created by fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |title=Albion |date=2011-11-06 |author=M-HT |accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=openpandora.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071307/http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |publisher=repo.openpandora.org |quote=''This is a port of the game's executable for Pandora (using static recompilation/binary translation).'' |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331042620/http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |archivedate=2014-03-31 }}</ref> The community still updates this recompiled version and released also Windows and Linux builds in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/page-4#entry375940 |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-24 |publisher=boards.openpandora.org |quote=''Here is a version for Windows, in case anyone is interested.

The [[source code]] of these commercially developed and distributed [[video game]]s is available to the public or the games' communities.\n\n== Motivation ==\nCommercial video games are typically developed as [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[closed source]] [[software product]]s, with the source code treated as a [[trade secret]] (unlike [[open-source video game]]s). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming [[abandonware|abandoned]].\n\n== Description ==\nIn several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) [[software license]]s to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. [[SourceForge]] or [[GitHub]]), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an [[interpreted language]] such as [[BASIC]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and distributed as raw source code without being [[Compiler|compiled]]; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''.

Techniques used to accomplish this are [[Decompiler|decompiling]], [[Disassembler|disassembling]], and [[reverse engineering]] the binary [[executable]]. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but rather a divergent version, as a binary program does not contain all of the information originally carried in the source code. For example, comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional [[Debugging|debug]] information.\n\nUsing the techniques listed above within a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|\"bottom-up\" development methodology]] process, the re-created source-code of a game is able to replicate the behavior of the original game exactly, often being \"clock-cycle accurate\", and/or \"pixel-per-pixel accurate\".  This approach is in contrast to that used by [[game engine recreation]]s, which are often made using a \"top-down\" development methodology, and which can result in duplicating the general features provided by a [[game engine]], but not necessarily an accurate representation of the original game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!Original release\n!Source code reconstructed\n!Genre\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[Albion (video game)|Albion]]''\n|1996\n|2011\n|[[Adventure game]]\n|[[Blue Byte]]\n|In 2011 via [[static recompilation]] from the original [[x86]] binary executable a port for the [[ARM architecture]] of the [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] [[handheld]] was created by fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |title=Albion |date=2011-11-06 |author=M-HT |accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=openpandora.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071307/http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |publisher=repo.openpandora.org |quote=''This is a port of the game's executable for Pandora (using static recompilation/binary translation).'' |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331042620/http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |archivedate=2014-03-31 }}</ref> The community still updates this recompiled version and released also Windows and Linux builds in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/page-4#entry375940 |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-24 |publisher=boards.openpandora.org |quote=''Here is a version for Windows, in case anyone is interested.
