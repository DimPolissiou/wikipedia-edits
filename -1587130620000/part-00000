Seven Baltimore  classes:\n\n{{Baltimore groups}}\n\n[[File:The Baltimore Classification.gif|center|thumb|800px|Visualization of the seven groups of virus according to the Baltimore Classification]]\n\n===Group I: Double-stranded DNA viruses===\n\n{{Main|dsDNA virus}}\n\nThese types of viruses must enter the host [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] before they are able to replicate. Furthermore, these viruses require host cell [[DNA polymerase|polymerases]] to replicate the viral [[genome]] and, hence, are highly dependent on the [[cell cycle]]. Proper infection and production of progeny requires that the cell be in replication, as it is during replication that the cell's polymerases are active. The virus may induce the cell to forcefully undergo [[cell division]], which may lead to [[cell transformation|transformation]] of the cell and, ultimately, [[cancer]]. Examples include [[Herpesviridae]], [[Adenoviridae]], and [[Papovaviridae]].\n\nThere is only one well-studied example in which a class 1 virus is not replicating within the nucleus: the [[Poxvirus]] family, a highly pathogenic virus that infects [[vertebrate]]s and includes the [[smallpox]] virus.\n\nThe mRNA is transcribed regularly from viral DNA using the host's RNA polymerase II. This produces two types of mRNA's:\n1) early mRNA, transcribed prior to the synthesis of viral DNA, and\n2) late mRNA, transcribed from progeny DNA.\n\n===Group II: Single-stranded DNA viruses===\n{{Main|ssDNA virus}}\nViruses in this category include the [[Anelloviridae]], [[Circoviridae]], and [[Parvoviridae]] (which infect vertebrates), the [[Geminiviridae]] and [[Nanoviridae]] (which infect plants), and the [[Microviridae]] (which infect [[prokaryotes]]). Most of them have circular genomes (the parvoviruses are the only known exception). Eukaryote-infecting viruses replicate mostly within the nucleus - usually via a [[Rolling_circle_replication|rolling circle mechanism]], forming double-stranded DNA intermediate in the process. A prevalent but [[asymptomatic]] human Anellovirus, called [[Transfusion Transmitted Virus]] (TTV), is included within this classification.\n\n===Group III: Double-stranded RNA viruses===\n{{Main|dsRNA virus}}\nAs with most [[RNA]] viruses, this class replicates in the \"Core\" capsid that is in [[cytoplasm]], not having to use the host replication polymerases to as much a degree as [[DNA]] viruses. This family is also not as well-studied as the rest and includes 2 major families, the [[Reoviridae]] and [[Birnaviridae]]. Replication is [[monocistronic]] and includes individual, segmented genomes, meaning that each of the genes codes for only one protein, unlike other viruses that exhibit more complex translation.\n\n===Group IV & V: Single-stranded RNA viruses===\nThe ssRNA viruses  belong to Class IV or V  of the Baltimore classification. They could be grouped into positive sense or negative sense according to the sense of polarity of RNA.  The single  stranded RNA is the common feature of these viruses. The replication of viruses happens in the cytoplasm or nucleus (for segmented class V viruses).  \nClass IV and V ssRNA viruses do not depend as heavily as DNA viruses on the cell cycle.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}\n\n====Group IV: Single-stranded RNA viruses - Positive-sense====\n{{Main|positive-sense ssRNA virus}}\nThe positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all RNA defined as '''[[Sense (molecular biology)|positive-sense]]''' can be directly accessed by the host ribosomes immediately to form proteins. These can be divided into two groups, both of which reproduce in the cytoplasm:\n\n* Viruses with [[polycistronic]] [[mRNA]] where the genome RNA forms the mRNA and is translated into a [[polyprotein]] product that is subsequently cleaved to form the mature proteins. This means that the gene can utilize a few methods in which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA, all in the sake of reducing the size of its gene.\n* Viruses with complex transcription, for which [[subgenomic]] mRNAs, [[ribosomal frameshifting]], and [[proteolytic]] processing of polyproteins may be used. All of which are different mechanisms with which to produce proteins from the same strand of RNA.\n\nExamples of this class include the families [[Astroviridae]], [[Caliciviridae]], [[Coronaviridae]], [[Flaviviridae]], [[Picornaviridae]], [[Arteriviridae]], and [[Togaviridae]].\n\n====Group V: Single-stranded RNA viruses - Negative-sense====\n{{Main|negative-sense ssRNA virus}}\nThe negative-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as '''[[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]]''' cannot be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins. Instead, they must be [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] by viral polymerases into a \"readable\" form, which is the positive-sense reciprocal. These can also be divided into two groups:\n\n* Viruses containing nonsegmented [[genomes]] for which the first step in replication is transcription from the (-)-stranded genome by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to yield monocistronic mRNAs that code for the various viral proteins. A positive-sense genome copy is then produced that serves as template for production of the (-)-strand genome. Replication is within the cytoplasm.\n* Viruses with segmented genomes for which replication occurs in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and for which the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase produces monocistronic mRNAs from each genome segment. The largest difference between the two is the location of replication.\n\nExamples in this class include the families [[Arenaviridae]], [[Orthomyxoviridae]], [[Paramyxoviridae]], [[Filoviridae]], and [[Rhabdoviridae]] (the latter of which includes the [[rabies virus]]).\n\n===Group VI: Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate===\n{{Main|ssRNA-RT virus}}\nA well-studied family of this class of viruses include the [[Retroviridae|retroviruses]]. One defining feature is the use of [[reverse transcriptase]] to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA.  Instead of using the RNA for templates of proteins, they use DNA to create the templates, which is spliced into the host genome using [[integrase]]. Replication can then commence with the help of the host cell's polymerases.\n\n===Group VII: Double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate===\n{{Main|dsDNA-RT virus}}\nThis small group of viruses, exemplified by the [[Hepatitis B]] virus (which is in the [[Hepadnaviridae]] family), have a double-stranded, gapped genome that is subsequently filled in to form a covalently closed circle ([[cccDNA]]) that serves as a template for production of viral [[mRNA]]s and a [[subgenomic]] RNA.  The pregenome RNA serves as template for the viral reverse transcriptase for production of the DNA genome.\n\nOther pararetroviruses can be found within the ''Caulimoviridae'' family which is uniquely formed by plant infecting viruses.\nPararetroviruses are distantly related to the Group VI retroviruses, with Caulimoviridae even being part of the Ortervirales order. Both Hepadnaviridae and Caulimoviridae have lost the integration step during their replication cycle and have evolved to encapsidate DNA instead of RNA. However, the Caulimoviridae family is more closely related to the Retroviridae family then to the Hepadnaviridae. This suggests that both families of pararetroviruses have evolved separately from a retrovirus-like ancestor to pararetroviruses.<ref>Krupovic, Mart, Jonas Blomberg, John M.

He was a politician in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colonial Massachusetts]], a leader of the movement that became the [[American Revolution]], and one of the architects of the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]] that shaped the political culture of the United States. He was a second cousin to his fellow Founding Father, President [[John Adams]].\n\nAdams was born in [[Boston]], brought up in a religious and politically active family. A graduate of [[Harvard College]], he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and the [[Boston Town Meeting]] in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]'s efforts to tax the [[British America]]n colonies without their consent. His 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]] calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a [[committee of correspondence]] system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the [[British Constitution]] at the expense of the colonies, which linked like-minded [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]] and the coming of the American Revolution.\n\nParliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] in 1774, at which time Adams attended the [[Continental Congress]] in Philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response. He helped guide Congress towards issuing the [[Continental Association]] in 1774 and the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, and he helped draft the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[Massachusetts Constitution]]. Adams returned to Massachusetts after the American Revolution, where he served in the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]] and was eventually elected governor.\n\nSamuel Adams later became a controversial figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams in the first half of the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of [[propaganda]] who provoked [[mob violence]] to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record.\n\n==Early life==\nSamuel Adams was born in [[Boston]] in the British colony of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] on September 16, 1722, an [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style date]] that is sometimes converted to the New Style date of September 27.{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=14}} Adams was one of twelve children born to [[Samuel Adams, Sr.]], and Mary (Fifield) Adams in an age of high infant mortality; only three of these children lived past their third birthday.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=4}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=22}} Adams's parents were devout [[Puritan]]s and members of the [[Old South Meeting House|Old South Congregational Church]]. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=21}} Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially [[virtue]].{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=41}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=42}}\n\nSamuel Adams, Sr. (1689\u20131748) was a prosperous merchant and church [[deacon]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=3}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=4}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}} Deacon Adams became a leading figure in Boston politics through an organization that became known as the [[Boston Caucus]], which promoted candidates who supported popular causes.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=19}} The Boston Caucus helped shape the agenda of the [[Boston Town Meeting]]. A New England [[town meeting]] is a form of [[local government]] with elected officials, and not just a gathering of citizens; according to historian [[William M. Fowler, Jr.|William Fowler]], it was \"the most democratic institution in the British empire\".{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}} Deacon Adams rose through the political ranks, becoming a justice of the peace, a [[Boston Board of Selectmen|selectman]], and a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=7}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=8}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}} He worked closely with [[Elisha Cooke, Jr.]] (1678\u20131737), the leader of the \"popular party\", a faction that resisted any encroachment by royal officials on the colonial rights embodied in the [[Massachusetts Charter]] of 1691.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=9}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}} In the coming years, members of the \"popular party\" became known as Whigs or [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A four-story brick building with many windows.|While at Harvard, Adams boarded at [[Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University|Massachusetts Hall]].{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=16}}]]\n\nThe younger Samuel Adams attended [[Boston Latin School]] and then entered [[Harvard College]] in 1736. His parents hoped that his schooling would prepare him for the ministry, but Adams gradually shifted his interest to politics.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=25}} After graduating in 1740, Adams continued his studies, earning a [[Master of Arts|master's degree]] in 1743.

He considered becoming a lawyer, but instead decided to go into business.

He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market.

Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=54}}\n\n==Struggle with Great Britain==\nSamuel Adams emerged as an important public figure in Boston soon after the [[British Empire]]'s victory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and they sought to directly tax the colonies of [[British America]] for the first time.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=50}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}} This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.</ref>\n\n===Sugar Act===\nThe first step in the new program was the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, which Adams saw as an infringement of longstanding colonial rights. Colonists were not represented in Parliament, he argued, and therefore they could not be taxed by that body; the colonists were represented by the colonial assemblies, and only they could levy taxes upon them.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=51}} Adams expressed these views in May 1764, when the Boston Town Meeting elected its representatives to the Massachusetts House. As was customary, the town meeting provided the representatives with a set of written instructions, which Adams was selected to write. Adams highlighted what he perceived to be the dangers of [[taxation without representation]]:\n\n<blockquote>For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & everything we possess or make use of? This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves. It strikes at our British privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves?{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=51}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}<ref>The complete text is in Cushing, ''Writings'', 1:1\u20137.</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"When the Boston Town Meeting approved the Adams instructions on May 24, 1764,\" writes historian John K. Alexander, \"it became the first political body in America to go on record stating Parliament could not constitutionally tax the colonists. The directives also contained the first official recommendation that the colonies present a unified defense of their rights.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Adams's instructions were published in newspapers and pamphlets, and he soon became closely associated with [[James Otis, Jr.]], a member of the Massachusetts House famous for his defense of colonial rights.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Otis boldly challenged the constitutionality of certain acts of Parliament, but he would not go as far as Adams, who was moving towards the conclusion that Parliament did not have sovereignty over the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=22}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=53}}\n\n===Stamp Act===\nIn 1765, Parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] which required colonists to pay a new tax on most printed materials.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=18}} News of the passage of the Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=50}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=51}} The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions.

He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=25}}\n\nIn Boston, a group called the [[Loyal Nine]], a precursor to the [[Sons of Liberty]], organized protests of the Stamp Act.

As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=30}} James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author of a series of House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances|those passed]] by the Stamp Act Congress.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=32}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}} Adams was one of the first colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain [[natural rights]] that governments could not violate.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}}\n\nThe Stamp Act was scheduled to go into effect on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}} Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to repeal the tax.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=37}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=62}} By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=112}}\n\nThe Massachusetts popular party gained ground in the May 1766 elections.

These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a [[customs]] agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=49}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}}\n\nResistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not in session when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams therefore used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'', a series of popular essays by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such a wide audience.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}}\n\nIn January 1768, the Massachusetts House sent a petition to King George asking for his help.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}}<ref>In London, the petition to the king was published, along with other documents, by [[Thomas Hollis (1720\u20131774)|Thomas Hollis]] under the title \"The True Sentiments of America\"</ref>{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=109}} Adams and Otis requested that the House send the petition to the other colonies, along with what became known as the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]], which became \"a significant milestone on the road to revolution\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}} The letter written by Adams called on the colonies to join with Massachusetts in resisting the Townshend Acts.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=78}} The House initially voted against sending the letter and petition to the other colonies but, after some politicking by Adams and Otis, it was approved on February 11.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=78}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=79}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=80}}\n\nBritish [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial secretary]] [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], hoping to prevent a repeat of the Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter.

Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important [[separation of powers|check on executive power]], keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=22}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=117}} In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=106|loc=\"Adams and others had previously suspected that Hutchinson's salary was being paid by the Crown; this had been unconfirmed until this development\"}} To protest this, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of [[committee of correspondence|committees of correspondence]] in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=84}} Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.\n\nGovernor Hutchinson became concerned that the committees of correspondence were growing into an independence movement, so he convened the General Court in January 1773.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=111}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=112}} Addressing the legislature, Hutchinson argued that denying the supremacy of Parliament, as some committees had done, came dangerously close to rebellion. \"I know of no line that can be drawn\", he said, \"between the supreme authority of Parliament and the total independence of the colonies.\"{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=120}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=112}} Adams and the House responded that the Massachusetts Charter did not establish Parliament's supremacy over the province, and so Parliament could not claim that authority now.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=112}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=113}} Hutchinson soon realized that he had made a major blunder by initiating a public debate about independence and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=114}} The Boston Committee of Correspondence published its statement of colonial rights, along with Hutchinson's exchange with the Massachusetts House, in the widely distributed \"[[Boston Pamphlet]]\".{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=120}}\n\nThe quiet period in Massachusetts was over. Adams was easily re-elected to the Massachusetts House in May 1773, and was also elected as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=116}} In June 1773, he introduced a [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|set of private letters]] to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London that there should be \"an abridgement of what are called English liberties\" in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied that this is what he meant, but his career was effectively over in Massachusetts, and the House sent a petition asking the king to recall him.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=118}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=119}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=121}}<ref>Hutchinson maintained that he was predicting a curtailment of liberty, rather than recommending it; for the modern scholarly analysis of the letters affair, see Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson'' (Cambridge, 1974).</ref>\n\n===Tea Party===\nAdams took a leading role in the events that led up to the famous [[Boston Tea Party]] of December 16, 1773, although the precise nature of his involvement has been disputed.\n\nIn May 1773, the British Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]], a tax law to help the struggling [[East India Company]], one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea that it could not sell.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 248\u201349</ref>{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=334}} The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies. The Tea Act permitted the East India Company to export tea directly to the colonies for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=67}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=70}} This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted the Tea Company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers, driving them out of business. The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charlestown]] were selected to receive the company's tea for resale.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=75}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=76}} In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=78}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=79}}\n\nNews of the Tea Act set off a firestorm of protest in the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=122}} This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act. Protesters were instead concerned with a variety of other issues. The familiar \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" argument remained prominent, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 246.</ref> Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the right to tax them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}} The \"power of the purse\" conflict was still at issue. The tea tax revenues were to be used to pay the salaries of certain royal officials, making them independent of the people.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=78}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=106}} Colonial smugglers played a significant role in the protests, since the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, which threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=102}}<ref>See also John W.

The first of these acts was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed Boston's commerce until the East India Company had been repaid for the destroyed tea. The [[Massachusetts Government Act]] rewrote the Massachusetts Charter, making many officials royally appointed rather than elected, and severely restricting the activities of town meetings. The [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] allowed colonists charged with crimes to be transported to another colony or to Great Britain for trial.

It reflected Adams's belief that \"a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law whatever that he has not approved of, either directly, or through his representatives\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}} By modern standards, the new constitution was not \"[[democracy|democratic]]\"; Adams, like most of his peers, believed that only free males who owned property should be allowed to vote, and that the senate and the governor served to balance any excesses that might result from majority rule.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=183}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=185}}\n\nIn 1781, Adams retired from the Continental Congress. His health was one reason; he was approaching his sixtieth birthday and suffered from [[essential tremor|tremors]] that made writing difficult.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=167}} But he also wanted to return to Massachusetts to influence politics in the Commonwealth.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}} He returned to Boston in 1781, and never left Massachusetts again.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=170}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=171}}\n\n==Return to Massachusetts==\nAdams remained active in politics upon his return to Massachusetts. He frequently served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, and was elected to the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]], where he often served as that body's [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|president]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams focused his political agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential in a republican government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent in this campaign was his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Hancock; the two men had a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} Adams favored [[James Bowdoin]] for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=186}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=187}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams's promotion of public virtue took several forms. He played a major role in getting Boston to provide a free public education for children, even for girls, which was controversial.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=192}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=194}} Adams was one of the charter members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Charter of Incorporation|url=http://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx#chartermbrs|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103142200/https://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx#chartermbrs#chartermbrs|archive-date=January 3, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the Revolutionary War, Adams joined others, including Thomas Jefferson, in denouncing the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], an organization of former army officers. Adams worried that the  Society was \"a stride towards an hereditary military nobility\", and thus a threat to republicanism.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=196}} Adams also believed that public theaters undermined civic virtue, and he joined an ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep theaters banned in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=404}} Decades after Adams's death, orator [[Edward Everett]] called him \"the last of the Puritans\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=47|loc=quoting Everett's 1835 \"Battle of Lexington\" oration}}\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=''I firmly believe that the benevolent Creator designed the republican Form of Government for Man.''|source=Samuel Adams, April 14, 1785{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=44}}<ref>Cushing, ''Writings'', 4:314</ref>}}\n\nPostwar economic troubles in western Massachusetts led to an uprising known as [[Shays's Rebellion]], which began in 1786. Small farmers, angered by high taxes and debts, armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in two counties. Governor James Bowdoin sent four thousand militiamen to put down the uprising, an action supported by Adams.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}} His old political ally [[James Warren (politician)|James Warren]] thought that Adams had forsaken his principles, but Adams saw no contradiction. He approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government, as had happened during the American Revolution, but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government, where problems should be remedied through elections. He thought that the leaders of Shays's Rebellion should be hanged, reportedly saying that \"the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=30}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=31}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}\n\nShays's Rebellion contributed to the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention]], instead of revising the Articles, created a new [[United States Constitution]] with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. \"I confess,\" he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, \"as I enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}} Adams was one of those derisively labeled [[Anti-Federalism|\"Anti-Federalists\"]] by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves \"Federalists\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=204}} Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts ratifying convention]] which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=205}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=206}} Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=260}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=261}} Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=207}}\n\nWhile Adams was attending the ratifying convention, his only son Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=255}} The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did not alter their frugal lifestyle.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=219}}\n\nAdams was concerned about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the December 1788 election, but lost to [[Fisher Ames]], apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=210}} Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=211}} Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=215}}\n\nIn 1789, Adams was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts#Lieutenant Governor|Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] and served in that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting governor. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, the first of four annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]], who were opposed to the [[Federalist Party]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=213}} Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}} Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=217}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=227}} In that year's [[1796 United States presidential election|U. S. presidential election]], Republicans in Virginia cast 15 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for Adams in an effort to make him Jefferson's vice-president,{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=409}} but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=219}}\n\nSamuel Adams took a cue from President Washington, who declined to run for reelection in 1796: he retired from politics at the end of his term as governor in 1797.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=218}} Adams suffered from what is now believed to have been [[essential tremor]], a movement disorder that rendered him unable to write in the final decade of his life.<ref>{{cite web| title = Samuel Adams' tremor | publisher = Neurology (2001) 56:1201\u201305 (online abstract) | author = Elan D.

A weathered plaque on the stone reads: \"Samuel Adams, Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Governor of this Commonwealth, A Leader of Men and an ardent Patriot.\"]]\n\nSamuel Adams is a controversial figure in American history. Disagreement about his significance and reputation began before his death and continues to the present.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=8}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=82}}\n\nAdams' contemporaries, both friends and foes, regarded him as one of the foremost leaders of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson, for example, characterized Adams as \"truly the ''Man of the Revolution''.\"{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=5}} Leaders in other colonies were compared to him; [[Cornelius Harnett]] was called the \"Samuel Adams of North Carolina\", [[Charles Thomson]] the \"Samuel Adams of Philadelphia\",{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}} and [[Christopher Gadsden]] the \"Sam Adams of the South\".<ref>E. Stanly Godbold, \"Gadsden, Christopher\"; ''American National Biography Online'',  February 2000.</ref> When John Adams traveled to France during the Revolution, he had to explain that he was not Samuel, \"the famous Adams\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}}\n\nSupporters of the Revolution praised Adams, but Loyalists viewed him as a sinister figure. [[Peter Oliver (jurist)|Peter Oliver]], the exiled chief justice of Massachusetts, characterized him as a devious [[Machiavelli]]an with a \"cloven Foot\".{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=82}} Thomas Hutchinson, Adams' political foe, took his revenge in his ''History of Massachusetts Bay'', in which he denounced him as a dishonest character assassin, emphasizing his failures as a businessman and tax collector. This hostile \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams was revived in the 20th century by historian Clifford K. Shipton in the ''[[Harvard College#Sibley's Harvard Graduates|Sibley's Harvard Graduates]]'' reference series.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=83}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}} Shipton wrote positive portraits of Hutchinson and Oliver and scathing sketches of Adams and Hancock; his entry on Adams was characterized by historian [[Pauline Maier]] as \"forty-five pages of contempt\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}\n\nWhig historians challenged the \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams. William Gordon and [[Mercy Otis Warren]], two historians who knew Adams, wrote of him as a man selflessly dedicated to the American Revolution.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}} But in the early 19th century, Adams was often viewed as an old-fashioned Puritan, and was consequently neglected by historians.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}} Interest in Adams was revived in the mid-19th century. Historian [[George Bancroft]] portrayed him favorably in his monumental ''History of the United States from the Discovery of the American Continent'' (1852). The first full biography of Adams appeared in 1865, a three-volume work written by William Wells, his great-grandson.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} The Wells biography is still valuable for its wealth of information,<ref name=\"ANB\" /> although Whig portrayals of Adams were uncritically pro-American and had elements of [[hagiography]], a view that influenced some later biographies written for general audiences.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=92}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=229}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=230}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, many American historians were uncomfortable with contemporary revolutions and found it problematic to write approvingly about Adams. Relations had improved between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and Adams' role in dividing Americans from Britons was increasingly viewed with regret.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=14}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} In 1885, James Hosmer wrote a biography that praised Adams, but also found some of his actions troubling, such as the 1773 publication of Hutchinson's private letters.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=9}} Subsequent biographers became increasingly hostile towards Adams and the common people whom he represented. In 1923, Ralph V. Harlow used a \"[[Freudian]]\" approach to characterize Adams as a \"neurotic crank\" driven by an \"inferiority complex\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}}<ref>See Ralph V. Harlow, ''Samuel Adams, Promoter of the American Revolution: A Study in Psychology and Politics'' (Holt, 1923).</ref> Harlow argued that, because the masses were easily misled, Adams \"manufactured public opinion\" to produce the Revolution, a view that became the thesis of John C. Miller's 1936 biography ''Sam Adams: Pioneer in Propaganda''.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}} Miller portrayed Adams more as an incendiary revolutionary than an adroit political operative, attributing to this one man all the acts of Boston's \"body of the people\", and consistently calling his subject \"Sam\", despite the fact that Adams was almost always known as \"Samuel\" in his lifetime.<ref name=\"ANB\" />{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=58}}{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=59}}\n\nMiller's influential book became, in the words of historian Charles Akers, the \"scholarly enshrinement\" of \"the myth of Sam Adams as the Boston dictator who almost single-handedly led his colony into rebellion\".<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 120\u201321.</ref> According to Akers, Miller and other historians used \"Sam did it\" to explain crowd actions and other developments, without citing any evidence that Adams directed those events.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 121\u201322.</ref> In 1974, Akers called on historians to critically re-examine the sources rather than simply repeating the myth.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 130.</ref> By then, scholars were increasingly rejecting the notion that Adams and others used \"propaganda\" to incite \"ignorant mobs\", and were instead portraying a revolutionary Massachusetts too complex to have been controlled by one man.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=93}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=94}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=95}} Historian [[Pauline Maier]] argued that Adams, far from being a radical mob leader, took a moderate position based on the English revolutionary tradition that imposed strict constraints on resistance to authority. That belief justified force only against threats to the constitutional rights so grave that the \"body of the people\" recognized the danger, and only after all peaceful means of redress had failed. Within that revolutionary tradition, resistance was essentially conservative. In 2004, [[Ray Raphael]]'s ''Founding Myths'' continued Maier's line by deconstructing several of the \"Sam\" Adams myths that are still repeated in many textbooks and popular histories.{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=45-63}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 2008 miniseries [[John Adams (miniseries)|''John Adams'']], Samuel Adams was played by [[Danny Huston]].\n\nAdams is the main protagonist in the 2015 miniseries [[Sons of Liberty (miniseries)|''Sons of Liberty'']], portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]].\n\nSamuel Adams's name has been appropriated by commercial and non-profit ventures since his death.

He was a politician in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|colonial Massachusetts]], a leader of the movement that became the [[American Revolution]], and one of the architects of the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]] that shaped the political culture of the United States. He was a second cousin to his fellow Founding Father, President [[John Adams]].\n\nAdams was born in [[Boston]], brought up in a religious and politically active family. A graduate of [[Harvard College]], he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] and the [[Boston Town Meeting]] in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]'s efforts to tax the [[British America]]n colonies without their consent. His 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]] calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the [[Boston Massacre]] of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a [[committee of correspondence]] system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the [[British Constitution]] at the expense of the colonies, which linked like-minded [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]] and the coming of the American Revolution.\n\nParliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] in 1774, at which time Adams attended the [[Continental Congress]] in Philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response. He helped guide Congress towards issuing the [[Continental Association]] in 1774 and the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, and he helped draft the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[Massachusetts Constitution]]. Adams returned to Massachusetts after the American Revolution, where he served in the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]] and was eventually elected governor.\n\nSamuel Adams later became a controversial figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams in the first half of the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of [[propaganda]] who provoked [[mob violence]] to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record.\n\n==Early life==\nSamuel Adams was born in [[Boston]] in the British colony of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] on September 16, 1722, an [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style date]] that is sometimes converted to the New Style date of September 27.{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=14}} Adams was one of twelve children born to [[Samuel Adams, Sr.]], and Mary (Fifield) Adams in an age of high infant mortality; only three of these children lived past their third birthday.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=4}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=22}} Adams's parents were devout [[Puritan]]s and members of the [[Old South Meeting House|Old South Congregational Church]]. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=21}} Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially [[virtue]].{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=41}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=42}}\n\nSamuel Adams, Sr. (1689\u20131748) was a prosperous merchant and church [[deacon]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=3}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=4}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}} Deacon Adams became a leading figure in Boston politics through an organization that became known as the [[Boston Caucus]], which promoted candidates who supported popular causes.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=19}} The Boston Caucus helped shape the agenda of the [[Boston Town Meeting]]. A New England [[town meeting]] is a form of [[local government]] with elected officials, and not just a gathering of citizens; according to historian [[William M. Fowler, Jr.|William Fowler]], it was \"the most democratic institution in the British empire\".{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=2}} Deacon Adams rose through the political ranks, becoming a justice of the peace, a [[Boston Board of Selectmen|selectman]], and a member of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=7}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=8}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}} He worked closely with [[Elisha Cooke, Jr.]] (1678\u20131737), the leader of the \"popular party\", a faction that resisted any encroachment by royal officials on the colonial rights embodied in the [[Massachusetts Charter]] of 1691.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=9}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=23}} In the coming years, members of the \"popular party\" became known as Whigs or [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A four-story brick building with many windows.|While at Harvard, Adams boarded at [[Massachusetts Hall, Harvard University|Massachusetts Hall]].{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=16}}]]\n\nThe younger Samuel Adams attended [[Boston Latin School]] and then entered [[Harvard College]] in 1736. His parents hoped that his schooling would prepare him for the ministry, but Adams gradually shifted his interest to politics.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=25}} After graduating in 1740, Adams continued his studies, earning a [[Master of Arts|master's degree]] in 1743. In his thesis, he argued that it was \"lawful to resist the Supreme Magistrate, if the Commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved\", which indicated that his political views, like his father's, were oriented towards colonial rights.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=15}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=16}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=25}}\n\nAdams's life was greatly affected by his father's involvement in a banking controversy. In 1739, Massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage, and Deacon Adams and the Boston Caucus created a \"land bank\" which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=4}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=21}} The land bank was generally supported by the citizenry and the popular party, which dominated the House of Representatives, the lower branch of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]]. Opposition to the land bank came from the more aristocratic \"court party\", who were supporters of the [[list of colonial governors of Massachusetts|royal governor]] and controlled the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Governor's Council]], the upper chamber of the General Court.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=5}} The court party used its influence to have the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] dissolve the land bank in 1741.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=6}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=23}} Directors of the land bank, including Deacon Adams, became personally liable for the currency still in circulation, payable in silver and gold. Lawsuits over the bank persisted for years, even after Deacon Adams's death, and the younger Samuel Adams often had to defend the family estate from seizure by the government.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=6}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=10}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=11}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=12}} For Adams, these lawsuits \"served as a constant personal reminder that Britain's power over the colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=12}}\n\n==Early career==\nAfter leaving Harvard in 1743, Adams was unsure about his future. He considered becoming a lawyer, but instead decided to go into business. He worked at Thomas Cushing's [[counting house]], but the job only lasted a few months because Cushing felt that Adams was too preoccupied with politics to become a good merchant.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=17}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=3}} Adams's father then lent him [[Massachusetts pound|\u00a3]]1,000 to go into business for himself, a substantial amount for that time.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=3}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=4}} Adams's lack of business instincts were confirmed; he lent half of this money to a friend who never repaid, and frittered away the other half. Adams always remained, in the words of historian [[Pauline Maier]], \"a man utterly uninterested in either making or possessing money\".<ref name=\"ANB\">Maier, ''American National Biography''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Old South Meetinghouse BW.jpg|thumb|175px|alt=On a city street, an old brick church with a tall steeple is surrounded by modern buildings.|The [[Old South Meeting House]] (''1968 photo shown'') was Adams's church. During the crisis with Great Britain, mass meetings were held here that were too large for [[Faneuil Hall]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=58}}]]\n\nAfter Adams had lost his money, his father made him a partner in the family's [[malthouse]], which was next to the family home on Purchase Street. Several generations of Adamses were maltsters, who produced the [[malt]] necessary for [[brewing]] beer.{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=74}} Years later, a poet poked fun at Adams by calling him \"Sam the maltster\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=24}} Adams has often been described as a brewer, but the extant evidence suggests that he worked as a maltster and not a brewer.{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=74}}{{sfn|Baron|1962|p=75}}<ref>Stoll  (''Samuel Adams'', 275n16) notes that [[James Koch]], founder of the [[Boston Beer Company]], reports having been offered for purchase a receipt for [[hops]] signed by Adams, which indicates that Adams may have done some brewing.</ref>\n\nIn January 1748, Adams and some friends were inflamed by British [[impressment]] and launched ''[[The Independent Advertiser]]'', a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=17}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=18}} His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Government]]'', and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=21}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}} He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}} He cited the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] as an example of what could happen to [[New England]] if it were to abandon its Puritan values.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=19}}\n\nWhen Deacon Adams died in 1748, Adams was given the responsibility of managing the family's affairs.{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=30}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=31}} In October 1749, he married Elizabeth Checkley, his pastor's daughter.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=34}} Elizabeth gave birth to six children over the next seven years, but only two lived to adulthood: Samuel (born 1751) and Hannah (born 1756).{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}} In July 1757, Elizabeth died soon after giving birth to a stillborn son.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=31}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=32}} Adams remarried in 1764 to Elizabeth Wells,{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=55}} but had no other children.<ref name=\"ANB\" />\n\nLike his father, Adams embarked on a political career with the support of the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=8}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=14}} He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=14|loc=\"The failure to collect all taxes was a Boston tradition\"}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=19}} By 1765, his account was more than \u00a38,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=27}} In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of \u00a31,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=54}}\n\n==Struggle with Great Britain==\nSamuel Adams emerged as an important public figure in Boston soon after the [[British Empire]]'s victory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763). The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and they sought to directly tax the colonies of [[British America]] for the first time.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=50}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}} This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.</ref>\n\n===Sugar Act===\nThe first step in the new program was the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764, which Adams saw as an infringement of longstanding colonial rights. Colonists were not represented in Parliament, he argued, and therefore they could not be taxed by that body; the colonists were represented by the colonial assemblies, and only they could levy taxes upon them.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=51}} Adams expressed these views in May 1764, when the Boston Town Meeting elected its representatives to the Massachusetts House. As was customary, the town meeting provided the representatives with a set of written instructions, which Adams was selected to write. Adams highlighted what he perceived to be the dangers of [[taxation without representation]]:\n\n<blockquote>For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our Lands & everything we possess or make use of? This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves. It strikes at our British privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves?{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=51}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}<ref>The complete text is in Cushing, ''Writings'', 1:1\u20137.</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"When the Boston Town Meeting approved the Adams instructions on May 24, 1764,\" writes historian John K. Alexander, \"it became the first political body in America to go on record stating Parliament could not constitutionally tax the colonists. The directives also contained the first official recommendation that the colonies present a unified defense of their rights.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Adams's instructions were published in newspapers and pamphlets, and he soon became closely associated with [[James Otis, Jr.]], a member of the Massachusetts House famous for his defense of colonial rights.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=21}} Otis boldly challenged the constitutionality of certain acts of Parliament, but he would not go as far as Adams, who was moving towards the conclusion that Parliament did not have sovereignty over the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=22}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=23}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=53}}\n\n===Stamp Act===\nIn 1765, Parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] which required colonists to pay a new tax on most printed materials.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=17}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=18}} News of the passage of the Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies.{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=50}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=51}} The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a [[Stamp Act Congress]] to coordinate colonial resistance.{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=61}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}} The Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] passed a widely reprinted [[Virginia Resolves|set of resolves]] against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}} Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=24}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=25}}\n\nIn Boston, a group called the [[Loyal Nine]], a precursor to the [[Sons of Liberty]], organized protests of the Stamp Act. Adams was friendly with the Loyal Nine but was not a member.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Miller|1936|p=53}} On August 14, stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]] was hanged in effigy from Boston's [[Liberty Tree]]; that night, his home was ransacked and his office demolished. On August 26, lieutenant governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson's]] home was destroyed by an angry crowd.\n\n[[File:Safhall1 copy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A statue on a pedestal of a man standing with his arms crossed.

As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=30}} James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author of a series of House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances|those passed]] by the Stamp Act Congress.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=32}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}} Adams was one of the first colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain [[natural rights]] that governments could not violate.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}}\n\nThe Stamp Act was scheduled to go into effect on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=33}} Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to repeal the tax.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=37}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=62}} By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=112}}\n\nThe Massachusetts popular party gained ground in the May 1766 elections. Adams was re-elected to the House and selected as its clerk, in which position he was responsible for official House papers.

These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a [[customs]] agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=49}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}}\n\nResistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not in session when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams therefore used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=50}} Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'', a series of popular essays by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such a wide audience.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}}\n\nIn January 1768, the Massachusetts House sent a petition to King George asking for his help.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}}<ref>In London, the petition to the king was published, along with other documents, by [[Thomas Hollis (1720\u20131774)|Thomas Hollis]] under the title \"The True Sentiments of America\"</ref>{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=109}} Adams and Otis requested that the House send the petition to the other colonies, along with what became known as the [[Massachusetts Circular Letter]], which became \"a significant milestone on the road to revolution\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=51}} The letter written by Adams called on the colonies to join with Massachusetts in resisting the Townshend Acts.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=78}} The House initially voted against sending the letter and petition to the other colonies but, after some politicking by Adams and Otis, it was approved on February 11.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=78}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=79}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=80}}\n\nBritish [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial secretary]] [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], hoping to prevent a repeat of the Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter.

Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges.

Adams was easily re-elected to the Massachusetts House in May 1773, and was also elected as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=116}} In June 1773, he introduced a [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|set of private letters]] to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London that there should be \"an abridgement of what are called English liberties\" in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied that this is what he meant, but his career was effectively over in Massachusetts, and the House sent a petition asking the king to recall him.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=118}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=119}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=121}}<ref>Hutchinson maintained that he was predicting a curtailment of liberty, rather than recommending it; for the modern scholarly analysis of the letters affair, see Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson'' (Cambridge, 1974).</ref>\n\n===Tea Party===\nAdams took a leading role in the events that led up to the famous [[Boston Tea Party]] of December 16, 1773, although the precise nature of his involvement has been disputed.\n\nIn May 1773, the British Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]], a tax law to help the struggling [[East India Company]], one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea that it could not sell.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 248\u201349</ref>{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=334}} The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies.

The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charlestown]] were selected to receive the company's tea for resale.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=75}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=76}} In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston.{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=78}}{{sfn|Labaree|1979|p=79}}\n\nNews of the Tea Act set off a firestorm of protest in the colonies.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}}{{sfn|Fowler|Fowler|1997|p=122}} This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act.

The familiar \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" argument remained prominent, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.<ref>Thomas, ''Townshend Duties'', 246.</ref> Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the right to tax them.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=120}} The \"power of the purse\" conflict was still at issue.

After a delay to rally support, Congress approved the language of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776, which Adams signed.\n\nAfter the Declaration of Independence, Congress continued to manage the war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the [[Board of War]] in 1777.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=157}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=468}} He advocated paying bonuses to [[Continental Army]] soldiers to encourage them to reenlist for the duration of the war.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=158}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=159}} He called for harsh state legislation to punish [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]\u2014Americans who continued to support the British crown\u2014who Adams believed were as dangerous to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=162}} After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=194}}\n\nAdams was the Massachusetts delegate appointed to the committee to draft the [[Articles of Confederation]], the plan for the colonial confederation. With its emphasis on state sovereignty, the Articles reflected Congress's wariness of a strong central government, a concern shared by Adams. Like others at the time, Adams considered himself a citizen of the United States while continuing to refer to Massachusetts as his \"country\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=163}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=197}} After much debate, the Articles were sent to the states for ratification in November 1777. From Philadelphia, Adams urged Massachusetts to ratify, which it did. Adams signed the Articles of Confederation with the other Massachusetts delegates in 1778, but they were not ratified by all the states until 1781.\n\nAdams returned to Boston in 1779 to attend a state constitutional convention. The Massachusetts General Court had proposed a new constitution the previous year, but voters rejected it, and so a convention was held to try again. Adams was appointed to a three-man drafting committee with his cousin John Adams and [[James Bowdoin]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=181}} They drafted the [[Massachusetts Constitution]], which was amended by the convention and approved by voters in 1780. The new constitution established a republican form of government, with annual elections and a [[separation of powers]]. It reflected Adams's belief that \"a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law whatever that he has not approved of, either directly, or through his representatives\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}} By modern standards, the new constitution was not \"[[democracy|democratic]]\"; Adams, like most of his peers, believed that only free males who owned property should be allowed to vote, and that the senate and the governor served to balance any excesses that might result from majority rule.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=183}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=184}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=185}}\n\nIn 1781, Adams retired from the Continental Congress. His health was one reason; he was approaching his sixtieth birthday and suffered from [[essential tremor|tremors]] that made writing difficult.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=167}} But he also wanted to return to Massachusetts to influence politics in the Commonwealth.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}} He returned to Boston in 1781, and never left Massachusetts again.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=170}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=171}}\n\n==Return to Massachusetts==\nAdams remained active in politics upon his return to Massachusetts. He frequently served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, and was elected to the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]], where he often served as that body's [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|president]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams focused his political agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential in a republican government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent in this campaign was his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Hancock; the two men had a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=178}} Adams favored [[James Bowdoin]] for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=186}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=187}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=189}}\n\nAdams's promotion of public virtue took several forms. He played a major role in getting Boston to provide a free public education for children, even for girls, which was controversial.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=192}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=194}} Adams was one of the charter members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Charter of Incorporation|url=http://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx#chartermbrs|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103142200/https://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx#chartermbrs#chartermbrs|archive-date=January 3, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the Revolutionary War, Adams joined others, including Thomas Jefferson, in denouncing the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], an organization of former army officers. Adams worried that the  Society was \"a stride towards an hereditary military nobility\", and thus a threat to republicanism.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=196}} Adams also believed that public theaters undermined civic virtue, and he joined an ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep theaters banned in Boston.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=193}}{{sfn|Hosmer|1885|p=404}} Decades after Adams's death, orator [[Edward Everett]] called him \"the last of the Puritans\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=47|loc=quoting Everett's 1835 \"Battle of Lexington\" oration}}\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=''I firmly believe that the benevolent Creator designed the republican Form of Government for Man.''|source=Samuel Adams, April 14, 1785{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=44}}<ref>Cushing, ''Writings'', 4:314</ref>}}\n\nPostwar economic troubles in western Massachusetts led to an uprising known as [[Shays's Rebellion]], which began in 1786. Small farmers, angered by high taxes and debts, armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in two counties. Governor James Bowdoin sent four thousand militiamen to put down the uprising, an action supported by Adams.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}} His old political ally [[James Warren (politician)|James Warren]] thought that Adams had forsaken his principles, but Adams saw no contradiction. He approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government, as had happened during the American Revolution, but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government, where problems should be remedied through elections. He thought that the leaders of Shays's Rebellion should be hanged, reportedly saying that \"the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=30}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=31}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=202}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}\n\nShays's Rebellion contributed to the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention]], instead of revising the Articles, created a new [[United States Constitution]] with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. \"I confess,\" he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, \"as I enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States.\"{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}} Adams was one of those derisively labeled [[Anti-Federalism|\"Anti-Federalists\"]] by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves \"Federalists\".{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=203}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=204}} Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts ratifying convention]] which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=205}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=206}} Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=260}}{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=261}} Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=207}}\n\nWhile Adams was attending the ratifying convention, his only son Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams.{{sfn|Wells|1865|p=255}} The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did not alter their frugal lifestyle.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=219}}\n\nAdams was concerned about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the December 1788 election, but lost to [[Fisher Ames]], apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=210}} Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=211}} Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=215}}\n\nIn 1789, Adams was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts#Lieutenant Governor|Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] and served in that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting governor. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, the first of four annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]], who were opposed to the [[Federalist Party]].{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=213}} Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=214}} Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=217}}{{sfn|Puls|2006|p=227}} In that year's [[1796 United States presidential election|U.

The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=219}}\n\nSamuel Adams took a cue from President Washington, who declined to run for reelection in 1796: he retired from politics at the end of his term as governor in 1797.{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=218}} Adams suffered from what is now believed to have been [[essential tremor]], a movement disorder that rendered him unable to write in the final decade of his life.<ref>{{cite web| title = Samuel Adams' tremor | publisher = Neurology (2001) 56:1201\u201305 (online abstract) | author = Elan D.

Thomas Jefferson, for example, characterized Adams as \"truly the ''Man of the Revolution''.\"{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=5}} Leaders in other colonies were compared to him; [[Cornelius Harnett]] was called the \"Samuel Adams of North Carolina\", [[Charles Thomson]] the \"Samuel Adams of Philadelphia\",{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}} and [[Christopher Gadsden]] the \"Sam Adams of the South\".<ref>E. Stanly Godbold, \"Gadsden, Christopher\"; ''American National Biography Online'',  February 2000.</ref> When John Adams traveled to France during the Revolution, he had to explain that he was not Samuel, \"the famous Adams\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=3}}\n\nSupporters of the Revolution praised Adams, but Loyalists viewed him as a sinister figure. [[Peter Oliver (jurist)|Peter Oliver]], the exiled chief justice of Massachusetts, characterized him as a devious [[Machiavelli]]an with a \"cloven Foot\".{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=82}} Thomas Hutchinson, Adams' political foe, took his revenge in his ''History of Massachusetts Bay'', in which he denounced him as a dishonest character assassin, emphasizing his failures as a businessman and tax collector. This hostile \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams was revived in the 20th century by historian Clifford K. Shipton in the ''[[Harvard College#Sibley's Harvard Graduates|Sibley's Harvard Graduates]]'' reference series.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=83}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}} Shipton wrote positive portraits of Hutchinson and Oliver and scathing sketches of Adams and Hancock; his entry on Adams was characterized by historian [[Pauline Maier]] as \"forty-five pages of contempt\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}\n\nWhig historians challenged the \"Tory interpretation\" of Adams. William Gordon and [[Mercy Otis Warren]], two historians who knew Adams, wrote of him as a man selflessly dedicated to the American Revolution.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=84}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}} But in the early 19th century, Adams was often viewed as an old-fashioned Puritan, and was consequently neglected by historians.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}} Interest in Adams was revived in the mid-19th century. Historian [[George Bancroft]] portrayed him favorably in his monumental ''History of the United States from the Discovery of the American Continent'' (1852). The first full biography of Adams appeared in 1865, a three-volume work written by William Wells, his great-grandson.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=6}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=7}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} The Wells biography is still valuable for its wealth of information,<ref name=\"ANB\" /> although Whig portrayals of Adams were uncritically pro-American and had elements of [[hagiography]], a view that influenced some later biographies written for general audiences.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=85}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=92}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=229}}{{sfn|Alexander|2002|p=230}}\n\nIn the late 19th century, many American historians were uncomfortable with contemporary revolutions and found it problematic to write approvingly about Adams. Relations had improved between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and Adams' role in dividing Americans from Britons was increasingly viewed with regret.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=14}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=86}} In 1885, James Hosmer wrote a biography that praised Adams, but also found some of his actions troubling, such as the 1773 publication of Hutchinson's private letters.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=9}} Subsequent biographers became increasingly hostile towards Adams and the common people whom he represented. In 1923, Ralph V. Harlow used a \"[[Freudian]]\" approach to characterize Adams as a \"neurotic crank\" driven by an \"inferiority complex\".{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}}<ref>See Ralph V. Harlow, ''Samuel Adams, Promoter of the American Revolution: A Study in Psychology and Politics'' (Holt, 1923).</ref> Harlow argued that, because the masses were easily misled, Adams \"manufactured public opinion\" to produce the Revolution, a view that became the thesis of John C. Miller's 1936 biography ''Sam Adams: Pioneer in Propaganda''.{{sfn|Maier|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=91}} Miller portrayed Adams more as an incendiary revolutionary than an adroit political operative, attributing to this one man all the acts of Boston's \"body of the people\", and consistently calling his subject \"Sam\", despite the fact that Adams was almost always known as \"Samuel\" in his lifetime.<ref name=\"ANB\" />{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=58}}{{sfn|Raphael|2004|p=59}}\n\nMiller's influential book became, in the words of historian Charles Akers, the \"scholarly enshrinement\" of \"the myth of Sam Adams as the Boston dictator who almost single-handedly led his colony into rebellion\".<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 120\u201321.</ref> According to Akers, Miller and other historians used \"Sam did it\" to explain crowd actions and other developments, without citing any evidence that Adams directed those events.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 121\u201322.</ref> In 1974, Akers called on historians to critically re-examine the sources rather than simply repeating the myth.<ref>Akers, \"Sam Adams \u2013 And Much More\", 130.</ref> By then, scholars were increasingly rejecting the notion that Adams and others used \"propaganda\" to incite \"ignorant mobs\", and were instead portraying a revolutionary Massachusetts too complex to have been controlled by one man.{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=93}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=94}}{{sfn|O'Toole|1976|p=95}} Historian [[Pauline Maier]] argued that Adams, far from being a radical mob leader, took a moderate position based on the English revolutionary tradition that imposed strict constraints on resistance to authority. That belief justified force only against threats to the constitutional rights so grave that the \"body of the people\" recognized the danger, and only after all peaceful means of redress had failed. Within that revolutionary tradition, resistance was essentially conservative.

He appeared in the wake of the [[French New Wave]] alongside contemporaries like [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]. Demy's films are celebrated for their visual style. Demy's style drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the documentary realism of his New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by [[Michel Legrand]]) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Young Girls of Rochefort]]'' (1967).\n\n==Career==\nAfter working with the animator [[Paul Grimault]] and the filmmaker [[Georges Rouquier]], Demy directed ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'', his first feature film, in 1961, with [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] playing the eponymous cabaret singer. The Demy universe emerges here: Characters burst into song (courtesy of composer and lifelong Demy-collaborator [[Michel Legrand]]); iconic Hollywood imagery is appropriated, as in the opening scene with the man in a white Stetson in the Cadillac; plot is dictated by the director's fascination with fate and stock themes of chance encounters and long-lost love; and the setting, as with many of Demy's films, is the French Atlantic coast of his childhood, specifically the seaport town of Nantes.\n\n''[[La Baie des Anges]]'' (''The Bay of Angels'', 1963), starring [[Jeanne Moreau]], took the theme of fate further, with its story of love at the roulette tables.\n\nDemy is perhaps best known for his original musical ''[[Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]'' (''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'', 1964), with a score by Legrand. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demy's trademark visual style, shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail\u2014neckties, wallpaper, [[Catherine Deneuve]]'s bleached-blonde hair\u2014selected for visual impact. Roland Cassard, the young man from ''Lola'' ([[Marc Michel]]) reappears here, marrying Deneuve's character. Such reappearances are typical of Demy's work. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a huge fan of ''Les Parapluies'', writing in private correspondence: \"I saw ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That's all right. I like to have my heart broken.\"\n\nDemy's subsequent films never quite captured audience and critical acclaim the way ''Les Parapluies'' did, although he continued to make ambitious and original dramas and musicals. ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (1967), another whimsical-yet-melancholic musical, features Deneuve and her sister [[Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac]] as sisters living in the seaside town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], daughters of [[Danielle Darrieux]]. It was shot in color widescreen [[CinemaScope]] and featured an Oscar-nominated musical score as well as dance appearances by [[Gene Kelly]] and ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'''s [[George Chakiris]].\n\nIn 1968, after [[Columbia Pictures]] gave Demy a lucrative offer to shoot his first film in America, he and his wife, film director [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], moved to Los Angeles briefly. Demy's movie was a naturalistic drama: 1969's ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]''. Lola (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken a turn for the worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreau's character from ''Bay of Angels''), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child by working as a nude model in a backdoor model-shop on the [[Sunset Strip]]. She runs into an aimless, young architect ([[Gary Lockwood]]), who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life. ''Model Shop'' is a time capsule of late-1960s Los Angeles and documents the death of the hippie movement, the Vietnam draft, and the ennui and misery that results from broken relationships. This bleakness and decided lack of whimsy\u2014uncharacteristic for Demy\u2014had a large amount to do with ''Model Shop'''s critical and commercial failure.\n\n''[[Peau d'\u00c2ne]]'' (''Donkey Skin'', 1970) was a step in the opposite direction as a visually extravagant musical interpretation of a classic French fairy tale which highlights the tale's incestuous overtones, starring Deneuve, [[Jean Marais]], and [[Delphine Seyrig]]. It was Demy's first foray into the world of fairy tales and historical fantasia, which he explored in ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' and ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]].''\n\nAlthough none of Demy's subsequent films captured the contemporary success of his earlier work, some have been reappraised: [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote about \"the fascinating application of the operatic technique to an unusually dark story\" in ''[[Une chambre en ville]]'' (''A Room in Town'', 1982).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''[[L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement le plus important depuis que l'homme a march\u00e9 sur la lune]] (1973) (\"[[A Slightly Pregnant Man]]\")'' is a look back at the pressures of [[second-wave feminism]] in France and the fears it elicited in men. ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]]'' (1979), based on the Japanese manga series ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'', has been discussed and analyzed for its [[queer studies|queer]] and political subtext (the title character is born female, her father raises her as a male so she can get ahead in 18th-century French aristocracy, and she eventually falls in love with her surrogate brother, a working-class revolutionary).\n\n''Parapluies de Cherbourg'' has been color-restored twice from original prints by Demy. In 2014, [[The Criterion Collection]] released a boxed set of Demy's \"essential\" work, with hours of supplements, essays, and restored image and sound. The films include ''Lola'', ''Bay of Angels'', ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', ''The Young Girls of Rochefort'', ''Donkey Skin'', and ''Une Chambre en Ville'' as well as most of Demy's early short films.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAs a student, Demy did not learn any foreign languages. In the 1960s, with the help of some classes, internships, and spending some time in the United States, he learned English. At the time of the Anouchka project, which took many years to complete, he also learned Russian.<ref>T\u00e9moignage d'H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Demy dans ''L'Univers de Jacques Demy''. He admired his sister because she had become an English professor.</ref>\nIn the early 1970s, taking after the example of [[Michel Legrand]], he earned his [[Private pilot licence|private pilot\u2019s license]] for passenger planes.<ref>His pilot\u2019s license is presented in L'Univers de Jacques Demy.</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Jacques Demy and [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] met at a short film festival in Tours. The two married in 1962. They had a son together, [[Mathieu Demy]] (born 1972), and Demy also adopted Varda\u2019s daughter, [[Rosalie Varda]] (born 1958), whom she had with [[Antoine Bourseiller]] in a previous relationship.<ref>Mathilde Blotti\u00e8re, \u201cLes films de Jacques Demy enfin \u00e9dit\u00e9s en DVD\u201d, ''T\u00e9l\u00e9rama'', 15 November 2008.</ref> Together, Demy and Varda owned a home in Paris and another property with an old mill on the [[Noirmoutier|Noirmoutier Island]] in [[Vend\u00e9e]], where the shots of Demy on a beach in ''[[Jacquot de Nantes]] (1991)'' were taken. The film is a version of Demy's autobiographical notebooks, an account of Demy's childhood and his lifelong love of theatre and cinema. Varda paid homage to her husband in ''Jacquot de Nantes'', ''[[The Young Girls Turn 25|Les demoiselles ont eu 25 ans]]'' (1993), and ''L\u2019Univers de Jacques Demy'' (1995).\n\nDemy died on October 27, 1990 at the age of 59.<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Homay |date=2015 |title=Virtual Memory: Time-Based Art and the Dream of Digitality |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FdrDCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT81&pg=PT81#v=onepage&q=jacques%20demy%20aids |location=Durham, North Carolina, United States |publisher=Duke University Press |page= |isbn=082237515X}}</ref><ref>Interview, T\u00eatu, November 2008.</ref> Originally, it was reported that he died of [[cancer |Cancer]] <ref>Comme au cin\u00e9ma, 20 September 2005.</ref> It was not until 2008 that Varda revealed the true cause of his death, [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref> Mathilde Blotti\u00e8re, \u201cLes films de Jacques Demy enfin \u00e9dit\u00e9s en DVD\u201d, T\u00e9l\u00e9rama, 15 November 2008.</ref> Demy, before his death in 1990, did not want the real cause of his death to be revealed <ref>\u201cRencontre avec Agn\u00e8s Varda\u201d, lekinorama.com, 5 December 2008.</ref><ref>Madame Figaro, article from 29 March 2019.</ref> He was buried at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jacques Demy, Film Director, 59; Made 'Umbrellas of Cherbourg'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/30/obituaries/jacques-demy-film-director-59-made-umbrellas-of-cherbourg.html|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n* 1963 : [[Louis Delluc Prize]] for ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg|Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]''\n* 1964 : [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg|Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]''\n\n== Tribute ==\nOn 5 June 2019, on Demy's 88th birthday, he was honored with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/jacques-demys-88th-birthday|title=Jacques Demy\u2019s 88th Birthday|date=2019-06-05|website=Google|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Select filmography ==\n* ''Les horizons morts'' (short, 1951)\n* ''Le sabotier du Val de Loire'' (documentary short, 1956)\n* ''[[Le bel indiff\u00e9rent]]'' (short, 1957)\n* ''Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin'' (short, 1958)\n* ''La m\u00e8re et l'enfant'' (short, 1959)\n* ''[[Ars (film)|Ars]]'' (short, 1959)\n* ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'' (1961)\n* ''La Luxure'', episode in ''[[Les Sept p\u00e9ch\u00e9s capitaux]]'' (''The Seven Deadly Sins'') (1961)\n* ''[[La Baie des Anges]]'' (''Bay of Angels'') (1962)\n* ''[[Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]'' (''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'') (1964)\n* ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (''The Young Girls of Rochefort'') (1967)\n* ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]'' (1969)\n* ''[[Peau d'\u00c2ne]]'' (''Donkey Skin'') (1970)\n* ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' (1972)\n* ''[[L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement le plus important depuis que l'homme a march\u00e9 sur la lune]]'' (''The Slightly Pregnant Man'') (1973)\n* ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[La Naissance du Jour]]'' (made for TV, 1979)\n* ''[[Une chambre en ville]]'' (''A Room in Town'') (1982)\n* ''[[Parking (1985 film)|Parking]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[La table tournante]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Trois places pour le 26]]'' (''Three Seats for the 26th'') (1988)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[David Thomson (film critic)|Thomson, David]] (1975).

He appeared in the wake of the [[French New Wave]] alongside contemporaries like [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]. Demy's films are celebrated for their visual style. Demy's style drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the documentary realism of his New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by [[Michel Legrand]]) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Young Girls of Rochefort]]'' (1967).\n\n==Career==\nAfter working with the animator [[Paul Grimault]] and the filmmaker [[Georges Rouquier]], Demy directed ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'', his first feature film, in 1961, with [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] playing the eponymous cabaret singer. The Demy universe emerges here: Characters burst into song (courtesy of composer and lifelong Demy-collaborator [[Michel Legrand]]); iconic Hollywood imagery is appropriated, as in the opening scene with the man in a white Stetson in the Cadillac; plot is dictated by the director's fascination with fate and stock themes of chance encounters and long-lost love; and the setting, as with many of Demy's films, is the French Atlantic coast of his childhood, specifically the seaport town of Nantes.\n\n''[[La Baie des Anges]]'' (''The Bay of Angels'', 1963), starring [[Jeanne Moreau]], took the theme of fate further, with its story of love at the roulette tables.\n\nDemy is perhaps best known for his original musical ''[[Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]'' (''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'', 1964), with a score by Legrand. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demy's trademark visual style, shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail\u2014neckties, wallpaper, [[Catherine Deneuve]]'s bleached-blonde hair\u2014selected for visual impact. Roland Cassard, the young man from ''Lola'' ([[Marc Michel]]) reappears here, marrying Deneuve's character. Such reappearances are typical of Demy's work. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a huge fan of ''Les Parapluies'', writing in private correspondence: \"I saw ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That's all right. I like to have my heart broken.\"\n\nDemy's subsequent films never quite captured audience and critical acclaim the way ''Les Parapluies'' did, although he continued to make ambitious and original dramas and musicals. ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (1967), another whimsical-yet-melancholic musical, features Deneuve and her sister [[Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac]] as sisters living in the seaside town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], daughters of [[Danielle Darrieux]]. It was shot in color widescreen [[CinemaScope]] and featured an Oscar-nominated musical score as well as dance appearances by [[Gene Kelly]] and ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'''s [[George Chakiris]].\n\nIn 1968, after [[Columbia Pictures]] gave Demy a lucrative offer to shoot his first film in America, he and his wife, film director [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], moved to Los Angeles briefly. Demy's movie was a naturalistic drama: 1969's ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]''. Lola (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken a turn for the worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreau's character from ''Bay of Angels''), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child by working as a nude model in a backdoor model-shop on the [[Sunset Strip]]. She runs into an aimless, young architect ([[Gary Lockwood]]), who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life. ''Model Shop'' is a time capsule of late-1960s Los Angeles and documents the death of the hippie movement, the Vietnam draft, and the ennui and misery that results from broken relationships. This bleakness and decided lack of whimsy\u2014uncharacteristic for Demy\u2014had a large amount to do with ''Model Shop'''s critical and commercial failure.\n\n''[[Peau d'\u00c2ne]]'' (''Donkey Skin'', 1970) was a step in the opposite direction as a visually extravagant musical interpretation of a classic French fairy tale which highlights the tale's incestuous overtones, starring Deneuve, [[Jean Marais]], and [[Delphine Seyrig]]. It was Demy's first foray into the world of fairy tales and historical fantasia, which he explored in ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' and ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]].''\n\nAlthough none of Demy's subsequent films captured the contemporary success of his earlier work, some have been reappraised: [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote about \"the fascinating application of the operatic technique to an unusually dark story\" in ''[[Une chambre en ville]]'' (''A Room in Town'', 1982).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''[[L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement le plus important depuis que l'homme a march\u00e9 sur la lune]] (1973) (\"[[A Slightly Pregnant Man]]\")'' is a look back at the pressures of [[second-wave feminism]] in France and the fears it elicited in men. ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]]'' (1979), based on the Japanese manga series ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'', has been discussed and analyzed for its [[queer studies|queer]] and political subtext (the title character is born female, her father raises her as a male so she can get ahead in 18th-century French aristocracy, and she eventually falls in love with her surrogate brother, a working-class revolutionary).\n\n''Parapluies de Cherbourg'' has been color-restored twice from original prints by Demy. In 2014, [[The Criterion Collection]] released a boxed set of Demy's \"essential\" work, with hours of supplements, essays, and restored image and sound. The films include ''Lola'', ''Bay of Angels'', ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', ''The Young Girls of Rochefort'', ''Donkey Skin'', and ''Une Chambre en Ville'' as well as most of Demy's early short films.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAs a student, Demy did not learn any foreign languages. In the 1960s, with the help of some classes, internships, and spending some time in the United States, he learned English. At the time of the Anouchka project, which took many years to complete, he also learned Russian <ref>T\u00e9moignage d'H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Demy dans ''L'Univers de Jacques Demy''. He admired his sister because she had become an English professor.</ref>.\nIn the early 1970s, taking after the example of [[Michel Legrand]], he earned his [[Private pilot licence|private pilot\u2019s license]] for passenger planes <ref>His pilot\u2019s license is presented in L'Univers de Jacques Demy.</ref>.\n\nIn 1958, Jacques Demy and [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] met at a short film festival in Tours. The two married in 1962. They had a son together, [[Mathieu Demy]] (born 1972), and Demy also adopted Varda\u2019s daughter, [[Rosalie Varda]] (born 1958), whom she had with [[Antoine Bourseiller]] in a previous relationship<ref>Mathilde Blotti\u00e8re, \u201cLes films de Jacques Demy enfin \u00e9dit\u00e9s en DVD\u201d, ''T\u00e9l\u00e9rama'', 15 November 2008.</ref>. Together, Demy and Varda owned a home in Paris and another property with an old mill on the [[Noirmoutier|Noirmoutier Island]] in [[Vend\u00e9e]], where the shots of Demy on a beach in ''[[Jacquot de Nantes]] (1991)'' were taken. The film is a version of Demy's autobiographical notebooks, an account of Demy's childhood and his lifelong love of theatre and cinema. Varda paid homage to her husband in ''Jacquot de Nantes'', ''[[The Young Girls Turn 25|Les demoiselles ont eu 25 ans]]'' (1993), and ''L\u2019Univers de Jacques Demy'' (1995).\n\nDemy died on October 27, 1990 at the aged of 59<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Homay |date=2015 |title=Virtual Memory: Time-Based Art and the Dream of Digitality |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FdrDCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT81&pg=PT81#v=onepage&q=jacques%20demy%20aids |location=Durham, North Carolina, United States |publisher=Duke University Press |page= |isbn=082237515X}}</ref>,<ref>Interview, T\u00eatu, November 2008.</ref>.

Located on the east coast of South Africa, Durban is the busiest port in the country. It is also one of the major centres of tourism because of the city's warm [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate and extensive beaches.

These people lived throughout the area of present-day [[KwaZulu-Natal]] until the [[Bantu expansion|expansion of Bantu farmers and pastoralists]] from the north saw their gradual displacement, incorporation or extermination. \nLittle is known of the history of the first residents, as there is no [[Recorded history|written history]] of the area until it was sighted by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorer]] [[Vasco da Gama]], who sailed parallel to the KwaZulu-Natal coast at Christmastide in 1497 while searching for a route from Europe to [[India]]. He named the area \"Natal\", or Christmas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=walker1>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

Some of the survivors made their way to the Bay of Natal (Durban) where they were taken in by Abambo tribe under leadership of Chief Langalibale. The crew became fluent in the language of the tribe and witnessed their customs. They told that the land where the Abambo people lived was called Embo by the natives and that the people were very hospitable. On the 28th of October 1689 the galiot 'Noord' traveled from Table Bay to the Bay of Natal for the purpose to fetch the survivors of the crew and to negotiate a deal to purchase the bay. The Noord arrived on the 9th of December 1689 where after the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] purchased the Bay of Natal from the Abambo people for 1650\u00a3. A formal contract was drawn up by Laurens van Swaanswyk and signed by the Chief of the Abambo people, the crew of the Stavenisse acted as translators.<ref>History of South Africa 1486 - 1691, George McCall Theal, London 1888</ref>\n\n=== First European settlers ===\nIn 1822 Lieutenant James King, captain of the ship ''[[HMS Salisbury|Salisbury]]'', together with [[Francis Farewell|Lt. Francis George Farewell]], both ex-[[Royal Navy]] officers from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], were engaged in trade between the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a very bad storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went off well and they found safe anchor from the storm.\nLt. King decided to map the Bay and named the \"Salisbury and Farewell Islands\". In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson & Co., decided to open trade relations with [[Shaka]] the Zulu King and establish a trading station at the Bay. [[Henry Francis Fynn]], another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.\nFynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig ''Julia'', while Farewell followed six weeks later on the ''Antelope''. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, but only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn was able to befriend the King by helping him recover from a stab wound suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of Shaka's gratitude, he granted Fynn a \u201c25-mile strip of coast a hundred miles in depth.\u201d  On 7 August 1824 they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending ten miles south of the Bay, twenty-five miles north of the Bay and one hundred miles inland. \nFarewell took possession of this grant and raised the [[Union Jack]] with a Royal Salute, which consisted of 4 cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Of the original 18 would-be settlers, only 6 remained, and they can be regarded as the founding members of Port Natal as a British colony. These 6 were joined by Lt. James Saunders King and Nathaniel Isaacs in 1825.\n\nThe modern city of Durban thus dates from 1824 when the settlement was established on the northern shores of the bay near today's Farewell Square.<ref name=walker7>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

The force arrived on 4 May 1842 and built a fortification that was later to be ''The Old Fort''. On the night of 23/24 May 1842 the British attacked the Voortrekker camp at Congella. The attack failed, and the British had to withdraw to their camp which was put under siege. A local trader [[Dick King]] and his servant Ndongeni were able to escape the blockade and rode to [[Grahamstown]], a distance of {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} in fourteen days to raise reinforcements.

The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D\u2019Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the [[College of Arms]] in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D\u2019Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council's stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council's stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads \"Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur\"\u2014\"Better fortune follows a humble beginning\".\n\nThe blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979. The coat of arms fell into disuse with the re-organisation of the South African local government structure in 2000. The seal ceased to be used in 1995.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-kn-dur.html \n |title=Durban (South Africa) \u2013 Flags of the World \n |author=Bruce Berry \n |date=8 May 2006 \n |accessdate=8 July 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613221018/http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/FLAGS/za-kn-dur.html \n |archivedate=13 June 2010 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |title        = Durban \u2013 Civic Heraldry of South Africa\n |author       = Ralf Hartemink\n |accessdate   = 8 July 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205062839/http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |archive-date = 5 December 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Government  ==\n {{Further|eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|Mayors of Durban}}With the end of [[apartheid]], Durban was subject to restructuring of local government.

The mayor is elected for a five-year term; however Sipho Ngwenya only served two years. In 1996, the city became part of the ''Durban UniCity'' in July 1996 as part of transitional arrangements and to ''eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality'' in 1999, with the adoption of South Africa's new municipal governance system. In July 1996, [[Obed Mlaba]] was appointed mayor of Durban UniCity; in 1999 he was elected to mayor of the eThekwini municipality and re-elected in 2006.

Durban will be building a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that will be operational in October 2019, the [[Durban Cruise Terminal]]. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium.

These trains terminate at [[Durban railway station]].\n\n[[Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Durban and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network runs from Durban Station outwards as far as [[KwaDukuza, KwaZulu-Natal|Stanger]] on the north coast, [[Kelso, KwaZulu-Natal|Kelso]] on the south coast, and [[Cato Ridge, KwaZulu-Natal|Cato Ridge]] inland.\n\nA [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] has been proposed, between Johannesburg and Durban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html\n|accessdate=19 September 2010\n|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n[[File:DurbanN3-aerial.jpg|thumb|N3 freeway on its approach to Durban's CBD, with N2\u2013N3 [[stack interchange]] in the foreground]]\n\nThe city's main position as a [[port of entry]] onto the southern African continent has led to the development of [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] around it. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3 Western Freeway]], which links Durban with the economic hinterland of [[Gauteng]], heads west out of the city. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2 Outer Ring Road]] links Durban with the [[Eastern Cape]] to the south, and [[Mpumalanga]] in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the [[Witwatersrand]] for transfer to the port.\n\nThe N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The [[EB Cloete Interchange]] (which is informally nicknamed the [[Spaghetti Junction]]) lies to the east of Westville, allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 [[Durban Outer Ring Road|Outer Ring Road]] and the Western Freeway.\n\nThe N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the north coast to the south coast. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as [[Scottburgh]] and [[Stanger]]) that rely on Durban.\n\nDurban also has a system of freeway and [[Dual carriageway|dual arterial]] metropolitan routes, which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The [[M4 (Durban)|M4]] exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway, starts as an alternative highway at [[Ballito]] where it separates from the N2. It passes through the northern suburbs of [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]] and [[La Lucia]] where it becomes a [[dual carriageway]] and ends at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the [[Albert Lutuli]]<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/services/services_news/red-tar-for-southern-freeway]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Highway, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects with the N2 Outer Ring Road.\n\nThe [[M7 (Durban)|M7]] connects the southern industrial basin with the N3 and [[Pinetown]] via [[Queensburgh]] via the N2. The [[M19 (Durban)|M19]] connects the northern suburbs with Pinetown via [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]].\n\nThe [[M13 (Durban)|M13]] is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill). It also feeds traffic through [[Gillitts]], [[Kloof]], and Westville. In the Westville area it is called the [[Jan Smuts|Jan Smuts Highway]], while in the Kloof area it is named the [[Arthur Hopewell]] Highway.\n\nA number of streets in Durban were renamed in the late 2000s to the names of figures related to the anti-apartheid struggle, persons related to liberation movements around the world (including [[Che Guevara]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]] and [[SWAPO]]), and others associated with the governing [[African National Congress]].<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/renaming/Final%20Listt-%20Street%20Naming2.xls]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> A few street names were changed in the first round of renaming, followed by a larger second round.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |title=New road names go up \u2013 Politics &#124; IOL News |work=Independent Online |location=South Africa |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The renamings provoked incidents of vandalism,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Bainbridge |year=2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain/page/302 302] |title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-09-16|isbn=9781742203751 }}</ref> as well as protests from opposition parties<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050226/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view|date=5 November 2009}}</ref> and members of the public.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wines |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nSeveral companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa.

Located on the east coast of South Africa, Durban is the busiest port in the country. It is also one of the major centres of tourism because of the city's warm [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate and extensive beaches.

These people lived throughout the area of present-day [[KwaZulu-Natal]] until the [[Bantu expansion|expansion of Bantu farmers and pastoralists]] from the north saw their gradual displacement, incorporation or extermination. \nLittle is known of the history of the first residents, as there is no [[Recorded history|written history]] of the area until it was sighted by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorer]] [[Vasco da Gama]], who sailed parallel to the KwaZulu-Natal coast at Christmastide in 1497 while searching for a route from Europe to [[India]]. He named the area \"Natal\", or Christmas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=walker1>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

Some of the survivors made their way to the Bay of Natal (Durban) where they were taken in by Abambo tribe under leadership of Chief Langalibale. The crew became fluent in the language of the tribe and witnessed their customs. They told that the land where the Abambo people lived was called Embo by the natives and that the people were very hospitable. On the 28th of October 1689 the galiot 'Noord' traveled from Table Bay to the Bay of Natal for the purpose to fetch the survivors of the crew and to negotiate a deal to purchase the bay. The Noord arrived the 9th of December 1689 where after the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] purchased the Bay of Natal from the Abambo people for 1650\u00a3. A formal contract was drawn up by Laurens van Swaanswyk and signed by the Chief of the Abambo people, the crew of the Stavenisse acted as translators.<ref>History of South Africa 1486 - 1691, George McCall Theal, London 1888</ref>\n\n=== First European settlers ===\nIn 1822 Lieutenant James King, captain of the ship ''[[HMS Salisbury|Salisbury]]'', together with [[Francis Farewell|Lt. Francis George Farewell]], both ex-[[Royal Navy]] officers from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], were engaged in trade between the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] and [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. On a return trip to the Cape in 1823, they were caught in a very bad storm and decided to risk the Bar and anchor in the Bay of Natal. The crossing went off well and they found safe anchor from the storm.\nLt. King decided to map the Bay and named the \"Salisbury and Farewell Islands\". In 1824 Lt. Farewell, together with a trading company called J. R. Thompson & Co., decided to open trade relations with [[Shaka]] the Zulu King and establish a trading station at the Bay. [[Henry Francis Fynn]], another trader at Delagoa Bay, was also involved in this venture.\nFynn left Delagoa Bay and sailed for the Bay of Natal on the brig ''Julia'', while Farewell followed six weeks later on the ''Antelope''. Between them they had 26 possible settlers, but only 18 stayed. On a visit to King Shaka, Henry Francis Fynn was able to befriend the King by helping him recover from a stab wound suffered as a result of an assassination attempt by one of his half-brothers. As a token of Shaka's gratitude, he granted Fynn a \u201c25-mile strip of coast a hundred miles in depth.\u201d  On 7 August 1824 they concluded negotiations with King Shaka for a cession of land, including the Bay of Natal and land extending ten miles south of the Bay, twenty-five miles north of the Bay and one hundred miles inland. \nFarewell took possession of this grant and raised the [[Union Jack]] with a Royal Salute, which consisted of 4 cannon shots and twenty musket shots. Of the original 18 would-be settlers, only 6 remained, and they can be regarded as the founding members of Port Natal as a British colony. These 6 were joined by Lt. James Saunders King and Nathaniel Isaacs in 1825.\n\nThe modern city of Durban thus dates from 1824 when the settlement was established on the northern shores of the bay near today's Farewell Square.<ref name=walker7>{{cite book\n|title = A History of Southern Africa\n|author=Eric A.

The force arrived on 4 May 1842 and built a fortification that was later to be ''The Old Fort''. On the night of 23/24 May 1842 the British attacked the Voortrekker camp at Congella. The attack failed, and the British had to withdraw to their camp which was put under siege. A local trader [[Dick King]] and his servant Ndongeni were able to escape the blockade and rode to [[Grahamstown]], a distance of {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} in fourteen days to raise reinforcements.

The seal was produced in 1855 and was replaced in 1882. The new seal contained a coat of arms without helmet or mantling that combined the coats of arms of Sir Benjamin D\u2019Urban and Sir Benjamin Pine. An application was made to register the coat of arms with the [[College of Arms]] in 1906, but this application was rejected on grounds that the design implied that D\u2019Urban and Pine were husband and wife. Nevertheless, the coat of arms appeared on the council's stationery from about 1912. The following year, a helmet and mantling was added to the council's stationery and to the new city seal that was made in 1936. The motto reads \"Debile principium melior fortuna sequitur\"\u2014\"Better fortune follows a humble beginning\".\n\nThe blazon of the arms registered by the South African Bureau of Heraldry and granted to Durban on 9 February 1979. The coat of arms fell into disuse with the re-organisation of the South African local government structure in 2000. The seal ceased to be used in 1995.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-kn-dur.html \n |title=Durban (South Africa) \u2013 Flags of the World \n |author=Bruce Berry \n |date=8 May 2006 \n |accessdate=8 July 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613221018/http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/FLAGS/za-kn-dur.html \n |archivedate=13 June 2010 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |title        = Durban \u2013 Civic Heraldry of South Africa\n |author       = Ralf Hartemink\n |accessdate   = 8 July 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205062839/http://www.ngw.nl/int/zaf/d/durban.htm\n |archive-date = 5 December 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Government  ==\n {{Further|eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|Mayors of Durban}}With the end of [[apartheid]], Durban was subject to restructuring of local government. The [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] was formed in 1994 after South Africa's first multiracial elections, with its first mayor being [[Sipho Ngwenya]]. The mayor is elected for a five-year term; however Sipho Ngwenya only served two years. In 1996, the city became part of the ''Durban UniCity'' in July 1996 as part of transitional arrangements and to ''eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality'' in 1999, with the adoption of South Africa's new municipal governance system. In July 1996, [[Obed Mlaba]] was appointed mayor of Durban UniCity; in 1999 he was elected to mayor of the eThekwini municipality and re-elected in 2006. Following the May 2011 local elections, James Nxumalo, the former Speaker of the Council, was elected as the new mayor.

Durban will be building a brand new R200 million cruise terminal that will be operational in October 2019, the [[Durban Cruise Terminal]]. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd which is 70% owned by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium.

These trains terminate at [[Durban railway station]].\n\n[[Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Durban and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network runs from Durban Station outwards as far as [[KwaDukuza, KwaZulu-Natal|Stanger]] on the north coast, [[Kelso, KwaZulu-Natal|Kelso]] on the south coast, and [[Cato Ridge, KwaZulu-Natal|Cato Ridge]] inland.\n\nA [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] has been proposed, between Johannesburg and Durban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html\n|accessdate=19 September 2010\n|title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Roads ===\n[[File:DurbanN3-aerial.jpg|thumb|N3 freeway on its approach to Durban's CBD, with N2\u2013N3 [[stack interchange]] in the foreground]]\n\nThe city's main position as a [[port of entry]] onto the southern African continent has led to the development of [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] around it. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3 Western Freeway]], which links Durban with the economic hinterland of [[Gauteng]], heads west out of the city. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2 Outer Ring Road]] links Durban with the [[Eastern Cape]] to the south, and [[Mpumalanga]] in the north. The Western Freeway is particularly important because freight is shipped by truck to and from the [[Witwatersrand]] for transfer to the port.\n\nThe N3 Western Freeway starts in the central business district and heads west under Tollgate Bridge and through the suburbs of Sherwood and Mayville. The [[EB Cloete Interchange]] (which is informally nicknamed the [[Spaghetti Junction]]) lies to the east of Westville, allowing for transfer of traffic between the N2 [[Durban Outer Ring Road|Outer Ring Road]] and the Western Freeway.\n\nThe N2 Outer Ring Road cuts through the city from the north coast to the south coast. It provides a vital link to the coastal towns (such as [[Scottburgh]] and [[Stanger]]) that rely on Durban.\n\nDurban also has a system of freeway and [[Dual carriageway|dual arterial]] metropolitan routes, which connect the sprawling suburbs that lie to the north, west and south of the city. The [[M4 (Durban)|M4]] exists in two segments. The northern segment, named the Ruth First Highway, starts as an alternative highway at [[Ballito]] where it separates from the N2. It passes through the northern suburbs of [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga]] and [[La Lucia]] where it becomes a [[dual carriageway]] and ends at the northern edge of the CBD. The southern segment of the M4, the [[Albert Lutuli]]<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/services/services_news/red-tar-for-southern-freeway]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> Highway, starts at the southern edge of the CBD, connecting through to the old, decommissioned Durban International Airport, where it once again reconnects with the N2 Outer Ring Road.\n\nThe [[M7 (Durban)|M7]] connects the southern industrial basin with the N3 and [[Pinetown]] via [[Queensburgh]] via the N2. The [[M19 (Durban)|M19]] connects the northern suburbs with Pinetown via [[Westville, KwaZulu-Natal|Westville]].\n\nThe [[M13 (Durban)|M13]] is an untolled alternative to the N3 Western Freeway (which is tolled at Mariannhill). It also feeds traffic through [[Gillitts]], [[Kloof]], and Westville. In the Westville area it is called the [[Jan Smuts|Jan Smuts Highway]], while in the Kloof area it is named the [[Arthur Hopewell]] Highway.\n\nA number of streets in Durban were renamed in the late 2000s to the names of figures related to the anti-apartheid struggle, persons related to liberation movements around the world (including [[Che Guevara]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]] and [[SWAPO]]), and others associated with the governing [[African National Congress]].<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/renaming/Final%20Listt-%20Street%20Naming2.xls]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> A few street names were changed in the first round of renaming, followed by a larger second round.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/new-road-names-go-up-1.406687 |title=New road names go up \u2013 Politics &#124; IOL News |work=Independent Online |location=South Africa |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The renamings provoked incidents of vandalism,<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Bainbridge |year=2009 |url=https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/southafricalesot0000bain/page/302 302] |title=South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-09-16|isbn=9781742203751 }}</ref> as well as protests from opposition parties<ref>[http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050226/http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/media/cmn/cmnitem.2007-05-06.2303123121/view|date=5 November 2009}}</ref> and members of the public.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wines |first=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nSeveral companies run long-distance bus services from Durban to the other cities in South Africa.
