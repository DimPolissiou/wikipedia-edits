His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me.

He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|\"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric\"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> The film is ranked 35th on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} \"100 Best Movies\" and fourth on the AFI list of the \"100 Best Comedies.\"\n\n''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

''[[Stardust Memories]]'' was based on ''[[8\u00bd]]'', which it parodies, and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. Allen uses many elements from ''Wild Strawberries''.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

The film is similar to the 1942 film ''Larceny, Inc.'' (from a play by S.J.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as [[Charlie Chaplin|\"Chaplinesque\"]] and \"refreshing\".\n\nAllen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.

Feldman]] production ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' (1965), for which he wrote the screenplay. He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

''Annie Hall'' (1977) won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|\"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric\"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> The film is ranked 35th on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} \"100 Best Movies\" and fourth on the AFI list of the \"100 Best Comedies.\"\n\n''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else. He's bold. He's got a lot of strength, a lot of courage in terms of his work. And that is what it takes to do something really unique. Along with a genius imagination.\"<ref name=Couric />\n\n=== 1980s ===\nAllen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, and are influenced by European directors, specifically [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' was based on ''[[8\u00bd]]'', which it parodies, and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. Allen uses many elements from ''Wild Strawberries''. In ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', Allen references a scene from ''Wild Strawberries''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilmington|first1=Michael|title=rectors (Page 2 of 2) COMMENTARY : Woody Allen Keeps the Faith : 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' tears down the wall between his serious and comic sides (Page 2)|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-22/entertainment/ca-984_1_woody-allen-movie/2|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 13, 2016|date=October 22, 1989}}</ref>\n\n''Stardust Memories'' (1980) features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans.

In 1989 Allen and directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] made ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

''Small Time Crooks'' was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically, but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]'' (with a budget of $26 million).

His first great success was ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]]. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]], although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''[[God (play)|God]]'' and ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''[[Without Feathers]]''. In 1981 Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' opened on Broadway. It was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two [[Tony Award]] nominations, a Tony win for the acting of [[Brian Backer]] (who won the 1981 [[Theater World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theatre in 1995 with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theatre, ''Death Defying Acts'', that also included new work by [[David Mamet]] and [[Elaine May]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune \u2013 David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224171536/http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |archive-date=February 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the next few years Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, but notable productions of his work were staged.

''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

Tatler founded the band along with schoolmate Duncan Scott, playing on a cheap fuzz guitar and Scott on some biscuit tins. They later enrolled the help of Sean Harris and Colin Kimberley on vocals and bass guitar respectively.\n\nThe band played a few local gigs and recorded two self-financed demo tapes in 1979. Although only recorded in six hours on a four-track (a copy was sent to Geoff Barton from Sounds) they gained enough attention to tour as support with [[AC/DC]] and open for [[Iron Maiden]] in London.

The manager decided that they would press a thousand white label copies of their debut album to sell mail order though Sounds and at gigs. This album came in a plain sleeve with no title, having on it only a signature of one of the band members and no track listings.

Their \"major label\" status afforded them a slot on the Reading Festival bill in 1982.

Tatler has expressed since that making this album was one of the most stressful periods of his life, and the entire process almost caused him to have a nervous breakdown. He also said that making the decision to fire his best friend Duncan Scott from the band was one of the hardest things he has had to do.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In hindsight Brian has said that its was a terrible shame that Diamond Head split in half during the recording of the Canterbury album (Duncan was fired and Colin quit the band) We should have said the band is more important than the album, not the other way round. \n\nThe band split completely in 1985. Around the same time, Tatler also decided that it was time to retire his signature white [[Flying V]] and convert to a [[Gibson Les Paul]] His white 1979 Gibson Flying V broke five times at the top of the neck and Brian decided it was too fragile to take on the road. He said the Les Paul was a way more solid guitar capable of being dropped and not breaking. Brian now owns three Gibson Les Paul Standards that are used for recording and gigs plus he uses a black 2016 Gibson Flying V for live work \"I take the V if we are driving but if we are flying I will take a Les Paul\".\n\n==1990s==\n\n===Radio Moscow===\nAfter Diamond Head split, Tatler went on to run a 24track studio called RPK in [[Lye, West Midlands|Lye]], recording and producing local bands between 1985 and 1990. He also formed the band Radio Moscow (not to be confused with the modern American blues-rock band of the same name) Radio Moscow recorded two albums, (''World Service'' and ''Get A New Life'') both of which featured Ritch Battersby on drums, who later went on to perform with The Wildhearts. Brian co-wrote all the songs and played guitar on \"World Service\" but fell out with the studio owner (Ex Diamond Head manager Reg Fellows) and so was replaced in the band in 1990. Brian played no part in the follow up album.\n\n===First Diamond Head reunion===\nPete Winkelman suggested to Tatler that he reforms Diamond Head with Sean Harris in 1990. Brian signed to Warner/Chappell publishing (who Sean was already signed to from the \"Notorious\" debacle) and the pair began writing new material. Their fourth album ''[[Death and Progress]]'' was originally intended to be released on East/West but after two years and a lot of complications the album was eventually released on Castle Communications in 1993. Unfortunately the reunion was short lived and the band split again in 1994.\n\n==Modern Day==\n\n===Quill===\nAfter the split, Tatler joined [[Thin Lizzy]] tribute act, Dizzy Lizzy, before joining up with the [[Celtic rock]] band, Quill in 1997. During his time with Quill, Tatler recorded three albums (''Out of the hat'', ''Privileged'' and ''Back Intact''). Brian also played with Tribute bands Jean Genie and Limehouse Lizzy.\n\n===Diamond Head's acoustic years and Nick Tart era===\n[[File:Abbz.jpg|thumb|left|Andy Abberley and Brian Tatler 2008]]\nTatler played his last show with Quill in November 2000, and teamed up with Harris and Stourbridge guitarist/singer Floyd Brennan to perform and record an acoustic version of Diamond Head songs. Also during this time, Tatler collaborated with [[Dave Mustaine]] of [[Megadeth]] on an album together. This project was shelved and never released. In 2002 an offer to play the Metal Meltdown IV Festival in New Jersey prompted Tatler & Harris to put an electric band together recruiting Karl Wilcox (drums) and Eddie Moohan (bass). Diamond Head played their first gig in North America. Work began on a new album called Host however it was never released. Harris' reluctance to tour as Diamond Head and suggested a name change. Tatler was not interested in changing the name from Diamond Head to Host so a power struggle developed until Tatler eventually sacked Harris and bought in another singer. \n\nEnter Nick Tart from Cannock in the West Midlands who sang on Diamond Head's fifth studio album, ''[[All Will Be Revealed]]'', which was released through Cargo Records in 2005.

only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but a recent study shows the [[Pharynx|pharynx]] infection reached peak [[Viral load|viral load]] after approximately four days on average.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural reservoir]]s of SARS-CoV-2]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\"

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CCDC) and other institutions;<ref name=\"gisaid\"/><ref name=\"VirologicalInitial\" /> the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a [[common ancestor]]\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> {{As of|2020|March|27|post=,}} 1,495 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.<ref name=\"NextstrainMarch\" />\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five [[conserved sequence]]s of [[nucleic acid]]s, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak]] were insufficient to make them separate [[viral species]]. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]''.<ref name=\"CoronavirusStudyGroup\" />\n\n===Structural biology===\n[[File:Coronavirus virion structure.svg|alt=Figure of a spherical SARSr-CoV virion showing locations of structural proteins forming the viral envelope and the inner nucleocapsid|thumb|right|Structure of a SARSr-CoV virion]]\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 [[virion]] is approximately 50\u2013200 [[nanometre]]s in diameter.<ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N ([[nucleocapsid]]) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the [[viral envelope]].<ref name=\"WuStructure\" /> The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using [[cryogenic electron microscopy]],<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"GZM-20200220\" /> is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a host cell.<ref name=\"WuStructure\" />\n\n[[File:6VSB spike protein SARS-CoV-2 monomer in homotrimer.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=SARS-CoV-2 spike homotrimer with one protein subunit highlighted; ACE2 binding domain highlighted|SARS-CoV-2 spike [[homotrimer]] with one [[protein subunit]] highlighted; ACE2 [[binding domain]] in magenta]]\n\n[[Protein structure prediction|Protein modeling]] experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of [[Viral entry|cell entry]].<ref name=\"SCLSModeling\" /> By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using [[reverse genetics]] methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"Letko22Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"NatMicLetko\" /><ref name=\"ElSahly\" /> Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"NIH-Structure\" /> SARS-CoV-2 may also use [[basigin]] to assist in cell entry.<ref name=\"CD147\" />\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = SARS-CoV-2 49531042877.jpg | alt1 = SARS-CoV-2 emerging from a human cell | image2 = SARS-CoV-2 scanning electron microscope image.jpg | alt2 = SARS-CoV-2 virions emerging from a human cell | footer_align = center | footer = Digitally colourised [[Micrograph|electron micrographs]] of SARS-CoV-2 virions (yellow) emerging from human cells [[Cell culture|cultured]] in a laboratory}}\n\nInitial spike protein priming by [[TMPRSS2|transmembrane protease, serine 2]] (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" /> After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's [[protease]] TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a [[fusion peptide]].

Published every year by the [[Roman Curia]], the ''Annuario Pontificio'' attaches no consecutive numbers to the popes, stating that it is impossible to decide which side represented at various times the legitimate succession, in particular regarding [[Pope Leo VIII]], [[Pope Benedict V]] and some mid-11th-century popes.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2012'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 12*</ref> The 2001 edition of the ''Annuario Pontificio'' introduced \"almost 200 corrections to its existing biographies of the popes, from St Peter to John Paul II\".

This title in English usage usually refers to the head of the Catholic Church. The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including ''[[Supreme Pontiff|Summus Pontifex]]'', ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', and ''[[Servus servorum Dei]]''. Each title has been added by unique historical events and unlike other papal prerogatives, is not incapable of modification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12260a.htm#V |title=Papal Primacy of honour: titles and insignia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1911 |accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Hermannus Contractus]] may have been the first historian to number the popes continuously. His list ends in 1049 with [[Pope Leo IX]] as number 154. Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century. [[Antipope Christopher]] was considered legitimate for a long time. [[Pope-elect Stephen]] was considered legitimate under the name ''Stephen II'' until the 1961 edition, when his name was erased. Although these changes are no longer controversial, a number of modern lists still include this \"first Pope Stephen II\". It is probable that this is because they are based on the 1913 edition of the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', which is in the public domain.\n\nA significant number of these popes have been [[List of canonised popes|recognized as saints]], including 48 out of the first 50 consecutive popes, and others are in the sainthood process.

Popes with unique names are not identified by ordinals. Antipopes are treated as [[pretenders]], and their numbers are reused by true popes. However, there are anomalies in the numbering of the popes. Several numbers were mistakenly increased in the Middle Ages because the records were misunderstood. Several antipopes were also kept in the sequence, either by mistake or because they were previously considered to be true popes.\n\n* Donus: The name has only been used by one pope. The apocryphal [[Pope Donus II]] resulted from confusion between the Latin word ''dominus'' (lord) and the name Donus.\n* Felix: [[Antipope Felix II]] (356\u2013357) was kept in the numbering sequence.<ref name=\"ceanti\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Antipope}}</ref>\n* John: The [[Pope John numbering|numbering of the Johns]] is particularly confused.

The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including ''[[Supreme Pontiff|Summus Pontifex]]'', ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', and ''[[Servus servorum Dei]]''.

His list ends in 1049 with [[Pope Leo IX]] as number 154. Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century. [[Antipope Christopher]] was considered legitimate for a long time. [[Pope-elect Stephen]] was considered legitimate under the name ''Stephen II'' until the 1961 edition, when his name was erased. Although these changes are no longer controversial, a number of modern lists still include this \"first Pope Stephen II\". It is probable that this is because they are based on the 1913 edition of the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', which is in the public domain.\n\nA significant number of these popes have been [[List of canonised popes|recognized as saints]], including 48 out of the first 50 consecutive popes, and others are in the sainthood process.

Popes with unique names are not identified by ordinals. Antipopes are treated as [[pretenders]], and their numbers are reused by true popes. However, there are anomalies in the numbering of the popes. Several numbers were mistakenly increased in the Middle Ages because the records were misunderstood. Several antipopes were also kept in the sequence, either by mistake or because they were previously considered to be true popes.\n\n* Donus: The name has only been used by one pope. The apocryphal [[Pope Donus II]] resulted from confusion between the Latin word ''dominus'' (lord) and the name Donus.\n* Felix: [[Antipope Felix II]] (356\u2013357) was kept in the numbering sequence.ref name=\"ceanti\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Antipope}}</ref>\n* John: The [[Pope John numbering|numbering of the Johns]] is particularly confused. In the modern sequence, the Johns are identified by the numbers they used during their reigns.\n** [[Antipope John XVI]] (997\u2013998) was kept in the numbering sequence.\n** [[Pope John XXI]] (1276\u20131277) chose to skip the number XX, believing that there had been another John between XIV and XV. In reality, John XIV had been counted twice.<ref name=\"cechron\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Chronological Lists of Popes}}</ref>\n** By the 16th century, the numbering error had been conflated with legends about a female [[Pope Joan]], whom some authors called John VIII. She was never listed in the ''Annuario Pontificio''.<ref name=\"ceJoan\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Popess Joan}}</ref>\n** [[Antipope John XXIII]] (1410\u20131415) was listed in the ''Annuario Pontificio'' as a legitimate pope until the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Roman Curia |title=Annuario Pontificio per l'Anno 1942 |date=1942 |location=Rome |page=21 |quote=207. Giovanni XXII o XXIII o XXIV, Napoletano}}</ref> John XXIII became an antipope when [[Pope John XXIII]] (1958\u20131963) chose to reuse the number, citing \"twenty-two [sic] Johns of indisputable legitimacy.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=I Choose John ... |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938062,00.html |work=Time |date=10 November 1958 | page=91}}</ref>\n* Martin: [[Pope Martin I]] (649\u2013655) is followed by Martin IV (1281\u20131285). Due to the similarity between the Latin names ''Marinus'' and ''Martinus'', [[Pope Marinus I|Marinus&nbsp;I]] and [[Pope Marinus II|Marinus&nbsp;II]] were mistakenly considered to be Martin II and III.<ref name=\"cemartin\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Pope Martin IV}}</ref>\n* Stephen: [[Pope-elect Stephen]] (752) died before being consecrated. He was previously known as Stephen II, but the Vatican removed him from the official list of popes in 1961.<ref name=\"cechron\" /> The remaining Stephens are now numbered [[Pope Stephen II]] (752\u2013757) to [[Pope Stephen IX]] (1057\u20131058).\n\nThose who adhere to [[Sedevacantism]] say that there have been no legitimate popes since Pius XII or John XXIII. This is because they consider all popes since the [[Second Vatican Council]] to be [[heretic]]s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yUqp1_31B-MC&pg=PA257&dq=Sedevacantism#v=onepage&q=Sedevacantism&f=false Weaver, MJ., and Appleby, RS., ''Being Right: Conservative Catholics in America'', Indiana University Press, 1 January 1995, p. 257.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gxEONS0FFlsC&pg=PA566&dq=Sedevacantism#v=onepage&q=Sedevacantism&f=false Flinn, FK., ''Encyclopedia of Catholicism'', 2007, p. 566.]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n\n=== Lists ===\n*[[List of ages of popes]]\n*[[List of canonised popes]]\n*[[List of murdered popes]]\n*[[List of popes by nationality]]\n*[[List of popes from the Borgia family]]\n*[[List of popes from the Conti family]]\n*[[List of popes from the Medici family]]\n*[[:Category:Popes|List of popes sorted alphabetically]]\n*[[List of sexually active popes]]\n*[[List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State]]\n*[[List of Popes (graphical)]]\n{{Col-break}}\n\n=== Related topics ===\n\n*[[Annuario Pontificio]]\n*[[History of the papacy]]\n*[[Index of Vatican City-related articles]]\n*[[Legends surrounding the papacy]]\n*[[Liber Pontificalis]]\n*[[Papal name]]\n*[[Papal appointment]]\n*[[Pope John (numbering)]]\n*[[Prophecy of the Popes]]\n{{col-end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Specific ===\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General ===\n\n* ''The Early Papacy: To the Synod of Chalcedon in 451'', Adrian Fortescue, Ignatius Press, 2008.\n* ''The Oxford Dictionary of Popes'', John N.D.
