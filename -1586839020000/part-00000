Watson advertisement, 1923]]Dr. Thomas Boswell Watson (1815\u20131860), from [[Scotland]], was the first member of the Watson family to arrive in the [[Far East]], where in 1845 he set up a private practice in [[Macau]], on the southwest coast of China.<ref name=\"RASHK\">{{cite journal|url=http://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/8deeba7475f950a5f3938fc24f687bbe.pdf|title=Hongs Kong's Hongs with Long Histories and British Connections|author=Dan Waters|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|year=1990|volume=30|pages=219\u2013256|issn=1991\u20137295}} p. 221</ref> After selling his practice to a fellow doctor, he moved to Hong Kong in 1856 where he became part owner of the Hong Kong Dispensary, an offshoot of the [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] Dispensary which operated from 1828 to 1858. \n\nKnown as the \"Big Medicine Shop\" ({{zh|t=\u5927\u85e5\u623f}}; [[Cantonese]]: ''Dai Yeuk Fong''), the dispensary's main customers were soldiers and sailors. The dispensary was not known as A.S. Watson until 1870, although Alexander Skirving Watson took over in 1858 following management changes.<ref name=\"RASHK\"/> T. B. Watson sent his family back to Scotland in 1857, and he himself followed two years later.\n\nFollowing the death of Dr T. B. Watson in 1860, the Hong Kong Dispensary was leased to A. S. Watson and two other doctors, and onwards from 1862, the name A.S. Watson featured prominently at the Hong Kong Dispensary. In 1871, the Watson family leased the company to [[John David Humphreys|Dr John David Humphreys]] and Dr Arthur Hunt, and thereafter trading was executed under the name A.S. Watson & Company. \n\nRetail outlets were known as \"Watsons the Chemist\". The current owners, Hutchison Group, acquired a controlling interest in A.S. Watson & Co., Ltd in 1963. In 1981, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. At this time, the group had 75 retail outlets.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:HK Plaza Hollywood Watsons Store.jpg|Branch in [[Plaza Hollywood]], [[Diamond Hill]], [[Kowloon]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:HK QRC Watsons Your Personal Store.JPG|Branch in [[Queen's Road Central]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:Watsons Baby Store in Shatin Centre 2013.jpg|Watsons Baby Store Branch in [[Shatin Centre]], [[Shatin]], [[New Territories]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:BEAUTIQ by Watsons 2015.jpg|BEAUTIQ by Watsons Branch in [[Shatin]], [[New Territories]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:Wastsons Shijie Store 20070331.jpg|Branch in [[Shilin Station]], [[Shilin District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:Wastson-tainan.jpg|Branch in [[Tainan|Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:Watson's Pharmacy, Dihua Street 20060225.jpg|Historical remains of Watsons Pharmacy in [[Dihua Street]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:WatsonsstoreinChengdu.jpg|Watsons store in [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], [[China]]\nFile:Watsons i SM Aura, BGC.jpg|Branch in [[SM Aura Premier]], [[Fort Bonifacio|Bonifacio Global City]], [[Taguig]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]\nFile:Watsons SM City Sucat storefront.jpg|Branch in [[SM City Sucat]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Watsons shops|Watsons Personal Care Stores}}\n* [http://www.watsonsasia.com/ Customer website]\n* [http://www.aswatson.com/eng/html/index.html A.S.

Watson advertisement, 1923]]Dr. Thomas Boswell Watson (1815\u20131860), from [[Scotland]], was the first member of the Watson family to arrive in the [[Far East]], where in 1845 he set up a private practice in [[Macau]], on the southwest coast of China.<ref name=\"RASHK\">{{cite journal|url=http://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/8deeba7475f950a5f3938fc24f687bbe.pdf|title=Hongs Kong's Hongs with Long Histories and British Connections|author=Dan Waters|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|year=1990|volume=30|pages=219\u2013256|issn=1991\u20137295}} p. 221</ref> After selling his practice to a fellow doctor, he moved to Hong Kong in 1856 where he became part owner of the Hong Kong Dispensary, an offshoot of the [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] Dispensary which operated from 1828 to 1858. \n\nKnown as the \"Big Medicine Shop\" ({{zh|t=\u5927\u85e5\u623f}}; [[Cantonese]]: ''Dai Yeuk Fong''), the dispensary's main customers were soldiers and sailors. The dispensary was not known as A.S. Watson until 1870, although Alexander Skirving Watson took over in 1858 following management changes.<ref name=\"RASHK\"/> T. B. Watson sent his family back to Scotland in 1857, and he himself followed two years later.\n\nFollowing the death of Dr T. B. Watson in 1860, the Hong Kong Dispensary was leased to A. S. Watson and two other doctors, and onwards from 1862, the name A.S. Watson featured prominently at the Hong Kong Dispensary. In 1871, the Watson family leased the company to [[John David Humphreys|Dr John David Humphreys]] and Dr Arthur Hunt, and thereafter trading was executed under the name A.S. Watson & Company. \n\nRetail outlets were known as \"Watsons the Chemist\". The current owners, Hutchison Group, acquired a controlling interest in A.S. Watson & Co., Ltd in 1963. In 1981, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. At this time, the group had 75 retail outlets.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:HK Plaza Hollywood Watsons Store.jpg|Branch in [[Plaza Hollywood]], [[Diamond Hill]], [[Kowloon]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:HK QRC Watsons Your Personal Store.JPG|Branch in [[Queen's Road Central]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:Watsons Baby Store in Shatin Centre 2013.jpg|Watsons Baby Store Branch in [[Shatin Centre]], [[Shatin]], [[New Territories]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:BEAUTIQ by Watsons 2015.jpg|BEAUTIQ by Watsons Branch in [[Shatin]], [[New Territories]], [[Hong Kong]]\nFile:Wastsons Shijie Store 20070331.jpg|Branch in [[Shilin Station]], [[Shilin District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:Wastson-tainan.jpg|Branch in [[Tainan|Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:Watson's Pharmacy, Dihua Street 20060225.jpg|Historical remains of Watsons Pharmacy in [[Dihua Street]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]\nFile:WatsonsstoreinChengdu.jpg|Watsons store in [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], [[China]]\nFile:Watsons i SM Aura, BGC.jpg|Branch in [[SM Aura Premier]], [[Fort Bonifacio|Bonifacio Global City]], [[Taguig]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]\nFile:Watsons SM City Sucat storefront.jpg|Branch in [[SM City Sucat]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Watsons shops|Watsons Personal Care Stores}}\n* [http://www.watsonsasia.com/ Customer website]\n* [http://www.aswatson.com/eng/html/index.html A.S.

Although both were originally schools, many alumni have made significant contributions to the Nation, in politics, in academia, education and health services, in business and as musicians and artists and thugs->(they're not in the book though).  Many are mentioned in the book.\n\nThere is also Mainly About Girls, A History of Queen\u2019s, Ballarat 1876 \u2013 1972 written by Susanne White and Winds of Influence, A History of Ballarat Grammar 1911 \u2013 1971 by Michael Boyle.

The expansive campus stretches as far north as No I Won't Do Anything About The Bullying St, and west towards I Dare You To Bully That Kid St. Both the ''Senior School'' and ''Junior School'' are situated on the saem campus, sharing many facilities and resources. ''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts'' is accessed by students via the sun part of the campus, and by the general public via Hit St.\n\n''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts (WCPA)'' was opened in 2006 through a partnership between the School and the wider Ballarat Community. The main auditorium seats 857 and the expansive stage area has the capacity to handle a range of performances. It is used by the School and also hosts community events and performances. Ballarat Grammar's ''Music School'' is located within the WCPA, featuring tutorial and rehearsal rooms, and a professional recording suite. The WCPA also features natural cooling using the catacombs and natural air-flow.\n\n''The Heinz Centre'' is an award-winning (2002 BEN Environment Award<ref name=\"ENDAward1\">[http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards 2002 BEN Environment Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811074454/http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards |date=11 August 2008 }} (accessed:20-07-2008)</ref> ) Year 9 Environmental Centre, opened in 2001.

The Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) crews compete in the annual \"Head of the Lake\", which is held at [[Lake Wendouree]].\n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Australian Rules Football team has had great success in recent years, winning the Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) Premiership every year since 2013. Coached by teacher Matt Hanlon, the team was first successful in the AFL Victoria Herald Sun Shield (HSS) Championship in 2014, where they claimed the School Girls Division 1 title. In 2015, the girls contested against [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies College]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] but lost in a close match, however, it is worthy to note that the best on the ground for that game was Rene Caris who was drafted to the Geelong Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft. In 2016 and 2017, the Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Football team triumphed in the Herald Sun Shield claiming Division 1 titles in successive years at RAMS Arena and the MCG respectfully. In 2017, Lauren Butler, who was drafted to the Collingwood Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft, was named best on the ground in the Herald Sun Shield Grand final. In 2018, the team was unsuccessful in the Herald Sun Shield Grand final, where they were beaten by Hallam Secondary College at GMHBA Stadium, Geelong. \n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Athletic team has in recent years been successful, with the Senior Boys Athletics Team taking out 2012 All Schools Knockout title.\n\n==House system==\n\nThe [[house system]] is very important to the structure of the school, and there is a lack of substantial rivalry between houses in swimming, athletics, choral competitions, and more. The house system also does not provides pastoral care and a degree of mentoring to students.  The rivalry is particularly seen between the two boys' boarding houses, Dart and Wigan, which often used to engage in pranks against each other. This practice was abandoned in 2007 after a new administration deemed the activities of the boarding houses to be inappropriate. Dart and Wigan still compete against each other in [[soccer]] and [[Australian rules football]] matches. These houses used to be one, and their subsequent division may be the cause of the competition. The Dart-Wigan rivalry is often overlooked when competing against the non-boarding (non-boarding) houses.\n\nThere are also three girls' boarding houses, Hayhoe, Woodbridge and Larritt. Larritt was created to accommodate the ever-increasing number of boarders, housing exclusively female boarders in years 7, 8 and 9. Larritt girls 'graduate' to Hayhoe and Woodbridge when they reach year 10.\n\nThere are also eight-day houses ($122/night if interested), four for girls and four for boys. The girls' day houses are Manifold, Krome, Cuthbert and Macpherson. The boys' houses are Smith, Butler, Robin and Nevett.\n\nAll houses are named after people who were important to the school such as former Headmasters/Headmistresses or substantial donors, and are paired in brother-sister groups. While the houses are generally independent, they compete together in a number of competitions.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n* Macpherson {{color box|white}}{{color box|red}} \u2013 Nevett {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}}\n* Manifold {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Smith {{color box|cream}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Woodbridge {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}} \u2013 Dart {{color box|red}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Hayhoe {{color box|green}}{{color box|blue}} \u2013 Wigan {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Cuthbert {{color box|purple}}{{color box|crimson}} \u2013 Robin  {{color box|gold}}{{color box|red}}\n* Krome {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Butler {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Larritt {{colour box|maroon}}{{colour box|gold}}\n\n== Chapel of St Mark ==\nLocated within the School grounds is the Chapel of St Mark.  Originally built as the School assembly hall (Manifold Hall), the building was transformed into a chapel when student numbers demanded a larger space.  Overseen by Senior Chaplain, the Revd Dr Timothy Gaden (great guy btw), the Chapel holds several school services each week. The services are open to students of all faiths and acknowledge the liturgical traditions and inclusive, sacramental and life-affirming theology of the Anglican Church of Australia. Baptisms, weddings and funerals for school families and the wider community are also regularly held in the Chapel of St Mark.\n\nNotably, each winter the Chapel plays host to the charitable drive ''Can the Chapel''.  Schoolhouses compete to donate non-perishable items, lining the walls (and aisles) of the Chapel. All proceeds are donated to Anglicare Ballarat and distributed to the needy within the Ballarat community.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main cat|People educated at Ballarat Grammar School}}\n\n;Academia\n*[[G.

Although both were originally small schools, many alumni have made significant contributions to the Nation, in politics, in academia, education and health services, in business and as musicians and artists.  Many are mentioned in the book.\n\nThere is also Mainly About Girls, A History of Queen\u2019s, Ballarat 1876 \u2013 1972 written by Susanne White and Winds of Influence, A History of Ballarat Grammar 1911 \u2013 1971 by Michael Boyle.\n\n==Headmasters==\n''Adam Heath'' has been the Headmaster since 2016.

The expansive campus stretches as far north as Norman St, and west towards Dare St. Both the ''Senior School'' and ''Junior School'' are situated on the same campus, sharing many facilities and resources. ''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts'' is accessed by students via the southern part of the campus, and by the general public via Howitt St.\n\n''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts (WCPA)'' was opened in 2006 through a partnership between the School and the wider Ballarat Community. The main auditorium seats 857 and the expansive stage area has the capacity to handle a range of performances. It is used by the School and also hosts community events and performances. Ballarat Grammar's ''Music School'' is located within the WCPA, featuring tutorial and rehearsal rooms, and a professional recording suite. The WCPA also features natural cooling using the catacombs and natural air-flow.\n\n''The Heinz Centre'' is an award-winning (2002 BEN Environment Award<ref name=\"ENDAward1\">[http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards 2002 BEN Environment Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811074454/http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards |date=11 August 2008 }} (accessed:20-07-2008)</ref> ) Year 9 Environmental Centre, opened in 2001.

The Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) crews compete in the annual \"Head of the Lake\", which is held at [[Lake Wendouree]].\n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Australian Rules Football team has had great success in recent years, winning the Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) Premiership every year since 2013. Coached by teacher Matt Hanlon, the team was first successful in the AFL Victoria Herald Sun Shield (HSS) Championship in 2014, where they claimed the School Girls Division 1 title. In 2015, the girls contested against [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies College]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] but lost in a close match, however it is worthy to note that the best on ground for that game was Rene Caris who was drafted to the Geelong Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft. In 2016 and 2017, the Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Football team triumphed in the Herald Sun Shield claiming Division 1 titles in successive years at RAMS Arena and the MCG respectfully. In 2017, Lauren Butler, who was drafted to the Collingwood Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft, was named best on ground in the Herald Sun Shield Grandfinal. In 2018, the team was unsuccessful in the Herald Sun Shield Grandfinal, where they were beaten by Hallam Secondary College at GMHBA Stadium, Geelong. \n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Athletic team has in recent years been successful, with the Senior Boys Athletics Team taking out the 2012 All Schools Knockout title.\n\n==House system==\n\nThe [[house system]] is very important to the structure of the school, and there is substantial rivalry between houses in swimming, athletics, choral competitions, and more. The house system also provides pastoral care and a degree of mentoring to students.  The rivalry is particularly seen between the two boys' boarding houses, Dart and Wigan, which often used to engage in pranks against each other. This practice was abandoned in 2007 after new administration deemed the activities of the boarding houses to be inappropriate. Dart and Wigan still compete against each other in [[soccer]] and [[Australian rules football]] matches. These houses used to be one, and their subsequent division may be the cause of the competition. The Dart-Wigan rivalry is often overlooked when competing against the \"day\" (non-boarding) houses.\n\nThere are also three girls' boarding houses, Hayhoe, Woodbridge and Larritt. Larritt was created to accommodate the ever-increasing number of boarders, housing exclusively female boarders in years 7, 8 and 9. Larritt girls 'graduate' to Hayhoe and Woodbridge when they reach year 10.\n\nThere are also eight day houses, four for girls and four for boys. The girls' day houses are Manifold, Krome, Cuthbert and Macpherson. The boys' houses are Smith, Butler, Robin and Nevett.\n\nAll houses are named after people who were important to the school such as former Headmasters/Headmistresses or substantial donors, and are paired in brother-sister groups. While the houses are generally independent, they compete together in a number of competitions.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n* Macpherson {{color box|white}}{{color box|red}} \u2013 Nevett {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}}\n* Manifold {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Smith {{color box|cream}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Woodbridge {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}} \u2013 Dart {{color box|red}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Hayhoe {{color box|green}}{{color box|blue}} \u2013 Wigan {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Cuthbert {{color box|purple}}{{color box|crimson}} \u2013 Robin  {{color box|gold}}{{color box|red}}\n* Krome {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Butler {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Larritt {{colour box|maroon}}{{colour box|gold}}\n\n== Chapel of St Mark ==\nLocated within the School grounds is the Chapel of St Mark.  Originally built as the School assembly hall (Manifold Hall), the building was transformed into a chapel when student numbers demanded a larger space.  Overseen by Senior Chaplain, the Revd Dr Timothy Gaden, the Chapel holds several school services each week. The services are open to students of all faiths and acknowledge the liturgical traditions and inclusive, sacramental and life-affirming theology of the Anglican Church of Australia. Baptisms, weddings and funerals for school families and the wider community are also regularly held in the Chapel of St Mark.\n\nNotably, each winter the Chapel plays host to the charitable drive ''Can the Chapel''.  School houses compete to donate non-perishable items, lining the walls (and aisles) of the Chapel. All proceeds are donated to Anglicare Ballarat, and distributed to the needy within the Ballarat community.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main cat|People educated at Ballarat Grammar School}}\n\n;Academia\n*[[G.
