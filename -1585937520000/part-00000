ELISA has been used as a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] tool in medicine, [[plant pathology]], and [[biotechnology]], as well as a [[quality control]] check in various industries.\n\nIn the most simple form of an ELISA, [[antigen]]s from the sample are attached to a surface. Then, a matching [[antibody]] is applied over the surface so it can bind to the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme, and in the final step, a substance containing the enzyme's [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] is added. The subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal, most commonly a color change.\n\nPerforming an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a [[polystyrene]] [[microtiter plate]]) either non-specifically (via [[adsorption]] to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a \"sandwich\" ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an [[enzyme]] or can itself be detected by a [[secondary antibody]] that is linked to an enzyme through [[bioconjugation]]. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild [[detergent]] solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] to produce a visible [[signal (information theory)|signal]], which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.\n\nOf note, ELISA can perform other forms of [[ligand binding assay]]s instead of strictly \"immuno\" assays, though the name carried the original \"immuno\" because of the common use and history of development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or \"immunosorbed\" by [[antigen-antibody interaction]]s to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well (e.g., a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase, which is part of the plate, and so are not easily reusable.\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the development of the ELISA, the only option for conducting an immunoassay was [[radioimmunoassay]], a technique using [[radioactive]]ly labeled antigens or antibodies. In radioimmunoassay, the radioactivity provides the signal, which indicates whether a specific antigen or antibody is present in the sample. Radioimmunoassay was first described in a scientific paper by [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] and [[Solomon Berson]] published in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yalow |first1=Rosalyn S. |last2=Berson |first2=Solomon A. |title=Immunoassay of endogenous plasma insulin in man |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=39 |issue= 7|pages=1157\u201375 |year=1960 |pmid=13846364 |pmc=441860 |doi=10.1172/JCI104130 }}</ref>\n\nAs radioactivity poses a potential health threat, a safer alternative was sought. A suitable alternative to radioimmunoassay would substitute a nonradioactive signal in place of the radioactive signal. When enzymes (such as [[horseradish peroxidase]]) react with appropriate substrates (such as [[ABTS]] or [[3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine|TMB]]), a change in color occurs, which is used as a signal. However, the signal has to be associated with the presence of antibody or antigen, which is why the enzyme has to be linked to an appropriate antibody. This linking process was independently developed by Stratis Avrameas and G. B. Pierce.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lequin |first1=R.

Often, this substrate changes color upon reaction with the enzyme.  \n*The higher the concentration of the primary antibody present in the serum, the stronger the color change. Often, a spectrometer is used to give quantitative values for color strength.\n\nThe enzyme acts as an amplifier; even if only few enzyme-linked antibodies remain bound, the enzyme molecules will produce many signal molecules. Within common-sense limitations, the enzyme can go on producing color indefinitely, but the more antibody is bound, the faster the color will develop. A major disadvantage of the direct ELISA is that the method of antigen immobilization is not specific; when serum is used as the source of test antigen, all proteins in the sample may stick to the microtiter plate well, so small concentrations of analyte in serum must compete with other serum proteins when binding to the well surface. The sandwich or indirect ELISA provides a solution to this problem, by using a \"capture\" antibody specific for the test antigen to pull it out of the serum's molecular mixture.\n\nELISA may be run in a qualitative or quantitative format. Qualitative results provide a simple positive or negative result (yes or no) for a sample. The cutoff between positive and negative is determined by the analyst and may be statistical. Two or three times the standard deviation (error inherent in a test) is often used to distinguish positive from negative samples. In quantitative ELISA, the optical density (OD) of the sample is compared to a standard curve, which is typically a serial dilution of a known-concentration solution of the target molecule.  For example, if a test sample returns an OD of 1.0, the point on the standard curve that gave OD = 1.0 must be of the same analyte concentration as the sample.\n\nThe use and meaning of the names \"indirect ELISA\" and \"direct ELISA\" differs in the literature and on web sites depending on the context of the experiment. When the presence of an antigen is analyzed, the name \"direct ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which only a labelled primary antibody is used, and the term \"indirect ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which the antigen is bound by the primary antibody which then is detected by a labeled secondary antibody. In the latter case a sandwich ELISA is clearly distinct from an indirect ELISA. When the \"primary\" antibody is of interest, e.g. in the case of immunization analyses, this antibody is directly detected by the secondary antibody and the term \"indirect ELISA\" applies to a setting with two antibodies.\n\n===Sandwich ELISA ===\n[[Image:ELISA-sandwich.svg|thumb|300px|'''A sandwich ELISA'''.

This primary antibody could also be in the serum of a donor to be tested for reactivity towards the antigen.\n# Enzyme-linked secondary antibodies are applied as detection antibodies that also bind specifically to the antibody's Fc region (nonspecific).\n# The plate is washed to remove the unbound antibody-enzyme conjugates.\n# A chemical is added to be converted by the enzyme into a color or fluorescent or electrochemical signal.\n# The absorbance or fluorescence or electrochemical signal (e.g., current) of the plate wells is measured to determine the presence and quantity of antigen.\n\nThe image to the right includes the use of a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme, though, in the technical sense, this is not necessary if the primary antibody is conjugated to an enzyme (which would be direct ELISA). However, the use of a secondary-antibody conjugate avoids the expensive process of creating enzyme-linked antibodies for every antigen one might want to detect. By using an enzyme-linked antibody that binds the Fc region of other antibodies, this same enzyme-linked antibody can be used in a variety of situations. Without the first layer of \"capture\" antibody, any proteins in the sample (including serum proteins) may competitively adsorb to the plate surface, lowering the quantity of antigen immobilized. Use of the purified specific antibody to attach the antigen to the plastic eliminates a need to purify the antigen from complicated mixtures before the measurement, simplifying the assay, and increasing the specificity and the sensitivity of the assay. A sandwich ELISA used for research often needs validation because of the risk of false positive results.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kragstrup|first1=Tue W|last2=Vorup-Jensen|first2=Thomas|last3=Deleuran|first3=Bent|last4=Hvid|first4=Malene|title=A simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients|journal=SpringerPlus|date=2013|volume=2|issue=1|pages=263|doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-263|pmid=23875127|pmc=3695686}}</ref>\n\n===Competitive ELISA===\nA third use of ELISA is through competitive binding. The steps for this ELISA are somewhat different from the first two examples:\n\n# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample).\n# These bound antibody/antigen complexes are then added to an antigen-coated well.\n# The plate is washed, so unbound antibodies are removed. (The more antigen in the sample, the more Ag-Ab complexes are formed and so there are less unbound antibodies available to bind to the antigen in the well, hence \"competition\".)\n# The [[secondary antibody]], specific to the primary antibody, is added. This second antibody is coupled to the enzyme.\n# A substrate is added, and remaining enzymes elicit a chromogenic or fluorescent signal.\n# The reaction is stopped to prevent eventual saturation of the signal.\n\nSome competitive ELISA kits include enzyme-linked antigen rather than enzyme-linked antibody. The labeled antigen competes for primary antibody binding sites with the sample antigen (unlabeled). The less antigen in the sample, the more labeled antigen is retained in the well and the stronger the signal.\n\nCommonly, the antigen is not first positioned in the well.\n\nFor the detection of HIV antibodies, the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, but there is no enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.\n\n===Reverse ELISA===\nA fourth ELISA test does not use the traditional wells.&nbsp; This test leaves the antigens suspended in the test fluid.<ref>{{cite patent|title=United States Patent: 7767404 - Apparatus and method for single-step immunosorbent assay for single and multiple analytes|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=4&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=charbonnet.INNM.&OS=IN/charbonnet&RS=IN/charbonnet|patent-number=7767404|issue-date=August 3, 2010|access-date=2018-11-02|inventor-last=Charbonnet|inventor-first=Derrick}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|title=United States Patent: 8735142 - Systems and methods for immunosorbent assays for single and multiple analytes|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=charbonnet.INNM.&OS=IN/charbonnet&RS=IN/charbonnet|patent-number=8735142|issue-date=May 27, 2014|access-date=2018-11-02|inventor-last=Charbonnet|inventor2-last=Evans|inventor-first=Derrick|inventor2-first=Norman Scott}}</ref>\n\n# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample)\n#A sufficient incubation period is provided to allow the antibodies to bind to the antigens.\n#The sample is then passed through the Scavenger container.&nbsp; This can be a test tube or a specifically designed flow through channel.&nbsp; The surface of the Scavenger container or channel has \u201cScavenger Antigens\u201d bound to it.&nbsp; These can be identical or sufficiently similar to the primary antigens that the free antibodies will bind.\n#The Scavenger container must have sufficient surface area and sufficient time to allow the Scavenger Antigens to bind to all the excess Antibodies introduced into the sample.\n#The sample, that now contains the tagged and bound antibodies, is passed through a detector.

In an ELISA, a person's serum is diluted 400 times and applied to a plate to which HIV antigens are attached. If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens. The plate is then washed to remove all other components of the serum. A specially prepared \"secondary antibody\" \u2014 an antibody that binds to other antibodies \u2014 is then applied to the plate, followed by another wash. This secondary antibody is chemically linked in advance to an enzyme.\n\nThus, the plate will contain enzyme in proportion to the amount of secondary antibody bound to the plate. A substrate for the enzyme is applied, and catalysis by the enzyme leads to a change in color or fluorescence. ELISA results are reported as a number; the most controversial aspect of this test is determining the \"cut-off\" point between a positive and a negative result.\n\nA cut-off point may be determined by comparing it with a known standard. If an ELISA test is used for drug screening at workplace, a cut-off concentration, 50&nbsp;ng/ml, for example, is established, and a sample containing the standard concentration of analyte will be prepared. Unknowns that generate a stronger signal than the known sample are \"positive.\" Those that generate weaker signal are \"negative\".\n\nDr Dennis E Bidwell and Alister Voller created the ELISA test to detect various kind of diseases, such as [[Dengue fever|dengue]], [[malaria]], [[Chagas disease]], [[paratuberculosis|Johne's disease]], and others.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=J.

ELISA has been used as a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] tool in medicine, [[plant pathology]], and [[biotechnology]], as well as a [[quality control]] check in various industries.\n\nIn the most simple form of an ELISA, [[antigen]]s from the sample are attached to a surface. Then, a matching [[antibody]] is applied over the surface so it can bind to the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme, and in the final step, a substance containing the enzyme's [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] is added. The subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal, most commonly a color change.\n\nPerforming an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a [[polystyrene]] [[microtiter plate]]) either non-specifically (via [[adsorption]] to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a \"sandwich\" ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an [[enzyme]] or can itself be detected by a [[secondary antibody]] that is linked to an enzyme through [[bioconjugation]]. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild [[detergent]] solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] to produce a visible [[signal (information theory)|signal]], which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.\n\nOf note, ELISA can perform other forms of [[ligand binding assay]]s instead of strictly \"immuno\" assays, though the name carried the original \"immuno\" because of the common use and history of development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or \"immunosorbed\" by [[antigen-antibody interaction]]s to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well (e.g., a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase, which is part of the plate, and so are not easily reusable.\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the development of the ELISA, the only option for conducting an immunoassay was [[radioimmunoassay]], a technique using [[radioactive]]ly labeled antigens or antibodies. In radioimmunoassay, the radioactivity provides the signal, which indicates whether a specific antigen or antibody is present in the sample. Radioimmunoassay was first described in a scientific paper by [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] and [[Solomon Berson]] published in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yalow |first1=Rosalyn S. |last2=Berson |first2=Solomon A. |title=Immunoassay of endogenous plasma insulin in man |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=39 |issue= 7|pages=1157\u201375 |year=1960 |pmid=13846364 |pmc=441860 |doi=10.1172/JCI104130 }}</ref>\n\nAs radioactivity poses a potential health threat, a safer alternative was sought. A suitable alternative to radioimmunoassay would substitute a nonradioactive signal in place of the radioactive signal. When enzymes (such as [[horseradish peroxidase]]) react with appropriate substrates (such as [[ABTS]] or [[3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine|TMB]]), a change in color occurs, which is used as a signal. However, the signal has to be associated with the presence of antibody or antigen, which is why the enzyme has to be linked to an appropriate antibody. This linking process was independently developed by Stratis Avrameas and G. B. Pierce.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lequin |first1=R.

Often, this substrate changes color upon reaction with the enzyme.  \n*The higher the concentration of the primary antibody present in the serum, the stronger the color change. Often, a spectrometer is used to give quantitative values for color strength.\n\nThe enzyme acts as an amplifier; even if only few enzyme-linked antibodies remain bound, the enzyme molecules will produce many signal molecules. Within common-sense limitations, the enzyme can go on producing color indefinitely, but the more antibody is bound, the faster the color will develop. A major disadvantage of the direct ELISA is that the method of antigen immobilization is not specific; when serum is used as the source of test antigen, all proteins in the sample may stick to the microtiter plate well, so small concentrations of analyte in serum must compete with other serum proteins when binding to the well surface. The sandwich or indirect ELISA provides a solution to this problem, by using a \"capture\" antibody specific for the test antigen to pull it out of the serum's molecular mixture.\n\nELISA may be run in a qualitative or quantitative format. Qualitative results provide a simple positive or negative result (yes or no) for a sample. The cutoff between positive and negative is determined by the analyst and may be statistical. Two or three times the standard deviation (error inherent in a test) is often used to distinguish positive from negative samples. In quantitative ELISA, the optical density (OD) of the sample is compared to a standard curve, which is typically a serial dilution of a known-concentration solution of the target molecule.  For example, if a test sample returns an OD of 1.0, the point on the standard curve that gave OD = 1.0 must be of the same analyte concentration as the sample.\n\nThe use and meaning of the names \"indirect ELISA\" and \"direct ELISA\" differs in the literature and on web sites depending on the context of the experiment. When the presence of an antigen is analyzed, the name \"direct ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which only a labelled primary antibody is used, and the term \"indirect ELISA\" refers to an ELISA in which the antigen is bound by the primary antibody which then is detected by a labeled secondary antibody. In the latter case a sandwich ELISA is clearly distinct from an indirect ELISA. When the \"primary\" antibody is of interest, e.g. in the case of immunization analyses, this antibody is directly detected by the secondary antibody and the term \"indirect ELISA\" applies to a setting with two antibodies.\n\n===Sandwich ELISA ===\n[[Image:ELISA-sandwich.svg|thumb|300px|'''A sandwich ELISA'''. (1) Plate is coated with a capture antibody; (2) sample is added, and any antigen present binds to capture antibody; (3) detecting antibody is added, and binds to antigen; (4) enzyme-linked secondary antibody is added, and binds to detecting antibody; (5) substrate is added, and is converted by enzyme to detectable form.]]\n\nA \"sandwich\" ELISA is used to detect sample antigen.<ref name=\"Schmidt2012\">{{Cite book |last1=Schmidt |first1=SD |last2=Mazzella |first2=MJ |last3=Nixon |first3=RA |last4=Mathews |first4=PM |title=A\u03b2 measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay |journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=849 |pages=507\u201327 |year=2012 |pmid=22528112 |doi=10.1007/978-1-61779-551-0_34 |isbn=978-1-61779-550-3 }}</ref> The steps are:\n\n# A surface is prepared to which a known quantity of capture antibody is bound.\n# Any nonspecific binding sites on the surface are blocked.\n# The antigen-containing sample is applied to the plate, and captured by antibody.\n# The plate  is washed to remove unbound antigen.\n# A  specific antibody is added, and binds to antigen (hence the 'sandwich': the antigen is stuck between two antibodies). This primary antibody could also be in the serum of a donor to be tested for reactivity towards the antigen.\n# Enzyme-linked secondary antibodies are applied as detection antibodies that also bind specifically to the antibody's Fc region (nonspecific).\n# The plate is washed to remove the unbound antibody-enzyme conjugates.\n# A chemical is added to be converted by the enzyme into a color or fluorescent or electrochemical signal.\n# The absorbance or fluorescence or electrochemical signal (e.g., current) of the plate wells is measured to determine the presence and quantity of antigen.\n\nThe image to the right includes the use of a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme, though, in the technical sense, this is not necessary if the primary antibody is conjugated to an enzyme (which would be direct ELISA). However, the use of a secondary-antibody conjugate avoids the expensive process of creating enzyme-linked antibodies for every antigen one might want to detect. By using an enzyme-linked antibody that binds the Fc region of other antibodies, this same enzyme-linked antibody can be used in a variety of situations. Without the first layer of \"capture\" antibody, any proteins in the sample (including serum proteins) may competitively adsorb to the plate surface, lowering the quantity of antigen immobilized. Use of the purified specific antibody to attach the antigen to the plastic eliminates a need to purify the antigen from complicated mixtures before the measurement, simplifying the assay, and increasing the specificity and the sensitivity of the assay. A sandwich ELISA used for research often needs validation because of the risk of false positive results.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kragstrup|first1=Tue W|last2=Vorup-Jensen|first2=Thomas|last3=Deleuran|first3=Bent|last4=Hvid|first4=Malene|title=A simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients|journal=SpringerPlus|date=2013|volume=2|issue=1|pages=263|doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-263|pmid=23875127|pmc=3695686}}</ref>\n\n===Competitive ELISA===\nA third use of ELISA is through competitive binding. The steps for this ELISA are somewhat different from the first two examples:\n\n# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample).\n# These bound antibody/antigen complexes are then added to an antigen-coated well.\n# The plate is washed, so unbound antibodies are removed. (The more antigen in the sample, the more Ag-Ab complexes are formed and so there are less unbound antibodies available to bind to the antigen in the well, hence \"competition\".)\n# The [[secondary antibody]], specific to the primary antibody, is added. This second antibody is coupled to the enzyme.\n# A substrate is added, and remaining enzymes elicit a chromogenic or fluorescent signal.\n# The reaction is stopped to prevent eventual saturation of the signal.\n\nSome competitive ELISA kits include enzyme-linked antigen rather than enzyme-linked antibody. The labeled antigen competes for primary antibody binding sites with the sample antigen (unlabeled). The less antigen in the sample, the more labeled antigen is retained in the well and the stronger the signal.\n\nCommonly, the antigen is not first positioned in the well.\n\nFor the detection of HIV antibodies, the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, but there is no enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.\n\n===Reverse ELISA===\nA fourth ELISA test does not use the traditional wells.&nbsp; This test leaves the antigens suspended in the test fluid.<ref>{{cite patent|title=United States Patent: 7767404 - Apparatus and method for single-step immunosorbent assay for single and multiple analytes|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=4&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=charbonnet.INNM.&OS=IN/charbonnet&RS=IN/charbonnet|patent-number=7767404|issue-date=August 3, 2010|access-date=2018-11-02|inventor-last=Charbonnet|inventor-first=Derrick}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|title=United States Patent: 8735142 - Systems and methods for immunosorbent assays for single and multiple analytes|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=charbonnet.INNM.&OS=IN/charbonnet&RS=IN/charbonnet|patent-number=8735142|issue-date=May 27, 2014|access-date=2018-11-02|inventor-last=Charbonnet|inventor2-last=Evans|inventor-first=Derrick|inventor2-first=Norman Scott}}</ref>\n\n# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample)\n#A sufficient incubation period is provided to allow the antibodies to bind to the antigens.\n#The sample is then passed through the Scavenger container.&nbsp; This can be a test tube or a specifically designed flow through channel.&nbsp; The surface of the Scavenger container or channel has \u201cScavenger Antigens\u201d bound to it.&nbsp; These can be identical or sufficiently similar to the primary antigens that the free antibodies will bind.\n#The Scavenger container must have sufficient surface area and sufficient time to allow the Scavenger Antigens to bind to all the excess Antibodies introduced into the sample.\n#The sample, that now contains the tagged and bound antibodies, is passed through a detector.

In an ELISA, a person's serum is diluted 400 times and applied to a plate to which HIV antigens are attached. If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens. The plate is then washed to remove all other components of the serum. A specially prepared \"secondary antibody\" \u2014 an antibody that binds to other antibodies \u2014 is then applied to the plate, followed by another wash. This secondary antibody is chemically linked in advance to an enzyme.\n\nThus, the plate will contain enzyme in proportion to the amount of secondary antibody bound to the plate. A substrate for the enzyme is applied, and catalysis by the enzyme leads to a change in color or fluorescence. ELISA results are reported as a number; the most controversial aspect of this test is determining the \"cut-off\" point between a positive and a negative result.\n\nA cut-off point may be determined by comparing it with a known standard. If an ELISA test is used for drug screening at workplace, a cut-off concentration, 50&nbsp;ng/ml, for example, is established, and a sample containing the standard concentration of analyte will be prepared. Unknowns that generate a stronger signal than the known sample are \"positive.\" Those that generate weaker signal are \"negative\".\n\nDr Dennis E Bidwell and Alister Voller created the ELISA test to detect various kind of diseases, such as [[Dengue fever|dengue]], [[malaria]], [[Chagas disease]], [[paratuberculosis|Johne's disease]], and others.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=J.

His most important influence at university was probably from [[David Thomson (physicist)|Prof David Thomson]]. In 1863 they jointly repaired the university clock and both set up a new mechanical telescope at the Cromwell Tower Observatory. This was his introduction to astronomy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/npmuseum/article/Profs/ThomsonUni.shtml |title = David Thomson Aberdeen University}}</ref>\n\nIt would seem that Gill's interests lay elsewhere since after a few years he sold the business, and then spent time equipping [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|Lord Lindsay]]'s private observatory at [[Dunecht|Dun Echt]], [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]]. In 1874, Gill joined the expedition to [[Mauritius]] to observe the [[transit of Venus]]. Three years later he went to [[Ascension Island]] to observe a near approach of [[Mars]] and to calculate its distance. While carrying out these laborious calculations, he was notified of his appointment to the [[Cape Observatory]], which, over the following 27 years he was to refurbish completely, turning it into a first-rate institution. Gill was a meticulous observer and had a flair for getting the best out of his instruments. His [[solar parallax]] observations with a [[heliometer]] and his calculations of distances to the nearer stars, are testimony to his outstanding work. He recruited [[Robert T. A. Innes|Robert Innes]] to the [[Cape Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal | bibcode = 1933AN....249...51D | title = Anzeige des Todes von Robert Thorburn Ayton Innes | journal = Astronomische Nachrichten | volume=249 | page=51 | year = 1933 | last=Davidson | first= M. | language = German | doi=10.1002/asna.19332490203}}</ref>\n\nGill used the [[parallax]] of Mars to determine the distance to the [[Sun]],<ref>{{cite journal\n | title=Gill's Work on the Determination of the Solar Parallax | journal=Monthly Notes of the Astronomical Society of South Africa\n | volume=2 | pages=85\u201388 | year=1943\n | bibcode=1943MNSSA...2...85. }}</ref> and also measured distances to the [[star]]s.  He perfected the use of the heliometer.  He was Her Majesty's Astronomer at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] from 1879 to 1906. He was a pioneer in the use of [[astrophotography]], making the first photograph of the [[Great Comet of 1882]], and one of the early proponents of the ''[[Carte du Ciel]]'' project.\n\nThe invention of [[dry plate]] photography by [[Richard Leach Maddox]] made Gill realise that the process could be used to create images of the stars and to more easily determine their relative positions and brightness. This led to a massive project in collaboration with the Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn|J.C. Kapteyn]], and the compiling of an index of brightness and position for some half a million southern stars. The work was published as ''[[Cape Photographic Durchmusterung]]'' in 3 volumes between 1896 and 1900. Gill also played a leading role in the organising of the ''Carte du Ciel'', an ambitious international venture aimed at mapping the entire sky. He initiated the idea of a geodetic survey along the 30th east meridian stretching from South Africa to [[Norway]], resulting in the longest meridian yet measured on Earth.\n\nHis concern with measurement led to him becoming a member of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) from 1907 - 1914. <ref>{{cite book |last1=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards |editor1-last=Page |editor1-first=Chester H. |editor2-last=Vigoureux |editor2-first=Paul |title=The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 1875-1975 |date=1975 |edition=National Bureau of Standards Special Publication 420 |url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nbsspecialpublication420.pdf |accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref> As president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he gave a presidential address in 1907 in which he advocated definitions based on fundamental physical properties, rather than on arbitrary standards such as a  rod of metal with lines ruled upon it to mark the yard or metre.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=David |title=Address of the President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science |journal=Science |date=1907 |volume=26 |issue=659 |pages=193\u2013212 |jstor=1632686 |doi=10.1126/science.26.659.193 |pmid=17819107 |bibcode=1907Sci....26..193G }}</ref> \n\nGill married Isobel Black in 1870, and she accompanied him to Ascension Island for his Mars observations.<ref>For her description of the expedition, see {{cite book | author = Gill, Isabel Sarah B. | title = Six Months in Ascension: An Unscientific Account of a Scientific Expedition | year = 1878 | publisher = John Murray | location = London | url = https://books.google.com/?id=vg8IAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Six+Months+in+Ascension }}</ref>  On Gill's retirement in 1906, the couple moved to London, where Gill served for two years (1909\u20131911) as president of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] before his death in 1914.  \n\nHe was buried with his sister, Isobel Sarah Gill, in the grounds of [[St Machar's Cathedral]], Aberdeen.<ref>{{cite journal | author = | title = Sir David Gill | year = 1914 | journal = The Observatory | volume = 37 | pages = 115\u2013117 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/Obs../0037//0000115.000.html | accessdate = 17 May 2008 | bibcode = 1914Obs....37..115.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hughes, Stefan|title=Catchers of the Light: The Forgotten Lives of the Men and Women Who First Photographed the Heavens|year=2012|page=1016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZk5OOf7fVYC&pg=PA1016|isbn=9781620509616}}</ref> The grave lies on the east outer wall of the church.\n\n== Selected writings ==\nHis writings include:\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Gill|first1=Sir David |last2=Elkin|first2=William Lewis |title=Heliometer-determinations of Stellar Parallax in the Southern Hemisphere|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpMoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1|year=1884|publisher=Royal Astronomical Society|display-authors=0}}\n*{{cite journal|title=A Determination of the Solar Parallax and Mass of the Moon from Heliometer Observations of Victoria and Sappho|journal=Annals of the Cape Observatory|date=1897|volume= 6|pp=iii-5.32|bibcode=1897AnCap...6A...1G|last1=Gill|first1=David|last2=Auwers|first2=Arthur}}\n*\"A Determination of the Solar Parallax from Observations of Mars at the Island of Ascension\" (in the ''Memoirs of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]'', volumes xlvi and xlviii, 1881 and 1885).

He spent much of his career in South Africa.\n\n== Life and work ==\n[[File:The grave of David Gill, St Machar's Cathedral.jpg|thumb|330px|The grave of David Gill, St Machar's Cathedral]]\nDavid Gill was born at 48 Skene Terrace in [[Aberdeen]] the son of David Gill, watchmaker and his wife Margaret Mitchell.

His most important influence at university was probably from [[David Thomson (physicist)|Prof David Thomson]]. In 1863 they jointly repaired the university clock and both set up a new mechanical telescope at the Cromwell Tower Observatory. This was his introduction to astronomy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/npmuseum/article/Profs/ThomsonUni.shtml |title = David Thomson Aberdeen University}}</ref>\n\nIt would seem that Gill's interests lay elsewhere since after a few years he sold the business, and then spent time equipping [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|Lord Lindsay]]'s private observatory at [[Dunecht|Dun Echt]], [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]]. In 1874, Gill joined the expedition to [[Mauritius]] to observe the [[transit of Venus]]. Three years later he went to [[Ascension Island]] to observe a near approach of [[Mars]] and to calculate its distance. While carrying out these laborious calculations, he was notified of his appointment to the [[Cape Observatory]], which, over the following 27 years he was to refurbish completely, turning it into a first-rate institution. Gill was a meticulous observer and had a flair for getting the best out of his instruments. His [[solar parallax]] observations with a [[heliometer]] and his calculations of distances to the nearer stars, are testimony to his outstanding work. He recruited [[Robert T. A. Innes|Robert Innes]] to the [[Cape Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal | bibcode = 1933AN....249...51D | title = Anzeige des Todes von Robert Thorburn Ayton Innes | journal = Astronomische Nachrichten | volume=249 | page=51 | year = 1933 | last=Davidson | first= M. | language = German | doi=10.1002/asna.19332490203}}</ref>\n\nGill used the [[parallax]] of Mars to determine the distance to the [[Sun]],<ref>{{cite journal\n | title=Gill's Work on the Determination of the Solar Parallax | journal=Monthly Notes of the Astronomical Society of South Africa\n | volume=2 | pages=85\u201388 | year=1943\n | bibcode=1943MNSSA...2...85. }}</ref> and also measured distances to the [[star]]s.  He perfected the use of the heliometer.  He was Her Majesty's Astronomer at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] from 1879 to 1906. He was a pioneer in the use of [[astrophotography]], making the first photograph of the [[Great Comet of 1882]], and one of the early proponents of the ''[[Carte du Ciel]]'' project.\n\nThe invention of [[dry plate]] photography by [[Richard Leach Maddox]] made Gill realise that the process could be used to create images of the stars and to more easily determine their relative positions and brightness. This led to a massive project in collaboration with the Dutch astronomer [[Jacobus Kapteyn|J.C. Kapteyn]], and the compiling of an index of brightness and position for some half a million southern stars. The work was published as ''[[Cape Photographic Durchmusterung]]'' in 3 volumes between 1896 and 1900. Gill also played a leading role in the organising of the ''Carte du Ciel'', an ambitious international venture aimed at mapping the entire sky.
